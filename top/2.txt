Random simplicial complexes are tools from algebraic topology which provide an accurate and tractable representation of the topology of wireless sensor networks. Given a simplicial complex, we present an algorithm which reduces the number of its vertices, keeping its homology (i.e. connectivity, coverage) unchanged. We show that the algorithm reaches a Nash equilibrium, moreover we find both a lower and an upper bounds for the number of vertices removed, the complexity of the algorithm, and the maximal order of the resulting complex for the coverage problem. We also give some simulation results for classical cases, especially coverage complexes simulating wireless sensor networks.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'475-479', u'year': u'2013', u'keywords': u'game theory;telecommunication network topology;wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor network topology;reduction algorithm;power consumption;supernumerary sensors;random simplicial complexes;algebraic topology;homology;Nash equilibrium;coverage problem;Sensors;Abstracts;Indexes;Wireless sensor networks;Topology;Face;Network topology', 'ID': u'6566818', u'booktitle': u'2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

Yu and Haiying Shen and Chen Wang and Wei Lu', u'title': u'Efficient algorithms for sensor deployment and routing in sensor networks for network-structured environment monitoring', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'When monitoring environments with wireless sensor networks, optimal sensor deployment is a fundamental issue and an effective means to achieve desired performance. Selecting best sensor deployment has a dependence on the deployment environments. Existing works address sensor deployment within three types of environments including one dimensional line, 2-D field and 3-D space. However, in many applications the deployment environments usually have network structures, which cannot be simply classified as the three types. The deployed locations and communications of sensor nodes are limited onto the network edges, which make the deployment problem distinct from that in other types of environments. In this paper, we study sensor deployment in network-structured environments and aim to achieve k-coverage while minimizing the number of sensor nodes. Furthermore, we jointly consider the optimization of sink deployment and routing strategies with the goal to minimize the network communication cost of data collection. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to tackle sensor/sink deployment under the deployment constraints imposed by the network structure. The hardness of the problems is shown. Polynomial-time algorithms are proposed to determine optimal sensor/sink deployment and routing strategies in tree-topology network structure. Efficient approximation algorithms are proposed for the general graph network structure and their performances are analyzed. Theoretical results and extensive simulations show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1008-1016', u'year': u'2012', u'keywords': u'optimisation;sensor placement;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks;sensor deployment;sensor network routing;network structured environment monitoring;wireless sensor network;k-coverage;network communication cost;data collection;hard problems;polynomial time algorithms;Monitoring;Routing;Wireless sensor networks;Approximation algorithms;Sensors;Pipelines;Topology', 'ID': u'6195455', u'booktitle': u'2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

However, increases in bandwidth have been accompanied by increases in power consumption, and despite sustained system design efforts to address power demand, significant technological challenges remain that threaten to slow future bandwidth growth. In this paper we describe the power and associated heat management challenges in today's routers. We advocate a broad approach to addressing this problem that includes making power-awareness a primary objective in the design and configuration of networks, and in the design and implementation of network protocols. We support our arguments by providing a case study of power demands of two standard router platforms that enables us to create a generic model for router power consumption. We apply this model in a set of target network configurations and use mixed integer optimization techniques to investigate power consumption, performance and robustness in static network design and in dynamic routing. Our results indicate the potential for significant power savings in operational networks by including power-awareness.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'457-465', u'year': u'2008', u'keywords': u'Internet;power aware computing;protocols;telecommunication network routing;power awareness;network design;network routing;exponential bandwidth scaling;Internet;power consumption;network protocols;Routing;Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Power demand;Internet;Energy management;Power system management;Protocols;Design optimization;Robustness', 'ID': u'4509688', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications'}
