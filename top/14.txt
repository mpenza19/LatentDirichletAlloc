Deriving position information by using the capability of the nodes to measure time of arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA), angle of arrival (AOA) and signal strength have been used to localize nodes relative to a frame of reference. The nodes in an ad-hoc network can have multiple capabilities and exploiting one or more of the capabilities can improve the quality of positioning. In this paper, we show how AOA capability of the nodes can be used to derive position information. We propose a method for all nodes to determine their orientation and position in an ad-hoc network where only a fraction of the nodes have positioning capabilities, under the assumption that each node has the AOA capability.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'3', u'pages': u'1734-1743 vol.3', u'year': u'2003', u'keywords': u'ad hoc networks;direction-of-arrival estimation;telecommunication network routing;ad hoc positioning system;APS;angle of arrival;AOA;ad-hoc network;node position information;time of arrival;TOA;time difference of arrival;TDOA;signal strength;positioning quality;node orientation;digital compass;Ad hoc networks;Routing;Global Positioning System;Position measurement;Time measurement;Time difference of arrival;Humans;Meteorology;Cost function;Protocols', 'ID': u'1209196', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2003.

Contention-less slots are assigned by the head end to end stations according to a reservation scheme. Contention-based slots are randomly accessed by active terminals without any preliminary allocation, so that collisions may occur. To resolve contention, the contention tree algorithm has been widely accepted by the DVB/DAVIC, IEEE 802.14 and DOCSIS standards for MAC because of higher throughput and lower access delay. In this paper we propose a novel contention resolution mechanism and compare its performance with that of existing procedures. The proposed procedure is termed as static arrival slot mechanism. In this mechanism, one slot in each frame is exclusively reserved for new arrivals that wish to access the channel using contention resolution, and at least one slot is reserved for resolving their contention if there was one in the arrival slot. The performance of the proposed mechanism is evaluated through analysis and simulation. The results show that the proposed mechanism outperforms existing contention resolution procedures under heavy traffic.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'979-989 vol.2', u'year': u'2003', u'keywords': u'access protocols;cable television;digital video broadcasting;hybrid fibre coax networks;telecommunication traffic;contention resolution mechanism;HFC networks upstream channel;hybrid fiber coaxial access networks;MAC;medium access control scheme;DAVIC;DVB;IEEE 802.14;DOCSIS standards;contention-based time slot assignment;contention-less time slot assignment;head end to end stations;reservation scheme;active terminals;contention tree algorithm;access delay;static arrival slot mechanism;frame slot;arrival slot;simulation;traffic;sojourn time;waiting time;Intelligent networks;Hybrid fiber coaxial cables;Helium;Media Access Protocol;Digital video broadcasting;Access protocols;Mathematics;Computer science;USA Councils;Delay', 'ID': u'1208935', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2003.

Xiong', u'title': u'Secure continuous aggregation via sampling-based verification in wireless sensor networks', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'In-network aggregation provides an energy-efficient way to extract summarization information from sensor networks. Continuous aggregation is usually required in many sensor applications to obtain the temporal variation information of some interesting aggregates. However, for the continuous in-network aggregation in a hostile environment, the adversary could manipulate a series of aggregation results through compromised nodes to fabricate false temporal variation patterns of the aggregates. Existing secure aggregation schemes conduct one individual verification for each aggregation result. Due to the high rate and the long period of a continuous aggregation, directly applying these schemes to detect false temporal variation pattern would incur a great communication cost. In this paper, we identify distinct design issues for protecting continuous in-network aggregation and propose a novel scheme to detect false temporal variation patterns. Compared with the existing schemes, our scheme greatly reduces the communication cost by selecting and checking only a small part of aggregation results to verify the correctness of the temporal variation patterns in a time window. The checking of the aggregation results uses a sampling-based approach, which enables our scheme independent of any particular in-network aggregation protocol. We also propose a series of security mechanisms to protect the sampling process. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1763-1771', u'year': u'2011', u'keywords': u'pattern recognition;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks;secure continuous aggregation;sampling-based verification;wireless sensor networks;in-network aggregation;false temporal variation pattern detection;security mechanisms;Base stations;Authentication;Aggregates;Heuristic algorithms;Approximation methods;Protocols', 'ID': u'5934974', u'booktitle': u'2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

Khan', u'title': u'A Novel Quantitative Approach For Measuring Network Security', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Evaluation of network security is an essential step in securing any network. This evaluation can help security professionals in making optimal decisions about how to design security countermeasures, to choose between alternative security architectures, and to systematically modify security configurations in order to improve security. However, the security of a network depends on a number of dynamically changing factors such as emergence of new vulnerabilities and threats, policy structure and network traffic. Identifying, quantifying and validating these factors using security metrics is a major challenge in this area. In this paper, we propose a novel security metric framework that identifies and quantifies objectively the most significant security risk factors, which include existing vulnerabilities, historical trend of vulnerability of the remotely accessible services, prediction of potential vulnerabilities for any general network service and their estimated severity and finally policy resistance to attack propagation within the network. We then describe our rigorous validation experiments using real- life vulnerability data of the past 6 years from National Vulnerability Database (NVD) [10] to show the high accuracy and confidence of the proposed metrics. Some previous works have considered vulnerabilities using code analysis. However, as far as we know, this is the first work to study and analyze these metrics for network security evaluation using publicly available vulnerability information and security policy configuration.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1957-1965', u'year': u'2008', u'keywords': u'risk analysis;security;network security;policy structure;network traffic;security metric framework;remotely accessible services;real life vulnerability data;national vulnerability database;Data security;Information security;National security;Communication system security;Telecommunication traffic;Databases;Information analysis;Computer science;Communications Society;Risk analysis', 'ID': u'4509855', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications'}

One of the key enablers for business applications is the ability to setup secure channels across the Internet. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol provides this capability and it is the most widely used transport layer security protocol. In this paper we investigate the performance of SSL both from a latency as well as a throughput point of view. Since SSL is primarily used to secure Web transactions, we use the SPECWeb96 benchmark suitably modified for use with the SSL protocol. We benchmark two of the more popular Web servers that are in use today and find that they are a couple of orders of magnitude slower when it comes to serving secure Web pages. We investigate the reason for this deficiency by instrumenting the SSL protocol stack with a detailed profiling of the protocol processing components. Based on our findings we suggest two modifications to the protocol that reduce the latency as well as increase the throughput at the server.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'717-725 vol.2', u'year': u'1999', u'keywords': u'transport protocols;telecommunication security;Internet;business communication;transport layer security;secure channels;Internet;Secure Sockets Layer protocol;business communication;latency;throughput;Web transactions;SPECWeb96 benchmark;SSL protocol;Web servers;HTTP;Security;Costs;Internet;Transport protocols;Delay;Throughput;Sockets;Web server;Web pages;Instruments', 'ID': u'751458', u'booktitle': u"IEEE INFOCOM '99.
