In this paper, we study the problem of automatically detecting driver phone calls by monitoring smartphone activities and utilizing the vehicle on-board unit. The challenges to overcome include: i) passenger phone calls should be allowed while the calls of the driver should be blocked; ii) the detection mechanism should be phone position-independent and phone owner-independent as the driver may put the smartphone at any position in the front row and make calls via an earphone, or the driver may borrow a passenger's phone to make a call; iii) the in-vehicle environment is noisy resulted from the operating engine, the music the driver and passenger may listen to, and the conversation between passengers and/or the driver; and iv) the computational cost at the smartphone should be light as realtime phone call detection is expected to effectively block an ongoing call to and from the driver. To overcome these challenges and achieve our objective of detecting driver phone calls, we take advantage of the uniqueness of individual's voice features. Through a short period of learning stage, our proposed system can recognize the driver's voice from the collected audio data. Combined with the smartphone's call state, our scheme can determine whether the driver is participating in the current phone call or not. Our strategy takes into account the complicated in-vehicle environment, and the proposed algorithm does not rely on the location of the phone within the vehicle nor the ownership of the smartphone, as the most existing driver phone call detection mechanisms do. We develop a client-server based system with the smartphones being the clients and the vehicle on-board unit being the server. To validate our mechanism, we perform extensive real-world experiments under different scenarios. The results demonstrate a high probability of detecting driver phone calls with a small false alarm rate.", u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2016', u'keywords': u'client-server systems;road accidents;road safety;speech recognition;traffic engineering computing;driver phone call automatic detection;voice features;mobile phones;car accidents;smartphone activities monitoring;vehicle on-board unit;position-independent phone call detection mechanism;owner-independent phone call detection mechanism;driver voice recognition;client-server based system;Cellular phones;Automobiles;Feature extraction;Microphones;Accidents;Monitoring;Driver phone use;driver phone call detection;speaker recognition;driver distraction', 'ID': u'7524437', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}

The basic idea in DiffProbe is to compare the delays and packet losses experienced by two flows: an Application flow A and a Probing flow P.

Ross', u'title': u'BitTorrent Darknets', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'A private BitTorrent site (also known as a "Bit Torrent darknet") is a collection of torrents that can only be accessed by members of the darknet community. The private BitTorrent sites also have incentive policies which encourage users to continue to seed files after completing downloading. Although there are at least 800 independent BitTorrent darknets in the Internet, they have received little attention in the research community to date. We examine BitTorrent darknets from macroscopic, medium-scopic and microscopic perspectives. For the macroscopic analysis, we consider 800+ private sites to obtain a broad picture of the darknet landscape, and obtain a rough estimate of the total number of files, accounts, and simultaneous peers within the entire darknet landscape. Although the size of each private site is relatively small, we find the aggregate size of the darknet landscape to be surprisingly large. For the medium-scopic analysis, we investigate content overlap between four private sites and the public BitTorrent ecosystem. For the microscopic analysis, we explore in-depth one private site and examine its user behavior. We observe that the seed-to-leecher ratios and upload-to-download ratios are much higher than in the public ecosystem. The macroscopic, medium-scopic and microscopic analyses when combined provide a vivid picture of the darknet landscape, and provide insight into how the darknet landscape differs from the public BitTorrent ecosystem.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2010', u'keywords': u'Internet;Web sites;BitTorrent darknet landscape;private BitTorrent sites;Internet;medium-scopic analysis;microscopic analysis;public BitTorrent ecosystem;Microscopy;Ecosystems;Internet;Communications Society;Chaotic communication;Sun;Regression analysis;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Aggregates', 'ID': u'5461962', u'booktitle': u'2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

Mohapatra', u'title': u'Identity-based attack detection in mobile wireless networks', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u"Identity-based attacks (IBAs) are one of the most serious threats to wireless networks. Recently, received signal strength (RSS) based detection mechanisms were proposed to detect IBAs in static networks. Although mobility is an inherent property of wireless networks, limited work has addressed IBA detection in mobile scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel RSS based technique, Reciprocal Channel Variation-based Identification (RCVI), to detect IBAs in mobile wireless networks. RCVI takes advantage of the location decorrelation, randomness, and reciprocity of the wireless fading channel to decide if all packets come from a single sender or more. If the packets are only coming from the genuine sender, the RSS variations reported by the sender should be correlated with the receiver's observations. Otherwise, the correlation should be degraded, then an attack can be flagged. We evaluate RCVI through theoretical analysis, and validate it through experiments using off-the-shelf 802.11 devices under different attacking patterns in real indoor and outdoor mobile scenarios. We show that RCVI can detect IBAs with a high probability even when the attacker is half a meter away from the genuine user.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1880-1888', u'year': u'2011', u'keywords': u'fading channels;mobile radio;radio networks;wireless LAN;identity-based attack detection;mobile wireless networks;received signal strength;reciprocal channel variation-based identification;RCVI;wireless fading channel;802.11 devices;Correlation;Wireless networks;Mobile communication;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile computing;Fading', 'ID': u'5934990', u'booktitle': u'2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

Unfortunately, comparing results across multiple studies is difficult. A key contributor to that difficulty is network geometry - the spatial arrangement of hosts and links. In this paper, we study the relationship between network geometry and geolocation accuracy. We define the notion of scaling dimension to characterize the geometry of a wide array of different networks. We show that the scaling dimension correlates with a number of aspects of geolocation accuracy. In networks with low scaling dimension, geolocation accuracy improves more rapidly with the addition of landmarks. Further, we show that the scaling dimension of operator networks varies considerably across different regions of the world. Our results point to the complexity of, and suggest standards for, the meaningful evaluation of geolocation algorithms.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'75-79', u'year': u'2013', u'keywords': u'geometry;Global Positioning System;Internet;network theory (graphs);network host geographic position estimation;network geometry;spatial host arrangement;spatial link arrangement;measurement-based geolocation method;geolocation accuracy;scaling dimension notion;operator network;Geology;Accuracy;Extraterrestrial measurements;Geometry;Delays;Network topology;Internet', 'ID': u'6566738', u'booktitle': u'2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}
