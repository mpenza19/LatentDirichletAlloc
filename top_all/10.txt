We show that such transceivers can be used to efficiently "groom" sub-wavelength traffic in the optical domain and so can significantly reduce the number of electronic ports compared to the fixed tuned case. We provide a new formulation for this "tunable grooming" problem. We show that in general this problem is NP-complete, but we are able to efficiently solve it for many cases of interest. When the number of wavelengths in the network is not limited, we show that each node only needs the minimum number of transceivers (i.e., no more transceivers than the amount of traffic that it generates). This holds regardless of the network topology or traffic pattern. When the number of wavelengths is limited, we show an analogous result for both uniform and hub traffic in a ring. We also develop a heuristic algorithm for general traffic that uses nearly the minimum number of transceivers. In most cases, tunable transceivers are shown to reduce the number of ports per node by as much as 60%.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'1340-1351 vol.2', u'year': u'2004', u'keywords': u'wavelength division multiplexing;time division multiplexing;telecommunication traffic;optimisation;optical fibre networks;telecommunication network topology;electronic port count;WDM network;wavelength division multiplexing;time division multiplexing;TDM network;tunable transceiver;NP-complete problem;hub traffic;heuristic algorithm;Intelligent networks;Wavelength division multiplexing;WDM networks;Time division multiplexing;Telecommunication traffic;Transceivers;Passive optical networks;Optical fiber networks;SONET;Costs', 'ID': u'1357019', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2004'}

Part I-Protection', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'This investigation considers optical networks which employ wavelength cross-connects that enable the establishment of wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) channels, between node-pairs. In such and other networks, the failure of a network element (e.g., fiber link, cross-connect, etc.) may cause the failure of several optical channels, thereby leading to large data losses. This study examines different approaches to protect mesh based WDM optical networks from single-link failures. These approaches are based on two basic survivability paradigms: (a) path protection/restoration, and (b) link protection/restoration. In path- and link-protection schemes, backup paths and wavelengths are reserved in advance at the time of call setup. Path- and link-restoration schemes are dynamic schemes in which backup paths are discovered (from the spare capacity in the network) upon the occurrence of a failure. In part 1 of this study presented in this paper, we formulated integer linear programs to determine the capacity requirements for the above protection schemes for a static traffic demand.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'744-751 vol.2', u'year': u'1999', u'keywords': u'wavelength division multiplexing;telecommunication network reliability;optical fibre networks;telecommunication network routing;integer programming;linear programming;WDM mesh networks;survivable optical networks;wavelength cross-connects;wavelength-division-multiplexed channels;network element failure;single-link failures;survivability paradigms;path protection/restoration;link protection/restoration;backup paths;integer linear programs;capacity requirements;static traffic demand;Wavelength division multiplexing;WDM networks;Mesh networks;Protection;Optical wavelength conversion;Optical network units;Optical packet switching;Optical fiber networks;Protocols;Optical interconnections', 'ID': u'751461', u'booktitle': u"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

A wavelength-routed wide area backbone network supporting circuit-switched traffic is considered. This paper also considers the use of optical wavelength conversion technology which has been shown to help improve network performance. However, wavelength conversion is still an expensive technology and using optical conversion could potentially result in signal quality degradation. In survivable networks, protection against failures is provided using backup paths that are determined when a session is established. In this paper, we present three primary and backup route computation mechanisms that attempt to improve overall network performance compared to existing solutions. One of the key design goals is to reduce the number of required converters per node. First, we present a routing algorithm, termed conversion free primary routing (CFPR) that computes primary paths without wavelength conversion, as far as possible. Next, we present a converter multiplexing technique that is used to share wavelength converters among multiple backup paths. This significantly reduces the number of connections blocked due to wavelength converter unavailability and reduces the number of wavelength converters required at each node, thus reducing system cost. Finally, we propose a backup path relocation scheme that migrates existing backup paths, whenever needed, to accommodate more primary paths and also to obtain primary routes with fewer hops. This is done to improve network utilization and reduce blocking probability. The proposed techniques are analyzed in detail using a discrete-event simulation model. The results show that significant reduction in blocking probability is possible with the proposed mechanisms. The number of converters required at each node to achieve a given blocking probability is also seen to be four times lower, compared to existing architectures based on static shortest path routing.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'1', u'pages': u'12-21 vol.1', u'year': u'2003', u'keywords': u'wavelength division multiplexing;optical fibre networks;optical wavelength conversion;circuit switching;discrete event systems;discrete event simulation;telecommunication network reliability;wavelength division multiplexing;optical WDM network protection mechanism;wavelength converter multiplexing;backup path relocation technique;circuit-switched traffic;network performance improvement;optical wavelength conversion technology;signal quality degradation;survivable network;backup route computation mechanism;routing algorithm;conversion free primary routing;CFPR;blocking probability reduction;discrete-event simulation model;static shortest path routing;wide area backbone network;network utilization;WDM networks;Protection;Optical fiber networks;Optical wavelength conversion;Wavelength division multiplexing;Wavelength conversion;Wavelength routing;Optical design;Spine;Circuits', 'ID': u'1208654', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2003.

Typical approaches of providing survivability have considered the failure of a single component such as a link or a node. We consider a failure model in which any two links in the network may fail in an arbitrary order. Three loopback methods of recovering from double-link failures are presented. The first two methods require the identification of the failed links, while the third one does not. However, precomputing the backup paths for the third method is more difficult than for the first two. A heuristic algorithm that pre-computes backup paths for links is presented. Numerical results comparing the performance of our algorithm with other approaches suggests that it is possible to achieve 100% recovery from double-link failures with a modest increase in backup capacity.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'June', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'808-816 vol.2', u'year': u'2002', u'keywords': u'wavelength division multiplexing;optical fibre networks;telecommunication network reliability;double-link failure recovery;WDM optical networks;network survivability;failure model;loopback methods;failed links identification;backup paths;heuristic algorithm;backup capacity;wavelength division multiplexing;Intelligent networks;Wavelength division multiplexing;WDM networks;Optical fiber networks;Protection;High speed optical techniques;Switches;Routing;Circuit faults;Optical fiber devices', 'ID': u'1019327', u'booktitle': u'Proceedings.Twenty-First Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies'}

Typically, there are two request models widely considered. In one model, a connection request asks to go from a wavelength on an input finer of the WDM switch to a particular wavelength on an output fiber. In the other, a connection only needs to get to a particular output fiber, irrespective of what wavelength it will be on. We give novel constructions of strictly nonblocking and rearrangeably nonblocking WDM switches for both request models using limited range wavelength converters and arrayed waveguide grating routers. We fully analyze their blocking characteristics. Our designs are all relatively simple and easy to be laid out, and are useful for both optical circuit-switching and optical packet/burst switching.

The paper attempts to enumerate the architectural options provided by SONET to arrive at a cost-effective solution, including unidirectional path-switched rings (UPSR) and bidirectional line-switched rings (BLSR), use of back-to-back connections between SONET ADMs to reduce the overall cost, and use of different ring speeds (OC-48 and OC-12). To demonstrate each of the architectures, a uniform traffic is considered and its grooming and resulting SONET architecture demonstrated. The paper deviates from earlier approaches which break the problem into two steps: traffic grooming and assignment of lightpaths to rings, in that it looks at the problem as a whole and tries to solve it in a single step. The paper also considers the characteristics of SONET UPSR and BLSR rings and how these affect the grooming.
