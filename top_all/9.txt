It generalizes the existing literature by introducing combinatorial auctions of heterogeneous VMs, and models dynamic VM provisioning. Social welfare maximization under dynamic resource provisioning is proven NP-hard, and modeled with a linear integer program. An efficient \u03b1-approximation algorithm is designed, with \u03b1 ~ 2.72 in typical scenarios. We then employ this algorithm as a building block for designing a randomized combinatorial auction that is computationally efficient, truthful in expectation, and guarantees the same social welfare approximation factor \u03b1. A key technique in the design is to utilize a pair of tailored primal and dual LPs for exploiting the underlying packing structure of the social welfare maximization problem, to decompose its fractional solution into a convex combination of integral solutions.

Fan', u'title': u'Fast optimal nonconcave resource allocation', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Efficient use of shared resources is a key problem in a wide range of computer systems, from cloud computing to multicore processors. Optimized allocation of resources among users can result in dramatically improved overall system performance. Resource allocation is in general NP-complete, and past works have mostly focused on studying concave performance curves, applying heuristics to nonconcave curves, or finding optimal solutions using slow dynamic programming methods. These approaches have drawbacks in terms of generality, accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we observe that realistic performance curves are often not concave, but rather can be broken into a small number of concave or convex segments. We present efficient algorithms for optimal and approximately optimal resource allocation leveraging this idea. We also introduce several algorithmic techniques that may be of independent interest. Our optimal algorithm runs in O(sn\u03b1(m)m(log m)2) time, and our approximation algorithm finds a 1 - \u03b5 optimal allocation for any \u03b5 > 0 in O(s/\u03b5 \u03b1(n/\u03b5)n2log n/\u03b5 log m) time; here, s is the number of segments, n the number of processes, m the amount of shared resource, and \u03b1 is the inverse Ackermann function that is \u2264 4 in practice. Existing exact and approximation algorithms have O(nm2) and O(n2m/\u03b5) running times, resp., so our algorithms are much faster in the practical case where n <;<; m. Experiments show that our algorithms are 215 times faster than dynamic programming for finding optimal solutions when m = 1M, and produce solutions with 33% better performance than greedy algorithms.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1508-1516', u'year': u'2015', u'keywords': u'cloud computing;computational complexity;dynamic programming;multiprocessing systems;resource allocation;storage allocation;optimal nonconcave resource allocation;cloud computing;multicore processor;NP-complete problem;concave performance curve;dynamic programming method;realistic performance curve;O(sn\u03b1(m)m(log m)2) time;O(s/\u03b5 \u03b1(n/\u03b5)n2log n/\u03b5 log m) time;inverse Ackermann function;O(nm2) running time;O(n2m/\u03b5) running time;Resource management;Approximation algorithms;Throughput;Heuristic algorithms;Approximation methods;Dynamic programming;Computers;Resource allocation;optimization;approximation algorithms', 'ID': u'7218529', u'booktitle': u'2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)'}

Public clouds nowadays provide more and more elaborated types of VMs, but have yet to offer the most flexible dynamic VM assembly, which is partly due to the lack of a mature mechanism for pricing tailor-made VMs on the spot. This work proposes an efficient randomized auction mechanism based on a novel application of smoothed analysis and randomized reduction, for dynamic VM provisioning and pricing in geo-distributed cloud data centers. This auction, to the best of our knowledge, is the first one in literature that achieves (i) truthfulness in expectation, (ii) polynomial running time in expectation, and (iii) (1 - \u03f5)-optimal social welfare in expectation for resource allocation, where \u03f5 can be arbitrarily close to 0. Our mechanism consists of three modules: (1) an exact algorithm to solve the NP-hard social welfare maximization problem, which runs in polynomial time in expectation, (2) a perturbation-based randomized resource allocation scheme which produces a VM provisioning solution that is (1 - \u03f5)-optimal and (3) an auction mechanism that applies the perturbation-based scheme for dynamic VM provisioning and prices the customized VMs using a randomized VCG payment, with a guarantee in truthfulness in expectation.

The cost is one of the major concerns for the cloud providers. In addition to the cost caused by network traffics (N-cost), the cost caused by the utilization of physical machines (PM-cost) is also non-negligible. In this paper, we focus on the optimized placement of VMs to minimize the cost, the combination of N-cost and PM-cost. We define N-cost by various functions, according to different communication models. We formulate the placement problem, and prove it to be NP-hard. We investigate the problem from two aspects. Firstly, we put a special emphasis on minimizing the N-cost with fixed PM-cost. For the case that tenants request the same amount of VMs, we present optimal algorithms under various definitions of N-cost. For the case that tenants require different numbers of VMs, we propose an approximation algorithm. Also, a greedy algorithm is implemented as the baseline to evaluate the performance. Secondly, we study the general case of the VM placement problem, in which both N-cost and PM-cost are taken into account. We present an effective binary-search-based algorithm to determine how many PMs should be used, which makes a tradeoff between PM-cost and N-cost.
