Liu', u'title': u'Sleep in the Dins: Insomnia therapy for duty-cycled sensor networks', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Duty cycling mode is widely adopted in wireless sensor networks to save energy. Existing duty-cycling protocols cannot well adapt to different data rates and dynamics, resulting in a high energy consumption in real networks. Improving those protocols may require global information or heavy computation and thus may not be practical, leading to empirical parameters in real protocols. To fill the gap between the application requirement and protocol performance, we design a light-weight adaptive duty-cycling protocol (LAD), which reduces the energy consumption under different data rates and protocol dynamics. We theoretically validate the performance improvement of the protocol. We implement the protocol in TinyOS and extensively evaluate it on 40 TelosB nodes. The evaluation results show the energy consumption can be reduced by 28.2%~40.1% compared with state-of-the-art protocols. Results based on data from a 1200-node operational network further show the effectiveness and scalability of the design.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1186-1194', u'year': u'2014', u'keywords': u'protocols;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks;insomnia therapy;duty cycling mode;wireless sensor networks;lightweight adaptive duty cycling protocol;LAD;energy consumption reduction;protocol dynamics;TinyOS;TelosB nodes;Protocols;Energy consumption;Receivers;Switching circuits;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Conferences', 'ID': u'6848050', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications'}

However, existing synchronization protocols based on wireless packet transmissions are not energy efficient because powering the radio often consumes a significant fraction of the energy budget. In this paper, we propose PSync, a visible light-based time synchronization protocol that relies on an LED light source and is highly energy efficient for the receivers. The key novelty in our protocol is the use of a De Bruijn sequence to provide a rough estimate of time using a minimum amount of information. Experiments show that our scheme achieves an average synchronization error of 1.3 timer ticks (32 \u03bcs per clock tick). In addition, the additional energy consumed for one round of synchronization based on PSync can be as low as 19% of the energy needed to receive a small packet (1 byte) using IEEE 802.15.4 radio.', u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2016', u'keywords': u'free-space optical communication;Internet of Things;light emitting diodes;protocols;PSync;visible light;Internet of Things;IoT;robust collaborative services;synchronization protocols;wireless packet transmissions;energy budget;time synchronization protocol;LED light source;De Bruijn sequence;Synchronization;Receivers;Sensors;Light emitting diodes;Light sources;Media Access Protocol', 'ID': u'7524358', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}

In PW-MAC, nodes each wake up to receive at randomized, asynchronous times. PW-MAC minimizes sensor node energy consumption by enabling senders to predict receiver wakeup times; to enable accurate predictions, PW-MAC introduces an on-demand prediction error correction mechanism that effectively addresses timing challenges such as unpredictable hardware and operating system delays and clock drift. PW-MAC also introduces an efficient prediction-based retransmission mechanism to achieve high energy efficiency even when wireless collisions occur and packets must be retransmitted. We evaluate PW-MAC on a testbed of MICAz motes and compare it to X-MAC, WiseMAC, and RI-MAC, three previous energy-efficient MAC protocols, under multiple concurrent multihop traffic flows and under hidden-terminal scenarios and scenarios in which nodes have wakeup schedule conflicts. In all experiments, PW-MAC significantly outperformed these other protocols. For example, evaluated on scenarios with 15 concurrent transceivers in the network, the average sender duty cycle for X-MAC, WiseMAC, and RI-MAC were all over 66%, while PW-MAC's average sender duty cycle was only 11%; the delivery latency for PW-MAC in these scenarios was less than 5% that for WiseMAC and X-MAC.

Existing solutions mainly rely on timestamp exchanges to estimate clock offset and skew, which results in frequent synchronization, high overhead, and high energy consumption to maintain a well-synchronized network. This paper introduces a novel clock syntonization approach to estimate the differences between clock frequencies of network nodes without the need for timestamp exchanges. The carrier frequency offset (CFO) assisted syntonization (CFOSynt) utilizes the carrier information obtained from wireless packet transmission for clock skew compensation. The key idea of CFOSynt is that, in any wireless communication system, where carrier modulation is employed, carrier frequency delivers information about the transmitter RF clock. Consequently, clock frequency offset between a pair of sensor nodes will result in a carrier frequency offset detected by the receiver node. By leveraging the CFO information, CFOSynt can estimate the system clock skew based on digital counter theory.
