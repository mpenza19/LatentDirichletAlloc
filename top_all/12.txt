To this end, we analyze user subscription dynamics and revenue maximization in monopoly and duopoly communications markets. First, by considering a monopoly market with only one NSP, we investigate the impact of technologies on the users' dynamic subscription. It is shown that, for any price charged by the NSP, there exists a unique equilibrium point of the considered user subscription dynamics. We also provide a sufficient condition under which the user subscription dynamics converges to the equilibrium point starting from any initial point. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal price and market share that maximize the NSP's revenue. Next, we turn to the analysis of a duopoly market and show that, for any charged prices, the equilibrium point of the considered user subscription dynamics exists and is unique. As in a monopoly market, we derive a sufficient condition on the technologies of the NSPs that ensures the user subscription dynamics to reach the equilibrium point. Then, we model the NSP competition using a non-cooperative game, in which the two NSPs choose their market shares independently, and provide a sufficient condition that guarantees the existence of at least one pure Nash equilibrium in the market competition game.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'2696-2704', u'year': u'2011', u'keywords': u'game theory;monopoly;telecommunication industry;user subscription dynamics;revenue maximization;network service providers;monopoly communications markets;duopoly communications markets;noncooperative game;Nash equilibrium;market competition game;Quality of service;Subscriptions;Monopoly;Cost accounting;Convergence;Games;Degradation', 'ID': u'5935099', u'booktitle': u'2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

The well-known Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism provides an elegant solution to this incentive issue. In particular, VCG implements the socially optimal outcome in dominant strategies. However, it is also well-known that this mechanism can require an excessive amount of communication. Approaches have been studied that relax the communication requirements while also relaxing the incentive guarantees to use Nash equilibria instead of dominant strategies. Here, we take a different approach and study mechanisms with limited information that still have dominant strategy outcomes, but suffer an efficiency loss. We characterize this loss for the case of a single divisible resource. We first consider a mechanism in which information is limited by quantizing the resource into a finite number of units and allocating each of these to one agent via a VCG mechanism. This limits each agent to submitting a finite number of real values. We subsequently consider the case where each value is also quantized before being reported by each agent.

We model this noncooperative interaction between an \u201ceyeball\u201d ISP and a \u201ccontent\u201d ISP as a Stackelberg game and quantify the resulting loss in social profit. To recover the profit loss, we propose a revenue sharing contract between ISPs by modeling them as a supply chain to deliver traffic in a two-sided market. Parameterized by the profit division factor, the sharing contract coordinates ISPs' objectives such that they aim to maximize the social profit self-incentively. We further propose a Nash bargaining process to determine the profit division factor such that all ISPs are simultaneously better off compared to the noncooperative equilibrium.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'596-600', u'year': u'2011', u'keywords': u'incentive schemes;industrial economics;revenue sharing;ISP;two-sided markets;rate allocation;network connectivity;profit division factor;Contracts;Games;Pricing;Resource management;NIST;Elasticity;Economics', 'ID': u'5935234', u'booktitle': u'2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}
