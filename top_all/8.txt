Still today this revolution is far from being complete, since the majority of telephone calls are originated by circuit-oriented networks. In this paper for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we present a large dataset of measurements collected from the FastWeb backbone, which is one of the first worldwide Telecom operator to offer VoIP and high-speed data access to the end-user. Traffic characterization will focus on several layers, focusing on both end-user and ISP perspective. In particular, we highlight that, among loss, delay and jitter, only the first index may affect the VoIP call quality.

Our objective is to assess to what extent today's Internet meets this expectation. Our assessment is based on delay and loss measurements taken over wide-area backbone networks, considers realistic VoIP scenarios and uses quality measures appropriate for voice. Our findings indicate that although voice services can be adequately provided by some ISPs, a significant number of paths lead to poor performance even for excellent VoIP end-systems. This makes a strong case for special handling of voice traffic on those paths. Even on the good paths, rare loss events can occasionally cause perceptible degradation of voice quality.

This clearly has negative consequences for the residents of Africa, but also has implications for organisations designing future networked technologies that might see deployment in the region. This paper presents a measurement campaign methodology to explore the current state of the African Internet. Using vantage points across the continent, we perform the first large-scale mapping of inter-country delays in Africa. Our analysis reveals a number of clusters, where countries have built up low delay interconnectivity, dispelling the myth that intra-communications in Africa are universally poor. Unfortunately, this does not extend to the remainder of the continent, which typically suffers from excessively high delays, often exceeding 300ms. We find that in many cases it is faster to reach European or North American networks that those in other regions of Africa. By mapping the internetwork topology, we identify a number of shortcomings in the infrastructure, most notably an excessive reliance on intercontinental transit providers.', u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'2231-2239', u'year': u'2018', u'keywords': u'Internet;internetworking;telecommunication network topology;measurement campaign methodology;African Internet;networked technologies;Africa intercountry latencies;intercountry delays;large-scale mapping;delay interconnectivity;internetwork topology;Africa;Delays;Probes;Servers;Internet;Topology', 'ID': u'8486024', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications'}
