Xu', u'title': u'T-Update: A tree-structured update scheme with top-down transmission in erasure-coded systems', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Erasure coding has received considerable attention due to the better tradeoff between the space efficiency and reliability. However, it consumes large network traffic and long time to complete the update, involving updates of both data nodes and parity nodes. Existing solutions to this problem mainly focus on proposing new class of codes with lower update complexity to reduce the network traffic, ignoring the optimization of data transmission structure. In fact, the data transmission structure has great impact on the update. In this paper, we propose T-Update, a tree-structured update scheme with top-down transmission that minimizes the update time for erasure-coded data with no additional network traffic. Specially, we propose a rack-aware tree construction technique to construct an update tree to organize the data connections, with the data node as the root and the parity nodes as the children. To maximize the update efficiency, we propose a top-down data transmission technique to guide the data transmission and distribute the data computation for updating the parity nodes. To evaluate the performance of T-Update, we conduct experiments on HDFS-RAID under various parameter settings on both 30 physical and 200 virtual servers. Extensive experiments confirm that T-Update reduces the update time by 27% and 32% on average compared with two typical update schemes respectively.', u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2016', u'keywords': u'storage management;tree data structures;trees (mathematics);T-Update;tree-structured update scheme;top-down transmission;erasure-coded system;erasure coding;data node update;parity node update;data transmission structure;distributed storage system;Data communication;Maintenance engineering;Encoding;Reliability;Distributed databases;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Distributed Storage System;Data Update;Update Tree;Erasure Codes', 'ID': u'7524347', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}

Markopoulou', u'title': u'Spectral Graph Forge: Graph Generation Targeting Modularity', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Community structure is an important property that captures inhomogeneities common in large networks, and modularity is one of the most widely used metrics for such community structure. In this paper, we introduce a principled methodology, the Spectral Graph Forge, for generating random graphs that preserves community structure from a real network of interest, in terms of modularity. Our approach leverages the fact that the spectral structure of matrix representations of a graph encodes global information about community structure. The Spectral Graph Forge uses a low-rank approximation of the modularity matrix to generate synthetic graphs that match a target modularity within user-selectable degree of accuracy, while allowing other aspects of structure to vary. We show that the Spectral Graph Forge outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy in targeting the modularity and randomness of the realizations, while also preserving other local structural properties and node attributes. We discuss extensions of the Spectral Graph Forge to target other properties beyond modularity, and its applications to anonymization.', u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1727-1735', u'year': u'2018', u'keywords': u'approximation theory;graph theory;matrix algebra;network theory (graphs);Spectral Graph Forge;community structure;random graphs;Graph generation;matrix representations;low-rank approximation;modularity matrix;synthetic graph generation;Matrix decomposition;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Symmetric matrices;Measurement;Conferences;Social network services;Topology', 'ID': u'8485916', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications'}

Li', u'title': u'Space-code bloom filter for efficient per-flow traffic measurement', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Per-flow traffic measurement is critical for usage accounting, traffic engineering, and anomaly detection. Previous methodologies are either based on random sampling (e.g., Cisco\'s NetFlow), which is inaccurate, or only account for the "elephants". We introduce a novel technique for measuring per-flow traffic approximately, for all flows regardless of their sizes, at very high-speed (say, OC768). The core of this technique is a novel data structure called space code bloom filter (SCBF). A SCBF is an approximate representation of a multiset; each element in this multiset is a traffic flow and its multiplicity is the number of packets in the flow. The multiplicity of an element in the multiset represented by SCBF can be estimated through either of two mechanisms-maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or mean value estimation (MVE). Through parameter tuning, SCBF allows for graceful tradeoff between measurement accuracy and computational and storage complexity. SCBF also contributes to the foundation of data streaming by introducing a new paradigm called blind streaming. We evaluate the performance of SCBF through mathematical analysis and through experiments on packet traces gathered from a tier-1 ISP backbone. Our results demonstrate that SCBF achieves reasonable measurement accuracy with very low storage and computational complexity', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'3', u'pages': u'1762-1773 vol.3', u'year': u'2004', u'keywords': u'data structures;filtering theory;Internet;maximum likelihood estimation;sampling methods;telecommunication traffic;space-code bloom filter;per-flow traffic measurement;random sampling;data structure;multiset;maximum likelihood estimation;mean value estimation;parameter tuning;blind streaming;tier-1 ISP backbone;Filters;Telecommunication traffic;Data structures;Random access memory;Space technology;Sampling methods;Fluid flow measurement;State estimation;Maximum likelihood estimation;Spine', 'ID': u'1354587', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2004'}

The key idea of our generalization is to characterize a network (graph) by a bivariate distribution that specifies the probability of the two vertices appearing at both ends of a randomly selected path in the graph. With such a bivariate distribution, we give a probabilistic definition of a community and a definition of a modularity index. To detect communities in a network, we propose a class of distribution-based clustering algorithms that have comparable computational complexity to that of Newman's fast algorithm. Our generalization provides the additional freedom to choose a bivariate distribution and a correlation measure. As such, we obtain significant performance improvement over the original Newman fast algorithm in the computer simulations of random graphs with known community structure.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'730-738', u'year': u'2011', u'keywords': u'computational complexity;computer networks;graph theory;pattern clustering;general probabilistic framework;community structure;Newman fast algorithm;bivariate distribution;graph theory;modularity index;distribution-based clustering algorithm;computational complexity;correlation measure;random graphs;large complex networks;graph partitioning;clustering algorithms', 'ID': u'5935256', u'booktitle': u'2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

A common technique used to improve the performance of data access is caching. Cooperative caching, which allows the sharing and coordination of cached data among multiple nodes, can further explore the potential of the caching techniques. Due to mobility and resource constraints of ad hoc networks, cooperative caching techniques designed for wired network may not be applicable to ad hoc networks. In this paper, we design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques to efficiently support data access in ad hoc networks. We first propose two schemes: cachedata which caches the data, and cachepath which caches the data path. After analyzing the performance of those two schemes, we propose a hybrid approach (hybridcache) which can further improve the performance by taking advantage of cachedata and cachepath while avoiding their weaknesses. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the query delay and message complexity when compared to other caching schemes.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'4', u'pages': u'2537-2547 vol.4', u'year': u'2004', u'keywords': u'ad hoc networks;information retrieval;cache storage;queueing theory;communication complexity;cooperative caching;ad hoc network;data access;cachedata;cachepath;data path;hybridcache;query delay;message complexity;Cooperative caching;Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Bandwidth;Delay;Computer science;Data engineering;Electronic mail;Performance analysis;Mobile ad hoc networks', 'ID': u'1354674', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2004'}

We use a simple output queue model to separate those delay components. Our step-by-step methodology used to ohtain the pure queueing delay is easily applicable to any single-hop delay measurements. After obtaining the queueing delay, we analyze the tail of its distribution, and find that it is long tailed and fits a Weihull distrihution with the scale parameter, a = 0.5, and the shape parameter, b = 0.58 to 0.6. The measured average queueing delay is larger than predicted by M/M/l, M/G/l, and FBM models when the link utilization is below 70%, but its absolute value is quite small.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'June', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'535-544', u'year': u'2002', u'keywords': u'Spine;Delay;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Moon;Queueing analysis;Particle measurements;Time measurement;IP networks;Tail', 'ID': u'1019298', u'booktitle': u'Proceedings.Twenty-First Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies'}
