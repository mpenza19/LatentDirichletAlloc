Hou', u'title': u'LT codes-based secure and reliable cloud storage service', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'With the increasing adoption of cloud computing for data storage, assuring data service reliability, in terms of data correctness and availability, has been outstanding. While redundancy can be added into the data for reliability, the problem becomes challenging in the \u201cpay-as-you-use\u201d cloud paradigm where we always want to efficiently resolve it for both corruption detection and data repair. Prior distributed storage systems based on erasure codes or network coding techniques have either high decoding computational cost for data users, or too much burden of data repair and being online for data owners. In this paper, we design a secure cloud storage service which addresses the reliability issue with near-optimal overall performance. By allowing a third party to perform the public integrity verification, data owners are significantly released from the onerous work of periodically checking data integrity. To completely free the data owner from the burden of being online after data outsourcing, this paper proposes an exact repair solution so that no metadata needs to be generated on the fly for repaired data. The performance analysis and experimental results show that our designed service has comparable storage and communication cost, but much less computational cost during data retrieval than erasure codes-based storage solutions. It introduces less storage cost, much faster data retrieval, and comparable communication cost comparing to network coding-based distributed storage systems.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'693-701', u'year': u'2012', u'keywords': u'cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;storage management;LT codes;cloud storage service security;cloud storage service reliability;cloud computing;data storage;data service reliability;data correctness;data availability;pay-as-you-use cloud paradigm;corruption detection;data repair;erasure codes;near-optimal overall performance;public integrity verification;data integrity;network coding-based distributed storage systems;Servers;Maintenance engineering;Cloud computing;Encoding;Decoding;Reliability;Distributed databases', 'ID': u'6195814', u'booktitle': u'2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

Towsley and Benyuan Liu and Zhen Liu', u'title': u'Properties of random direction models', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'A number of mobility models have been proposed for the purpose of either analyzing or simulating the movement of users in a mobile wireless network. Two of the more popular are the random waypoint and the random direction models. The random waypoint model is physically appealing but difficult to understand. Although the random direction model is less appealing physically, it is much easier to understand. User speeds are easily calculated, unlike for the waypoint model, and, as we observe, user positions and directions are uniformly distributed. The contribution of this paper is to establish this last property for a rich class of random direction models that allow future movements to depend on past movements. To this end, we consider finite oneand two-dimensional spaces. We consider two variations, the random direction model with wrap around and with reflection. We establish a simple relationship between these two models and, for both, show that positions and directions are uniformly distributed for a class of Markov movement models regardless of initial position. In addition, we establish a sample path property for both models, namely that any piecewise linear movement applied to a user preserves the uniform distribution of position and direction provided that users were initially uniformly throughout the space with equal likelihood of being pointed in any direction.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'3', u'pages': u'1897-1907 vol. 3', u'year': u'2005', u'keywords': u'mobile radio;Markov processes;piecewise linear techniques;random direction model;mobile wireless network;random waypoint model;two-dimensional space;one-dimensional space;Markov movement model;path property;piecewise linear movement;Reflection;Piecewise linear techniques;Space exploration;Electronic mail;Analytical models;Wireless networks;Space stations', 'ID': u'1498468', u'booktitle': u'Proceedings IEEE 24th Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies.'}

Cooperative caching systems are more effective than independent caches due to the larger collective backing store that cooperation creates. One such system currently being developed at UCLA, adaptive Web caching (AWC), uses an application-level forwarding table to locate the nearest copy of a requested URL's contents. This paper describes one specific design in AWC, a simple URL table compression algorithm allowing efficient content information-sharing among neighboring caches. The compression algorithm is based on a hierarchical URL decomposition to aggregate URL sharing common prefixes and an incremental hashing function to minimize collisions between prefixes. The algorithm's collision rate is derived analytically and verified by five sets of Web trace data. The results demonstrate that the collision rate is bounded and has little impact on page fetching latency. Finally, this compression method is compared to the summary cache method.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'670-678 vol.2', u'year': u'2000', u'keywords': u'cache storage;information resources;data compression;telecommunication congestion control;minimisation;URL forwarding;URL compression;adaptive Web caching;overloads;WWW;cooperative caching systems;UCLA;application-level forwarding table;content information sharing;incremental hashing function;collision minimization;Web trace data;page fetching latency;Uniform resource locators;Web server;Algorithm design and analysis;Compression algorithms;Internet;Topology;Routing protocols;Cooperative caching;Aggregates;Delay', 'ID': u'832241', u'booktitle': u'Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

Recently, mobile crowdsourcing, which can leverage workers' data from smartphones for data aggregation and analysis, has attracted much attention. However, when the data volume is getting large, it becomes a difficult problem for a requester to aggregate and analyze the incoming data, especially when the requester is an ordinary smartphone user or a start-up company with limited storage and computation resources. Besides, workers are concerned about their identity and data privacy. To tackle these issues, we introduce a three-party architecture for mobile crowdsourcing, where the cloud is implemented between workers and requesters to ease the storage and computation burden of the resource-limited requester. Identity privacy and data privacy are also achieved. With our scheme, a requester is able to verify the correctness of computation results from the cloud. We also provide several aggregated statistics in our work, together with efficient data update methods. Extensive simulation shows both the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed solution.", u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2016', u'keywords': u'cloud computing;data aggregation;data analysis;data privacy;mobile computing;outsourcing;resource allocation;security of data;smart phones;software architecture;privacy-preserving data aggregation;privacy-preserving data analysis;cloud-assisted mobile crowdsourcing;smart phone;three-party architecture;resource-limited requester;identity privacy;data privacy;data update method;Cloud computing;Data privacy;Crowdsourcing;Smart phones;Mobile communication;Sensors;Mobile Crowdsourcing;Cloud Computing;Security and Privacy;Verifiable Computation', 'ID': u'7524547', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}
