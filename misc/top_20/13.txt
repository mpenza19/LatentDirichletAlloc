Li', u'title': u'Popularity-driven content caching', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'This paper presents a novel cache replacement method - Popularity-Driven Content Caching (PopCaching). PopCaching learns the popularity of content and uses it to determine which content it should store and which it should evict from the cache. Popularity is learned in an online fashion, requires no training phase and hence, it is more responsive to continuously changing trends of content popularity. We prove that the learning regret of PopCaching (i.e., the gap between the hit rate achieved by PopCaching and that by the optimal caching policy with hindsight) is sublinear in the number of content requests. Therefore, PopCaching converges fast and asymptotically achieves the optimal cache hit rate. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of PopCaching by applying it to a movie.douban.com dataset that contains over 38 million requests. Our results show significant cache hit rate lift compared to existing algorithms, and the improvements can exceed 40% when the cache capacity is limited. In addition, PopCaching has low complexity.', u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2016', u'keywords': u'learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);popularity driven content caching;PopCaching;cache replacement method;online fashion;content popularity;cache hit rate;movie.douban.com;Databases;Context;Forecasting;Training;Streaming media;Servers;Algorithm design and analysis', 'ID': u'7524381', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}

One specific scenario is Internet access from moving vehicles on the road as we are researching in the drive-thru Internet project. Using wireless LAN as a broadly available access technology leads to intermittent - largely unpredictable and usually short-lived - connectivity, yet providing high performance while available. To allow Internet applications to deal reasonably well with such intermittent connectivity patterns, we have introduced a supportive drive-thru architecture. A key component is a "session" protocol offering persistent end-to-end communications even in the presence of interruptions. In this paper, we present the design of the persistent connectivity management protocol (PCMP) and report on findings from our implementation.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'3', u'pages': u'1849-1862 vol. 3', u'year': u'2005', u'keywords': u'Internet;mobile radio;protocols;computer network management;mobile computing;disconnection-tolerant transport;drive-thru Internet;ad-hoc communication;wireless communication;mobile communication;end-to-end communication protocol;wireless LAN;connectivity pattern;session protocol;persistent connectivity management protocol;Internet;Access protocols;Mobile communication;Transport protocols;Road vehicles;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks;Performance loss;Wireless application protocol;Vehicle driving', 'ID': u'1498464', u'booktitle': u'Proceedings IEEE 24th Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies.'}

Users that generate content have a strong motivation to actively promote their content in order to achieve publicity, recognition or to simply spread their viewpoints, knowledge and creations. Existing content sharing mechanisms available to such users, such as in P2P file sharing, are pull-based, relegating the user to a passive role. To enable active participation from users, we propose Promoter, a framework that enhances P2P file sharing systems to support content promotion in addition to the available pull-based content search.

In these systems, time is divided into slots which are further sub-divided into minislots. From a scheduling perspective, eMBB resource allocations occur at slot boundaries, whereas to reduce latency URLLC traffic is pre-emptively overlapped at the minislot timescale, resulting in selective superposition/puncturing of eMBB allocations. This approach enables minimal URLLC latency at a potential rate loss to eMBB traffic. We study joint eMBB and URLLC schedulers for such systems, with the dual objectives of maximizing utility for eMBB traffic while satisfying instantaneous URLLC demands. For a linear rate loss model (loss to eMBB is linear in the amount of superposition/puncturing), we derive an optimal joint scheduler. Somewhat counter-intuitively, our results show that our dual objectives can be met by an iterative gradient scheduler for eMBB traffic that anticipates the expected loss from URLLC traffic, along with an URLLC demand scheduler that is oblivious to eMBB channel states, utility functions and allocations decisions of the eMBB scheduler.
