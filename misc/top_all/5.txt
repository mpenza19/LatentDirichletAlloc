We assign forward error correction (FEC) codes to each layer in the encoded bit-stream according to its importance. To this end, we develop a new distortion measure that quantifies the distortion in the reconstructed mesh when part of the bit-stream is lost. Experimental results with a collection of 3D meshes have been conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our solution.

A class of MDS codes, called minimum-storage regenerating (MSR) codes, has been designed to optimize bandwidth consumption when repairing one single failure. Compared with repairing failures individually, the cooperative repair of multiple failures can help to further save bandwidth consumption when multiple failures are being repaired. In this paper, we present a new construction of minimum-storage cooperative regenerating (MSCR) codes that repair two failures cooperatively and exactly. We show that given a valid instance of linear exact MSR codes, we are able to construct a corresponding repair procedure to repair any two failures cooperatively with optimal bandwidth consumption, i.e., to construct an instance of exact MSCR codes directly from exact MSR codes. With this connection, we are also able to repair any single failure exactly with MSCR codes.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'316-324', u'year': u'2014', u'keywords': u'codes;storage management;cooperative repair;minimum-storage regenerating codes;distributed storage systems;redundant data;MDS codes;MSR codes;minimum-storage cooperative regenerating codes;MSCR codes;optimal bandwidth consumption;Maintenance engineering;Bandwidth;Computers;Vectors;Conferences;Distributed databases;Encoding', 'ID': u'6847953', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications'}

After the theoretical bound for distributed storage was derived by the pioneer work of the regenerating code, Reed-Solomon code based regenerating codes were developed. The RS code based minimum storage regeneration code (RS-MSR) and the RS code based minimum bandwidth regeneration code (RS-MBR) can achieve the theoretical bounds on the MSR point and the MBR point respectively in code regeneration. They can also maintain the MDS property in code reconstruction. However, in the hostile network where the storage nodes can be compromised and the packets can be tampered with, the storage capacity of the network can be significantly affected. In this paper, we propose a Hermitian code based regenerating (H-MSR) code. We first prove that this code can achieve the theoretical MSR bound. We then propose data regeneration and reconstruction algorithms for the H-MSR code in both error-free network and hostile network. Theoretical evaluation shows that our proposed schemes can detect the erroneous decodings and correct more errors in the hostile network than the RS-MSR code with the same code rate. Our analysis also demonstrates that the proposed H-MSR code has a lower complexity than the RS-MSR code in both code regeneration and code reconstruction.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'307-315', u'year': u'2014', u'keywords': u'cloud computing;Reed-Solomon codes;storage management;MDS bound;distributed cloud storage;cloud computing framework;RS code based minimum storage regeneration code;RS-MSR;RS code based minimum bandwidth regeneration code;RS-MBR;MSR point;MBR point;code reconstruction;Hermitian code based regenerating code;H-MSR code;error-free network;hostile network;Reed-Solomon code;Bandwidth;Equations;Cloud computing;Encoding;Conferences;Computers;Distributed databases;regenerating code;Reed-Solomon code;error-correction;Hermitian code', 'ID': u'6847952', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications'}
