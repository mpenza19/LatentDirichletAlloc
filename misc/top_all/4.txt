However, traditional disk sensing model does not consider this intrinsic property of camera sensors. To this end, we propose a novel model called full-view coverage. An object is considered to be full-view covered if for any direction from 0 to 2\u03c0 (object's facing direction), there is always a sensor such that the object is within the sensor's range and more importantly the sensor's viewing direction is sufficiently close to the object's facing direction. With this model, we propose an efficient method for full-view coverage detection in any given camera sensor networks. We also derive a sufficient condition on the sensor density needed for full-view coverage in a random uniform deployment. Finally, we show a necessary and sufficient condition on the sensor density for full-view coverage in a triangular lattice based deployment.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1781-1789', u'year': u'2011', u'keywords': u'cameras;object detection;camera sensor networks;full-view coverage;disk sensing;object facing direction;sensor density;random uniform deployment;triangular lattice', 'ID': u'5934977', u'booktitle': u'2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

Song', u'title': u'Restricted coverage in wireless networks', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u"For wireless networks, coverage with different restrictions that can capture the practical requirements have received great research interests. We will study several restricted coverage problems. The first problem is aboutK-coverage, i.e., how to deploy wireless nodes such that each target is covered by at leastKwireless nodes. We study the problem restricted to linear-K-coverage where there is a line, all targets lie in one side of this line and all wireless nodes lie in the other side. Assume each wireless node is associated with a weight, the objective is to select a minimum weighted subset of nodes such that each target isK-covered. We propose a 3-approximation for this problem by exploring geometric properties. The second problem is calledK-road-coverage. Given a road map in a two-dimensional area which contains a set of paths and a set of wireless nodes, the locations of nodes can either be arbitrary or fixed, the objective is to select a minimum number of wireless nodes such that each path can beK-covered. We will reduce the problem toK-coverage and apply the algorithmic results forK-coverage to solve it. Another line of this work is to investigate a well-motivated problem called strongly dominating set, which is intrinsically related to coverage. Given a wireless networking system represented by a digraph G = (V, E\u20d7). Each wireless node u has a covering disk centering at u with its radius equal to the transmission range of u. We then draw a directed edge uv\u20d7 in G if u's corresponding covering disk contains v. A subset U \u2286 V of wireless nodes is a strongly dominating set if every wireless node in V \\ U has both an in-neighbor in U and an out-neighbor in U. The objective is to find a minimum size strongly dominating set. Our method can achieve an approximation factor of (2 + \u03b5).", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'558-564', u'year': u'2014', u'keywords': u'approximation theory;geometry;radio networks;restricted coverage problems;out-neighbor;in-neighbor;wireless networking system;road-coverage;geometric properties;3-approximation;linear-K-coverage;wireless nodes;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Polynomials;Conferences;Computers;Approximation methods;Approximation algorithms', 'ID': u'6847980', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications'}

In this paper, we aim to understand the theoretical limitations of data collection in terms of possible and achievable maximum capacity. Previously, the study of data collection capacity has only concentrated on large-scale random networks. However, in most of practical sensor applications, the sensor network is not deployed uniformly and the number of sensors may not be as huge as in theory. Therefore, it is necessary to study the capacity of data collection in an arbitrary network. In this paper, we derive the upper and constructive lower bounds for data collection capacity in arbitrary networks. The proposed data collection method can lead to order-optimal performance for any arbitrary sensor networks.

Since nodes may fail due to accidental damage or energy depletion, it is desirable to construct a fault tolerant CDS, which can be modeled as a k-connected m-fold dominating set ((k, m)-CDS for short). A subset of nodes C \u2286 V(G) is a (k, m)-CDS of G if every node in V(G)\\C is adjacent with at least m nodes in C and the subgraph of G induced by C is k-connected. In this paper, we present an approximation algorithm for the minimum (3, m)-CDS problem with m > 3, which has size at most \u03b3 times that of an optimal solution, where \u03b3 = \u03b1 + 8 + 21n(2\u03b1 - 6) for \u03b1 > 4 and \u03b3 = 3\u03b1 + 2 In 2 for \u03b1 <; 4, and \u03b1 is the approximation ratio for the minimum (2, m)-CDS problem.

We are interested in the coverage of the region and the connectivity of the network. We first show that the necessary and sufficient conditions for the random grid network to cover the unit square region as well as ensure that the active nodes are connected are of the form p(n)r2(n) ~ log(n)/n, where r(n) is the transmission radius of each node and p(n) is the probability that a node is "active" (not failed). This result indicates that, when n is large, even if each node is highly unreliable and the transmission power is small, we can still maintain connectivity with coverage. We also show that the diameter of the random grid (i.e., the maximum number of hops required to travel from any active node to another) is of the order \u221a{n/log(n)}. Finally, we derive a sufficient condition for connectivity of the active nodes (without necessarily having coverage).
