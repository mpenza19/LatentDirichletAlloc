We observe that for a majority of these traces, the (second-order) scaling exponents at small time scales (1 ms - 100 ms) are fairly close to 0.5, indicating that traffic fluctuations at these time scales are (nearly) uncorrelated. In addition, the traces manifest mostly monofractal behaviors at small time scales. The objective of the paper is to understand the potential causes or factors that influence the small-time scalings of Internet backbone traffic via empirical data analysis. We analyze the traffic composition of the traces along two dimensions - flow size and flow density. Our study uncovers dense flows (i.e., flows with bursts of densely clustered packets) as the correlation-causing factor in small time scales, and reveals that the traffic composition in terms of proportions of dense vs. sparse flows plays a major role in influencing the small-time scalings of aggregate traffic.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'3', u'pages': u'1826-1836 vol.3', u'year': u'2003', u'keywords': u'Internet;telecommunication traffic;small-time scaling behavior;Internet backbone traffic;OC3/12/48 links;tier-1 Internet service provider;empirical data analysis;traffic composition;flow classification;densely clustered packets;correlation-causing factor;sparse flows;Internet;Spine;Traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Communication system traffic control;Fluctuations;Data analysis;Moon;Aggregates;IP networks', 'ID': u'1209205', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2003.

In order to sustain their botnets and disguise their illegal actions, botnet owners are exhausting their strength to mimic legitimate cyber behavior to fly under the radar, e.g. flash crowd mimicking attacks on popular websites. It is an open and challenging problem: can we beat mimicking attacks or not? We use web browsing on popular websites as an example to explore the issue. In our previous work, we discovered that it is almost impossible to detect mimicking attacks from statistics if the number of active bots of a botnet is sufficient (no less than the number of active legitimate users). In this paper, we pointed out that it is usually hard for botnet owners to have sufficient number of active bots in practice. Therefore, we can discriminate mimicking attacks when the sufficient number condition is not met. We prove our claim theoretically and confirm it with simulations. Our findings can also be applied to a large number of other detection related cases.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'2851-2855', u'year': u'2012', u'keywords': u'information retrieval;online front-ends;security of data;Web sites;legitimate cyber behavior;flash crowd mimicking attacks;botnets;malicious activities;cyber space;illegal actions;Web sites;Web browsing;active bots;Ash;Browsers;Computer crime;Web pages;Detection algorithms;Internet;Gaussian distribution;mimicking attack;flash crowd attack;botnet;detection', 'ID': u'6195714', u'booktitle': u'2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

Traditional detection techniques become less effective in identifying bots that communicate via a P2P structure. In this paper, we present PeerClean, a novel system that detects P2P botnets in real time using only high-level features extracted from C&amp;C network flow traffic. PeerClean reliably distinguishes P2P bot-infected hosts from legitimate P2P hosts by jointly considering flow-level traffic statistics and network connection patterns. Instead of working on individual connections or hosts, PeerClean clusters hosts with similar flow traffic statistics into groups. It then extracts the collective and dynamic connection patterns of each group by leveraging a novel dynamic group behavior analysis. Comparing with the individual host-level connection patterns, the collective group patterns are more robust and differentiable. Multi-class classification models are then used to identify different types of bots based on the established patterns. To increase the detection probability, we further propose to train the model with average group behavior, but to explore the extreme group behavior for the detection. We evaluate PeerClean on real-world flow records from a campus network. Our evaluation shows that PeerClean is able to achieve high detection rates with few false positives.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'316-324', u'year': u'2015', u'keywords': u'command and control systems;feature extraction;invasive software;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing;probability;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic;high-level feature extraction;detection probability;multiclass classification model;network connection pattern;flow level traffic statistic;P2P bot-infected host;detection technique;C&C network flow traffic;command and control;P2P botnet;dynamic group behavior analysis;peer-to-peer botnet;PeerClean;Feature extraction;Peer-to-peer computing;Training;Robustness;Support vector machines;Conferences;Computers', 'ID': u'7218396', u'booktitle': u'2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)'}
