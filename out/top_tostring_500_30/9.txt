The need for secure data exchange within the public Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) environment is addressed by applying the IEEE 802.10 Secure Data Exchange (SDE) protocol. A result of this study has been the implementation of an efficient protection mechanism for information transfer over the public SMDS network, providing security against unauthorized disclosure, data modification, masquerading attacks, and unauthorized access to resources. A security and key management system, consisting of applications and protocols, has also been provided. This has been used for configuring security system attributes such as cryptographic keys, session keys, and security flags, and for the supervision of the SDE protocol and the maintenance of local secure management information bases.

Cross-domain password-based authenticated key exchange revisited. cryptographic protocols; public key cryptography; telecommunication security; cross-domain password-based authenticated key exchange; cross-domain secure communication; public key certificates; trusted certificate; domain authentication servers; long-term secret key; four-party password-based authenticated key exchange protocol; two-party password-based key exchange protocol; two-party asymmetric-key based key exchange protocol; Protocols; Servers; Public key; Authentication; Electronic mail; Materials; Password-based protocol; key exchange; cross-domain; client-to-client. We revisit the problem of cross-domain secure communication between two users belonging to different security domains within an open and distributed environment. Existing approaches presuppose that either the users are in possession of public key certificates issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA), or the associated domain authentication servers share a long-term secret key. In this paper, we propose a four-party password-based authenticated key exchange (4PAKE) protocol that takes a different approach from previous work. The users are not required to have public key certificates, but they simply reuse their login passwords they share with their respective domain authentication servers. On the other hand, the authentication servers, assumed to be part of a standard PKI, act as ephemeral CAs that “certify” some key materials that the users can subsequently exchange and agree on a session key. Moreover, we adopt a compositional approach. That is, by treating any secure two-party password-based key exchange protocol and two-party asymmetric-key based key exchange protocol as black boxes, we combine them to obtain a generic and provably secure 4PAKE protocol.

Checks and balances: A tripartite public key infrastructure for secure web-based connections. authorisation; certification; Internet; public key cryptography; balances; tripartite public key infrastructure; Certification Authorities; CAs; fraudulently issued certificates; notaries; independent party; record certificates; systematic mutual verification; party leaks; private key; Certificates Authorities; secure SSL/TLS; checks; single party compromise; collaborative certificate management scheme; security analysis; secure Web-based connections; Public key; Servers; Collaboration; Electronic mail; Conferences; Authentication; Public Key Infrastructure; DNS-based; Mutual Verification. Recent real-world attacks against Certification Authorities (CAs) and fraudulently issued certificates arouse the public to rethink the security of public key infrastructure for web-based connections. To distribute the trust of CAs, notaries, as an independent party, are introduced to record certificates, and a client can request an audit proof of certificates from notaries directly. However, there are two challenges. On one hand, existing works consider the security of notaries insufficiently. Due to lack of systematic mutual verification, notaries might bring safety bottlenecks. On the other hand, the service of these works is not sustainable, when any party leaks its private key or fails. In this paper, we propose a Tripartite Public Key Infrastructure (TriPKI), using Certificates Authorities, Integrity Log Servers, and Domain Name Servers, to provide a basis for establishing secure SSL/TLS connections. Specifically, we apply checks-and balances among those three parties in the structure to make them verify mutually, which avoids any single party compromise. Furthermore, we design a collaborative certificate management scheme to provide sustainable services. The security analysis and experiment results demonstrate that our scheme is suitable for practical usage with moderate overhead.

A authentication protocol with security imbedded into it is reported. It is based on a combination of the private-key and the public-key encryption systems. A Petri-net model of the protocol is presented to verify that the protocol is correct and deadlock-free.

Scalable, fine-grained access control for Internet-of-Things is needed in enterprise environments, where thousands of subjects need to access possibly one to two orders of magnitude more objects. Existing solutions offer all-or-nothing access, or require all access to go through a cloud backend, greatly impeding access granularity, robustness and scale. In this paper, we propose Heracles, an IoT access control system that achieves robust, fine-grained access control at enterprise scale. Heracles adopts a capability-based approach using secure, unforgeable tokens that describe the authorizations of subjects, to either individual or collections of objects in single or bulk operations. It has a 3-tier architecture to provide centralized policy and distributed execution desired in enterprise environments, and delegated operations for responsiveness of resource-constrained objects. Extensive security analysis and performance evaluation on a testbed prove that Heracles achieves robust, responsive, fine-Qrained access control in large scale enterprise environments.

We address the problem of trust establishment between wireless devices that do not share any prior secrets. This includes the mutual authentication and agreement to a common key that can be used to further bootstrap essential cryptographic mechanisms. We propose SFIRE, a secret-free trust establishment protocol that allows the secure pairing of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless devices with a hub. Compared to the state-of-the-art, SFIRE does not require any out-of-band channels, special hardware, or firmware modification, but can be applied to any COTS device. Moreover, SFIRE is resistant to the most advanced active signal manipulations that include recently demonstrated signal nullification at an intended receiver. These security properties are achieved in-band with the assistance of a helper device such as a smartphone and by using the RSS fluctuation patterns to build a robust “RSS authenticator”. We perform extensive experiments using COTS devices and USRP radios and verify the validity of the proposed protocol.

The author introduces a form of attack, a verifiable-test attack, in which an attacker obtains secret information, such as a password used in a protocol, without breaking the underlying cryptosystem. An investigation is made of the essence of a verifiable-text attack, and an algorithm for examining protocols and searching for vulnerabilities to such an attack is developed. Caution has to be exercised in certifying that a protocol is not vulnerable because a healthy protocol may become vulnerable when it interacts with another vulnerable or even healthy protocol.
