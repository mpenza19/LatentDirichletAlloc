High-Ievel programming and programmable data paths are two key capabilities of software-defined networking (SDN). A fundamental problem linking these two capabilities is whether a given high-level SDN program can be realized onto a given low-level SDN datapath structure. Considering all high-level programs that can be realized onto a given datapath as the programming capacity of the datapath, we refer to this problem as the SDN data path programming capacity problem. In this paper, we conduct the first study on the SDN datapath programming capacity problem, in the general setting of high-level, datapath oblivious, algorithmic SDN programs and state-of-art multi-table SDN data path pipelines. In particular, considering datapath-oblivious SDN programs as computations and datapath pipelines as computation capabilities, we introduce a novel framework called SDN characterization junctions, to map both SDN programs and datapaths into a unifying space, deriving the first rigorous result on SDN datapath programming capacity. We not only prove our results but also conduct realistic evaluations to demonstrate the tightness of our analysis.

Load Balancing Across Microservices. game theory; queueing theory; resource allocation; cloud container technology; shared microservices; message queue; microservice communications; chain-oriented load balancing algorithm; microservice requirements; microservice allocation; Load management; Time factors; Containers; Computer architecture; Load modeling; Conferences; Logic gates. With the advent of cloud container technology, enterprises develop applications through microservices, breaking monolithic software into a suite of small services whose instances run independently in containers. User requests are served by a series of microservices forming a chain, and the chains often share microservices. Existing load balancing strategies either incur significant networking overhead or ignore the competition for shared microservices across chains. Furthermore, typical load balancing solutions leverage a hybrid technique by combining HTTP with message queue to support microservice communications, bringing additional operational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a chain-oriented load balancing algorithm (COLBA) based solely on message queues, which balances load based on microservice requirements of chains to minimize response time. We model the load balancing problem as a non-cooperative game, and leverage Nash bargaining to coordinate microservice allocation across chains. Employing convex optimization with rounding, we efficiently solve the problem that is proven NP-hard. Extensive trace-driven simulations demonstrate that COLBA reduces the overall average response time at least by 13% compared with existing load balancing strategies.

Opportunistic Multichannel Access with Imperfect Observation: A Fixed Point Analysis on Indexability and Index-based Policy. cognitive radio; computational complexity; optimisation; wireless channels; Whittle index policy; channel state belief evolution; indexability; closed-form Whittle-index; multichannel access; imperfect observation; fixed point analysis; index-based policy; multichannel opportunistic access problem; time slot; multiple Gilbert-Elliot channels; channel access policies; traditional approach; restless bandits; problem hardness; PSPACE-Hard; restless multiarmed bandit problem; Indexes; Sensors; Optimization; Conferences; Nonlinear dynamical systems; History; Receivers; Restless bandit; Whittle index; indexability; fixed point; nonlinear operator. We consider the multichannel opportunistic access problem, in which a user decides, at each time slot, which channel to access among multiple Gilbert-Elliot channels in order to maximize his aggregated utility (e.g., the expected transmission throughput) given that the observation of channel state is error-prone. The problem can be cast into a restless multiarmed bandit problem which is proved to be PSPACE-Hard. An alternative approach, given the problem hardness, is to look for simple channel access policies. Whittle index policy is a very popular heuristic for restless bandits, which is provably optimal asymptotically and has good empirical performance. In the case of imperfect observation, the traditional approach of computing the Whittle index policy cannot be applied because the channel state belief evolution is no more linear, thus rendering the indexability of our problem open. In this paper, we mathematically establish the indexability and establish the closed-form Whittle-index, based on which index policy can be constructed. The major technique in our analysis is a fixed point based approach which enable us to divide the belief information space into a series of regions and then establish a set of periodic structures of the underlying nonlinear dynamic evolving system, based on which we devise the linearization scheme for each region to establish indexability and compute the Whittle index for each region.

Optimizing Network Reliability via Best-First Search over Decision Diagrams. binary decision diagrams; computational complexity; decision trees; optimisation; reliability; search problems; best-first search over decision diagrams; communication networks; reliability evaluation; network design problems; reliability maximization; cost minimization; search algorithm; cost-aware BDD heuristic function; network reliability optimization; binary decision diagram; optimal reliability; #P-complete; Boolean functions; Computer network reliability; Reliability engineering; Optimization; Reliability theory; Communication networks. Communication networks are an essential infrastructure and must be designed carefully to ensure high reliability. Identifying a fully reliable design is, however, computationally very tough since it requires that a reliability evaluation, which is known to be #P-complete, be repeated an exponential number of times. Existing studies, therefore, attempt to avoid exact optimization to reduce the computational burden by applying heuristics. Due to the importance of communication networks and to better assess the accuracy of heuristic approaches, exact optimization remains a key goal. This paper proposes an exact method for two network design problems: reliability maximization under budget constraints and cost minimization with assurance of reliability. Our method employs a common idea to solve these problems, i.e., a best-first search algorithm that runs on decision diagrams. Our method employs just a single binary decision diagram (BDD) to compute the reliability for any solution and is also used as the basis of a novel heuristic function, called the cost-aware BDD heuristic function, as a search guide. Numerical experiments show that our method scales well; it successfully optimizes a network with 189 links. In addition, our method reveals the poor performance of existing heuristic approaches; a well-known existing heuristic method is shown to yield a solution that offers less than half the optimal reliability.

An investigation to determine the minimum cost capacity expansion plan for the outside plant network to meet projected demand over a given planning horizon is presented. It is shown how the problem can be modeled as an integer programming problems; however, the size of the problem for a typical network precludes the use of a general-purpose integer programming code. A decomposition approach that takes advantage of the structure of the problem and allows the problem to be solved in a reasonable amount of time is proposed. The solution methods have been implemented and computational results are presented.

Optimal joint load balancing and routing in message switched computer networks. computer networks; optimisation; optimal joint load balancing; routing; message switched computer networks; optimization problem; average job response time; average message delay; Frank-Wolfe method; Load management; Routing; Intelligent networks; Computer networks; Lagrangian functions; Heuristic algorithms; Delay effects; Information systems; Dynamic programming; Computer errors. The load balancing and routing problems are combined as a single problem to capture the interaction between them. An optimization problem for joint load balancing and routing is formulated using a linear combination of the average job response time and average message delay as the performance criterion. Given an initial feasible solution, the Frank-Wolfe method is applied to solve the problem. An algorithm which gives an optimal solution is obtained. The algorithm is then extended to solve the same problem with multiple types of jobs.
