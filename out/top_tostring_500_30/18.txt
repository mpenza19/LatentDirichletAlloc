Today, 360-degree video streaming has become a popular Internet service with the rise of affordable virtual reality (VR) technologies. However, streaming 360-degree videos suffers from the prohibitive bandwidth demand. Existing bandwidth-efficient solutions mainly focus on exploiting the inherent spatial adaptability of 360-degree videos, delivering only video content (spatially-cut tiles) in the viewer's region of interest (ROI) with higher quality. Temporal adaptability, which has been widely leveraged in HTTP streaming, has not been well exploited to select proper quality for video segments according to the bandwidth variations. When these two dimensions of adaptability are jointly considered, bitrate selection for the tiles become more complicated and challenging. The importance of a tile with a spatial coordination played at a specific time should be quantified so that we can determine how to allocate bandwidth for improving the viewer's quality of experience. Furthermore, viewer's head orientation prediction is highly variable, which makes the determination of important tiles highly dynamic. In addition, network fluctuations are very common on the Internet. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bi-Adaptive Streaming for 360-degree videos (BAS-360°). In BAS-360°, both spatial and temporal adaptabilities are explored in the bitrate selection for different tiles. The objective is to minimize the bandwidth waste by allocating bandwidth to more important tiles (the tiles that are more likely to be watched). To tackle the high variability of visual region prediction and the unpredictable network fluctuations, we employ two features provided by HTT P /2: stream termination and stream priority, to efficiently organize tile delivery. Evaluation results show that BAS-360° outperforms naive tile-based 360-degree video streaming strategies when network fluctuations or errors in viewport predictions occur.

ClusTile: Toward Minimizing Bandwidth in 360-degree Video Streaming. image segmentation; integer programming; linear programming; pattern clustering; video signal processing; video streaming; ClusTile; 360-degree view; bandwidth minimization; tiling approach; 360-degree Video streaming systems; integer linear programs; 360-degree video segments; Streaming media; Bandwidth; Standards; Encoding; Bit rate; Conferences; Image segmentation. 360-degree video has the potential to transform the video streaming experience by providing a more-immersive environment for users to interact with than standard streaming video. This experience is hampered, however, by high bandwidth requirements resulting from the extra information associated with the 360-degree frames. Because users cannot see this full 360-degree view, but the full view is transmitted in the majority of 360-degree streaming systems, there is much potential to reduce wasted bandwidth in this domain. We propose ClusTile, a tiling approach formulated to select a set of tiles that allows minimal bandwidth needed to be used when streaming 360-degree video over an expected set of views. These tiles are selected by solving a set of integer linear programs (ILPs) independently on clusters of collected user views. The clustering approach reduces computation requirements of the ILPs to practical levels. Tilings computed from ClusTile can save up to 76% bandwidth compared to standard 360-degree streaming and up to 52% bandwidth compared to best-performing fixed tiling schemes.

With the proliferation of online video, measuring quality of experience (QoE) has become a pivotal aspect for the analysis of today's over-the-top (OTT) video streaming. To monitor video QoE, we introduce YouSlow that can detect various playback events (e.g., start-up latency, rebufferings and bitrate changes) from video players while a video is being played. Using YouSlow, we have collected more than 400,000 YouTube views from more than 100 countries. We measured the impact of these playback events on video abandonment and found that rebufferings incur abandonment rates six times higher than start-up latency, mostly caused by pre-roll ads. A single rebuffering event has three times the impact of a bitrate change. Even increasing the bitrate can raise abandonment rates by a factor of four compared to keeping the bitrate constant.

Multiview videos offer unprecedented experience by allowing users to explore scenes from different angles and perspectives. Thus, such videos have been gaining substantial interest from major content providers such as Google and Facebook. Adaptive streaming of multiview videos is, however, challenging because of the Internet dynamics and the diversity of user interests and network conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel rate adaptation algorithm for multiview videos (called MASH). Streaming multiview videos is more user centric than single-view videos, because it heavily depends on how users interact with the different views. To efficiently support this interactivity, MASH constructs probabilistic view switching models that capture the switching behavior of the user in the current session, as well as the aggregate switching behavior across all previous sessions of the same video. MASH then utilizes these models to dynamically assign relative importance to different views. Furthermore, MASH uses a new buffer-based approach to request video segments of various views at different qualities, such that the quality of the streamed videos is maximized while the network bandwidth is not wasted. We have implemented a multiview video player and integrated MASH in it. We compare MASH versus the state-of-the-art algorithm used by YouTube for streaming multiview videos. Our experimental results show that MASH can produce much higher and smoother quality than the algorithm used by YouTube, while it is more efficient in using the network bandwidth. In addition, we conduct large-scale experiments with up to 100 concurrent multiview streaming sessions, and we show that MASH maintains fairness across competing sessions, and it does not overload the streaming server.

Tracker-assisted rate adaptation for MPEG DASH live streaming. video coding; video streaming; tracker-assisted rate adaptation; MPEG DASH live streaming; adaptive video streaming; HTTP; adaptive bit-rate; throughput-based ABR; MPEG DASH architecture; tracker functionality; client-to-client sharing; tracker-assisted strategies; peer-to-peer streaming; Streaming media; Servers; Transform coding; Bandwidth; Encoding; Video coding; Oscillators. MPEG DASH is a widely used standard for adaptive video streaming over HTTP. The conceptual architecture for DASH includes a web server and clients, which download media segments from the server. Clients select the resolution of video segments by using an Adaptive Bit-Rate (ABR) strategy; in particular, a throughput-based ABR is used in the case of live video applications. However, recent papers show that these strategies may suffer from the presence of proxies/caches in the network, which are instrumental in streaming video on a large scale. To face this issue, we propose to extend the MPEG DASH architecture with a Tracker functionality, enabling client-to-client sharing of control information. This extension paves the way to a novel family of Tracker-assisted strategies that allow a greater design flexibility, while solving the specific issue caused by proxies/caches; in addition, its utility goes beyond the problem at hand, as it can be used by other applications as well, e.g. for peer-to-peer streaming.

A packet-loss resilient, bandwidth-scalable 3D graphics streaming system is proposed. It uses the compressed progressive mesh (CPM) algorithm (see Pajarola, R. and Rossignac, J., IEEE Trans. on Visualization and Computer Graphics, vol.6, no.1, p.79-93, 2000) to generate a hierarchical bit-stream to represent different levels of details (LODs). We assign forward error correction (FEC) codes to each layer in the encoded bit-stream according to its importance. To this end, we develop a new distortion measure that quantifies the distortion in the reconstructed mesh when part of the bit-stream is lost. Experimental results with a collection of 3D meshes have been conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our solution. They indicate that with our proposed unequal error protection (UEP), the decoded mesh quality degrades more gracefully, compared to either no error protection (NEP) or equal error protection (EEP) methods, as the packet loss rate increases.

This paper presents a study of the statistical characteristics and multiplexing of variable-bit-rate (VBR) MPEG-coded video streams. Our results are based on 23 minutes of video obtained from the entertainment movie, The Wizard of Oz. The experimental setup which was used to capture, digitize, and compress the video stream is described. Although the study is conducted at the frame level (as opposed to the slice level), it is observed that the inter-frame correlation structure for the frame-size sequence involves complicated forms of pseudo-periodicity that are mainly affected by the compression pattern of the sequence. A simple model for an MPEG traffic source is developed in which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the original captured video stream. The number of cells per frame is fitted by a lognormal distribution. Simulations are used to study the performance of an ATM multiplexer for MPEG streams.
