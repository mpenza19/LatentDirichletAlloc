Contracts as Investment Barriers in Unlicensed Spectrum. game theory; investment; investment barriers; unlicensed spectrum; expensive licenses; wireless services; entry barriers; customer contracts; game theoretic model; Contracts; Investment; Wireless communication; Switches; Liquids; Quality of service; Games. By not requiring expensive licenses, unlicensed spectrum lowers the barriers for firms to offer wireless services. However, incumbent firms may still try to erect other entry barriers. For example, recent work has highlighted how customer contracts may be used as one such barrier by penalizing customers for switching to a new entrant. However, this work did not account for another potential benefit of unlicensed spectrum, having access to this open resource may incentivize entrants to invest in new and potentially better technology. This paper studies the interaction of contracts and the incentives of firms to invest in developing new technology. We use a game theoretic model to study this and characterize the effect of contracts on economic welfare. The role of subsidies or taxes by a social planner is also considered.

The great potential of mobile crowdsourcing has started to attract attention of both industries and the research community. However, current commercial mobile crowdsourcing marketplaces are unsatisfactory because of the limited worker base and functionality. In this paper, we first revisit the foundation of performing mobile crowdsourcing on location-based social networks (LBSNs) through specially designed survey studies and comparison experiments involving hundreds of users. Our results reveal that active check-ins are good indicators of picking a right user to perform tasks, and LBSN could be an ideal platform for mobile crowdsourcing given proper services provided. We then propose both the centralized and decentralized design of MobiCrowd, a mobile crowdsourcing service built on LBSNs. Our evaluation, through trace-driven simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrates that the proposed schemes can effectively find workers for mobile crowdsourcing tasks associated with different venues by analyzing their location check-in histories.

The challenge is to develop an easily usable protocol development framework that combines the flexibility of layered implementations, the efficiency of tightly-coupled monolithic implementations and the correctness achievable using high-level protocol validation languages. This challenge is addressed by a language-based framework that introduces a new protocol specification language called Promela++. The framework consists of a protocol verification tool and an optimizing compiler that generates efficient protocol code from Promela++ specifications. Promela++ is based on the Promela protocol validation language and has been designed with a rich set of domain-specific constructs. These constructs facilitate the task of protocol specification as well as enable the Promela++ compiler to perform domain-specific optimizations. The Promela++ compiler can also automatically transform protocol specifications in Promela++ to protocol models in Promela. The article presents a new language that unites the twin goals of checking protocol correctness using model checkers, and efficient protocol construction using optimizing compilers, under a single framework; exploits language design to provide mechanisms that simultaneously ease programming and enable generation of efficient protocol code; and demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach by doing a complete evaluation of multiple protocol implementations in Promela++.

Caching popular content at the wireless edge is recently proposed as a means to reduce congestion at the backbone of cellular networks. The two main actors involved are Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and Content Providers (CPs). In this work, we consider the following arrangement: an MNO pre-installs memory on its wireless equipment (e.g. Base Stations) and invites a unique CP to use them, with monetary cost. The CP will lease memory space and place its content; the MNO will associate network users to stations. For a given association policy, the MNO may help (or not) the CP to offload traffic, depending on whether the association takes into account content placement. We formulate an optimization problem from the CP perspective, which aims at maximizing traffic offloading with minimum leasing costs. This is a joint optimization problem that can include any association policy, and can also derive the optimal one. We present a general exact solution using Benders decomposition. It iteratively updates decisions of the two actors separately and converges to the global optimum. We illustrate the optimal CP leasing/placement strategy and hit probability gains under different association policies. Performance is maximised when the MNO association follows CP actions.

Efficient and flexible crowdsourcing of specialized tasks with precedence constraints. constraint handling; customer satisfaction; task analysis; specialized tasks; precedence constraints; crowdsourcing systems; skill-sets; customer satisfaction; Crowdsourcing; Resource management; Companies; Computer science; Numerical models; Stochastic processes; Conferences. Many companies now use crowdsourcing to leverage external (as well as internal) crowds to perform specialized work, and so methods of improving efficiency are critical. Tasks in crowdsourcing systems with specialized work have multiple steps and each step requires multiple skills. Steps may have different flexibilities in terms of obtaining service from one or multiple agents, due to varying levels of dependency among parts of steps. Steps of a task may have precedence constraints among them. Moreover, there are variations in loads of different types of tasks requiring different skill-sets and availabilities of different types of agents with different skill-sets. Considering these constraints together necessitates the design of novel schemes to allocate steps to agents. In addition, large crowdsourcing systems require allocation schemes that are simple, fast, decentralized and offer customers (task requesters) the freedom to choose agents. In this work we study the performance limits of such crowdsourcing systems and propose efficient allocation schemes that provably meet the performance limits under these additional requirements. We demonstrate our algorithms on data from a crowdsourcing platform run by a non-profit company and show significant improvements over current practice.

Crowdsourcing of jobs to online freelance markets is rapidly gaining popularity. Most crowdsourcing platforms are uncontrolled and offer freedom to customers and freelancers to choose each other. This works well for unskilled jobs (e.g., image classification) with no specific quality requirement since freelancers are functionally identical. For skilled jobs (e.g., software development) with specific requirements, however, this does not ensure the maximum number of job requests is satisfied. In this work we determine the capacity of freelance markets, in terms of maximum satisfied job requests, and propose centralized schemes that achieve capacity. To ensure decentralized operation and freedom of choice for customers and freelancers, we propose simple schemes compatible with the operation of current crowd-sourcing platforms that approximately achieve capacity. Further, for settings where job requests exceed capacity, we propose an optimal and fair scheme for declining jobs without wait.

Recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed to achieve higher spectral efficiency over conventional orthogonal multiple access. Although it has the potential to meet increasing demands of video services, it is still challenging to provide high performance video streaming. In this research, we investigate, for the first time, a multi-user NOMA system design for video transmission. Various NOMA systems have been proposed for data transmission in terms of throughput or reliability. However, the perceived quality, or the quality-of-experience of users, is more critical for video transmission. Based on this observation, we design a quality-driven scalable video transmission framework with cross-layer support for multiuser NOMA. To enable low complexity multi-user NOMA operations, a novel user grouping strategy is proposed. The key features in the proposed framework include the integration of the quality model for encoded video with the physical layer model for NOMA transmission, and the formulation of multiuser NOMA-based video transmission as a quality-driven power allocation problem. As the problem is non-concave, a global optimal algorithm based on the hidden monotonic property and a suboptimal algorithm with polynomial time complexity are developed. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-user NOMA system outperforms existing schemes in various video delivery scenarios.
