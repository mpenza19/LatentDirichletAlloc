We provide an improved bound for the expectation of the stationary delay under the maximum weight scheduling (MWS) policy in one-hop wireless networks. In the model, the interference of the links is characterized by an interference graph G=(V, E). For a vector μ ϵ R|V|+, let χf(G, μ) be the weighted fractional coloring number for the graph G under the weight vector μ. For an arrival rate vector λ in the capacity region, we define a quantity ε(λ)to be the unique value satisfying the condition χf(G, λ+ε(λ)e) = 1, where e = (1, 1,..., 1)T. We show that the stationary delay is upper-bounded by B(2(Σi=1|V|λi) ε(λ)), where B is a constant depending on the arrival process. We show that the new bound is the tightest single-parameter bound obtainable with an often-used analytical framework. Generalizing the above, we also provide the tightest bounds for all MWS-w policies.

We consider the scenario where a source streams a flow at fixed rate to a receiver across a network, possibly using multiple paths. Transmission over a link incurs a delay modeled as a non-negative, non-decreasing and differentiable function of the link aggregated transmission rate. This setting models various practical network communication scenarios. We study network delay optimization concerning two popular metrics, namely maximum delay and average delay experienced by the flow. A well-known pessimistic result says that a flow cannot simultaneously achieve optimal maximum delay and optimal average delay, or even within constant-ratio gaps to the two optimums. In this paper, we pose an optimistic note on the fundamental compatibility of the two delay metrics. Specifically, we design two polynomial-time solutions to deliver (1 -ε) fraction of the flow with maximum delay and average delay simultaneously within 1/ε to the optimums for any ε ∈ (0,1). Hence, the two delay metrics are “largely” compatible. The ratio 1/ε is independent to the network size and link delay function, and we show that it is tight or near-tight. Simulations based on real-world continent-scale network topology verify our theoretical findings. Note that the proposed delay gap 1/ε, upon sacrificing ε fraction of the flow rate, is guaranteed even under the worst theoretical case setting. Our simulation results show that the empirical delay gaps observed under practical settings can be much smaller than 1/ε. Our results are of particular interest to delay-centric networking applications that can tolerate a small fraction of traffic loss, including cloud video conferencing that recently attracts substantial attention.

We study the general scaling laws of the capacity for random wireless networks under the generalized physical model. The generality of this work is embodied in three dimensions denoted by (λ ∈ [1, n], nd∈ [1, n], ns∈ (1, n]). It means that: (1) We study the random network of a general node density λ ∈ [1, n], rather than only study either random dense network (RDN, λ = n) or random extended network (REN, λ = 1) as in the literature. (2) We focus on the multicast capacity to unify unicast and broadcast capacities by setting the number of destinations for each session as a general value nd∈ [1, n]. (3)We allow the number of sessions changing in the range ns∈ (1, n], rather than assume that ns= Θ(n) as in the literature.We derive the general lower bounds on the capacity for the arbitrary case of (λ, nd, ns). Particularly, we show that for the special cases (λ = 1, nd∈ [1, n], ns= n) and (λ = n, nd∈ [1, n], ns= n), our schemes achieve the highest multicast throughputs proposed in the existing works.

Motivated by medium access control for resource-challenged wireless sensor networks whose main purpose is data collection, we consider the problem of queue scheduling with reduced queue state information. In particular, we consider a model with N sensor nodes, with pair-wise dependence, such that nodes i and i+1, 1 ≤ i ≤ N-1 cannot transmit together. For N=3, 4, and 5, we develop new throughput-optimal scheduling policies requiring only the empty-nonempty state of each queue, and also revisit previously proposed policies to rigorously establish their throughput-and delay-optimality. For N=3, there exists a sum-queue length optimal scheduling policy that requires only the empty-nonempty state of each queue. We show, however, that for N ≥ 4, there is no scheduling policy that uses only the empty-nonempty states of the queues and is sum-queue length optimal uniformly over all arrival rate vectors. We then extend our results to a more general class of interference constraints, namely, a star of cliques. Our throughput-optimality results rely on two new arguments: a Lyapunov drift lemma specially adapted to policies that are queue length-agnostic, and a priority queueing analysis for showing strong stability. Our study throws up some counterintuitive conclusions: 1) knowledge of queue length information is not necessary to achieve optimal throughput/delay performance for a large class of interference networks, 2) it is possible to perform throughput-optimal scheduling by merely knowing whether queues in the network are empty or not, and 3) it is also possible to be throughput-optimal by not always scheduling the maximum possible number of nonempty queues. We also show the results of numerical experiments on the performance of queue length agnostic scheduling vs. queue length aware scheduling, on several interference networks.

Age of Information (AoI) is a performance metric that captures the freshness of the information from the perspective of the destination. The AoI measures the time that elapsed since the generation of the packet that was most recently delivered to the destination. In this paper, we consider a single-hop wireless network with a number of nodes transmitting time-sensitive information to a Base Station and address the problem of minimizing the Expected Weighted Sum AoI of the network while simultaneously satisfying timely-throughput constraints from the nodes. We develop three low-complexity transmission scheduling policies that attempt to minimize AoI subject to minimum throughput requirements and evaluate their performance against the optimal policy. In particular, we develop a randomized policy, a Max-Weight policy and a Whittle's Index policy, and show that they are guaranteed to be within a factor of two, four and eight, respectively, away from the minimum AoI possible. In contrast, simulation results show that Max-Weight outperforms the other policies, both in terms of AoI and throughput, in every network configuration simulated, and achieves near optimal performance.

We consider the problem of scheduling in a multi- hop packet network so as to satisfy a set of arbitrary end-to-end delay requirements. A number of scheduling protocols are known for which end-to-end delay bounds can be derived. However, it is often the case that these end-to-end delay bounds are large for flows with small rate. This is clearly inappropriate for traffic types such as VoIP for which tight delay bounds are required but session rates are typically small. In this paper we study the problem of satisfying an arbitrary set of end-to-delay requirements. For a single server in isolation, precise conditions on whether or not a set of delay requirements can be satisfied are known. In contrast, for sessions in a multihop network, we show that deciding whether or not a set of delay requirements can be met is NP-hard. However, if the delay requirements satisfy a simple set of per-server and per- session conditions necessary for schedulability, we show that our proposed protocol can meet all the requirements up to some logarithmic factor. On the negative side, we construct examples in which some delay bound must be violated by a logarithmic factor even if the necessary conditions hold. We further demonstrate through simulation the advantage of our protocol against a counterpart that does not take delay requirements into consideration. We conclude the paper by extending our results to the problem of satisfying arbitrary delay bounds in an input-queued switch.

Delay Guarantees for Throughput-Optimal Wireless Link Scheduling. ad hoc networks; graph theory; radio links; radiofrequency interference; scheduling; telecommunication network topology; delay guarantees; throughput-optimal wireless link scheduling; arbitrary topology wireless ad-hoc networks; independent set scheduling probabilities; packet arrivals; scheduling policy; chromatic number; link interference graph; Delay; Throughput; Network topology; Interference constraints; Stability; Probability; Processor scheduling; Telecommunication traffic; Traffic control; Statistics. We consider the question of obtaining tight delay guarantees for throughout-optimal link scheduling in arbitrary topology wireless ad-hoc networks. We consider two classes of scheduling policies: 1) a maximum queue-length weighted independent set scheduling policy, and 2) a randomized independent set scheduling policy where the independent set scheduling probabilities are selected optimally. Both policies stabilize all queues for any set of feasible packet arrival rates, and are therefore throughput-optimal. For these policies and i.i.d. packet arrivals, we show that the average packet delay is bounded by a constant that depends on the chromatic number of the interference graph, and the overall load on the network. We also prove that this upper bound is asymptotically tight in the sense that there exist classes of topologies where the expected delay attained by any scheduling policy is lower bounded by the same constant. Through simulations we examine the scaling of the average packet delay with respect to the overall load on the network, and the chromatic number of the link interference graph.
