How Can Cyber-Physical Interdependence Affect the Mitigation of Cascading Power Failure?. cyber-physical systems; power engineering computing; power grids; power system measurement; power system reliability; risk management; smart power grids; communication technologies; power system monitoring; cascading failures; communication network; power infrastructure; cyber-physical integration; positive perspectives; negative perspectives; system-level simulations; failure propagation; integrated communication; smart grid system design; optimization; cyber-physical interdependence; power system control; cascading power failure mitigation; smart grid; Smart grids; Power system faults; Power system protection; Load modeling; Communication networks; Smart grid; failure propagation; cascading failure; load shedding control; modeling and simulations. Utilizing advanced communication technologies to facilitate power system monitoring and control, the smart grid is envisioned to be more robust and resilient against cascading failures. Although the integration of communication network does benefit the smart grid in many aspects, such benefits should not overshadow the fact that the interdependence between the communication network and the power infrastructure makes the smart grid more fragile to cascading failures. Thus, it is essential to understand the impact of such cyber-physical integration with interdependence from both positive and negative perspectives. In this paper, we develop a systematic framework to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of the cyber-physical interdependence. We use theoretical analysis and system-level simulations to characterize the impact of such interdependence. We identify two phases during the progress of failure propagation where the integrated communication and interdependence helps and hinders the mitigation of the failure, respectively, which provides practical guidance to smart grid system design and optimization.

Restricting Involuntary Extension of Failures in Smart Grids using Social Network Metrics. control engineering computing; failure analysis; graph theory; power system control; smart power grids; social networking (online); power equations; power system; topological properties; electrical properties; failure control algorithm; topological containment; power grid graph representation; networked control strategies; involuntary extension; social network metrics; modern communication technologies; Smart Grids; Monitoring; Smart grids; Measurement; Load modeling; Admittance; Communication networks. Modern communication technologies are expected to be available in the future Smart Grids to enable the control of equipments over the whole power grid. In this paper, we consider such networked control approach to address failures that may occur at any location of the grid, due to attacks or unit malfunction, and provide a wide-scale solution that prevent the failure impacts from spreading over a large area. Different from literature work that focuses on modifying power equations under the standard constraints of the power system, we estimate the impact of controlling different nodes on topological areas of the grid based on social metrics, which are derived from the graph capturing both the topological and electrical properties of the power grid. We propose a failure control algorithm for topological containment of failures in smart grid. Our algorithm also takes careful consideration of the impact the planned control has on the grid to avoid the possibly involuntary failure extension. We show that social metrics can efficiently trade off between the topological and electrical characteristics revealed by the power grid graph representation. We evaluate the performance against networked control strategies that only use power models to determine the actions to be performed at power nodes. Our results show that the proposed control scheme can effectively contain failures within their original location range.

Connected electric vehicles (EVs) are a key component of future intelligent and green transportation systems, and the penetration of EVs depends on convenient and cost-effective charging services. In addition to being charged at home or on parking lots, a charging network is needed for EVs right off the road. This paper first focuses on the optimal charging network design for charging service providers, considering the time-varying and location-dependent demands from vehicles and constraints of power grids. To optimize the charging station locations and the number of chargers in each station, we first model the coverage area of each possible location to estimate the dynamic charging requirements of EVs. Then, we formulate the problem as profit maximization, which is a mixed-integer program. To make the problem tractable, we investigate the features of the problem and obtain a necessary condition to deploy a charging station and derive the upper and lower bounds of the number of chargers in each station. Given the analysis, we take two steps to transform and relax the problem to convex optimization. A fast-converging search algorithm is further proposed based on the profit of each possible location. Using real vehicle traces, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can maximize the total profit when fewer charging stations and chargers are initially needed, which is more attractive for charging service providers.

The uncertainty and variability of renewable generation pose significant challenges to reliable power-grid operations. This paper designs robust online strategies for jointly operating energy storage units and fossil-fuel generators to achieve provably reliable grid operations at all times under high renewable uncertainty, without the need of renewable curtailment. In particular, we jointly consider two power system operations, namely day-ahead reliability assessment commitment (RAC) and real-time dispatch. We first extend the concept of “safe-dispatch sets” to our setting. While finding such safe-dispatch sets and checking their non-emptiness provide crucial answers to both RAC and real-time dispatch, their computation incurs high complexity in general. To develop computationally-efficient solutions, we first study a single-bus case with one generator-storage pair, where we derive necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the safe-dispatch sets. Our results reveal fundamental trade-offs between storage capacity and generator ramp-up/-down limits to ensure grid reliability. Then, for the more general multi-bus scenario, we split the net-demand among virtual generator-storage pairs (VGSPs) and apply our single-bus decision strategy to each VGSP. Simulation results on an IEEE 30-bus system show that, compared with state-of-art solutions, our scheme requires significantly less storage to ensure reliable grid operation without any renewable curtailment.

Being the largest blockchain with the capability of running smart contracts, Ethereum has attracted wide attention and its market capitalization has reached 20 billion USD. Ethereum not only supports its cryptocurrency named Ether but also provides a decentralized platform to execute smart contracts in the Ethereum virtual machine. Although Ether's price is approaching 200 USD and nearly 600K smart contracts have been deployed to Ethereum, little is known about the characteristics of its users, smart contracts, and the relationships among them. To fill in the gap, in this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on Ethereum by leveraging graph analysis to characterize three major activities on Ethereum, namely money transfer, smart contract creation, and smart contract invocation. We design a new approach to collect all transaction data, construct three graphs from the data to characterize major activities, and discover new observations and insights from these graphs. Moreover, we propose new approaches based on cross-graph analysis to address two security issues in Ethereum. The evaluation through real cases demonstrates the effectiveness of our new approaches.
