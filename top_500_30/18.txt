To monitor video QoE, we introduce YouSlow that can detect various playback events (e.g., start-up latency, rebufferings and bitrate changes) from video players while a video is being played. Using YouSlow, we have collected more than 400,000 YouTube views from more than 100 countries. We measured the impact of these playback events on video abandonment and found that rebufferings incur abandonment rates six times higher than start-up latency, mostly caused by pre-roll ads.

Even increasing the bitrate can raise abandonment rates by a factor of four compared to keeping the bitrate constant.", u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2016', u'keywords': u'quality of experience;quality of service;video streaming;QoE;QoS;cat videos;online video;quality of experience;over-the-top video streaming;YouSlow;playback event detection;start-up latency detection;YouTube;video abandonment;quality of service;Videos;Bit rate;YouTube;Monitoring;Quality of service;Streaming media;HTTP Video Streaming;Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) Streaming;Video Quality of Experience (QoE)', 'ID': u'7524426', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}

Thus, such videos have been gaining substantial interest from major content providers such as Google and Facebook. Adaptive streaming of multiview videos is, however, challenging because of the Internet dynamics and the diversity of user interests and network conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel rate adaptation algorithm for multiview videos (called MASH). Streaming multiview videos is more user centric than single-view videos, because it heavily depends on how users interact with the different views. To efficiently support this interactivity, MASH constructs probabilistic view switching models that capture the switching behavior of the user in the current session, as well as the aggregate switching behavior across all previous sessions of the same video. MASH then utilizes these models to dynamically assign relative importance to different views. Furthermore, MASH uses a new buffer-based approach to request video segments of various views at different qualities, such that the quality of the streamed videos is maximized while the network bandwidth is not wasted. We have implemented a multiview video player and integrated MASH in it. We compare MASH versus the state-of-the-art algorithm used by YouTube for streaming multiview videos. Our experimental results show that MASH can produce much higher and smoother quality than the algorithm used by YouTube, while it is more efficient in using the network bandwidth.

The conceptual architecture for DASH includes a web server and clients, which download media segments from the server. Clients select the resolution of video segments by using an Adaptive Bit-Rate (ABR) strategy; in particular, a throughput-based ABR is used in the case of live video applications. However, recent papers show that these strategies may suffer from the presence of proxies/caches in the network, which are instrumental in streaming video on a large scale. To face this issue, we propose to extend the MPEG DASH architecture with a Tracker functionality, enabling client-to-client sharing of control information. This extension paves the way to a novel family of Tracker-assisted strategies that allow a greater design flexibility, while solving the specific issue caused by proxies/caches; in addition, its utility goes beyond the problem at hand, as it can be used by other applications as well, e.g. for peer-to-peer streaming.', u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2016', u'keywords': u'video coding;video streaming;tracker-assisted rate adaptation;MPEG DASH live streaming;adaptive video streaming;HTTP;adaptive bit-rate;throughput-based ABR;MPEG DASH architecture;tracker functionality;client-to-client sharing;tracker-assisted strategies;peer-to-peer streaming;Streaming media;Servers;Transform coding;Bandwidth;Encoding;Video coding;Oscillators', 'ID': u'7524620', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}

We assign forward error correction (FEC) codes to each layer in the encoded bit-stream according to its importance. To this end, we develop a new distortion measure that quantifies the distortion in the reconstructed mesh when part of the bit-stream is lost. Experimental results with a collection of 3D meshes have been conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our solution. They indicate that with our proposed unequal error protection (UEP), the decoded mesh quality degrades more gracefully, compared to either no error protection (NEP) or equal error protection (EEP) methods, as the packet loss rate increases.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'June', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'743-752 vol.2', u'year': u'2002', u'keywords': u'solid modelling;visual communication;data compression;image coding;forward error correction;error correction codes;image reconstruction;mesh generation;decoding;unequal error protection;packet loss;3D mesh transmission;3D graphics streaming system;compressed progressive mesh;levels of details;forward error correction codes;FEC codes;distortion measure;reconstructed mesh;error protection methods;packet loss rate;Error correction codes;Propagation losses;Computer graphics;Forward error correction;Computer errors;Visualization;Mesh generation;Distortion measurement;Loss measurement;Decoding', 'ID': u'1019320', u'booktitle': u'Proceedings.Twenty-First Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies'}

Although the study is conducted at the frame level (as opposed to the slice level), it is observed that the inter-frame correlation structure for the frame-size sequence involves complicated forms of pseudo-periodicity that are mainly affected by the compression pattern of the sequence. A simple model for an MPEG traffic source is developed in which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the original captured video stream.
