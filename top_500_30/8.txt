Fdida', u'title': u'Efficient dynamic spectrum sharing through rate compensation and spectrum handoff', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'In this work, we propose a heuristic for dynamic spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. The concept of rate compensation is introduced so that cognitive radio users are able to achieve their rate requirement by performing adequately spectrum handoffs. Indeed, performing spectrum handoff can increase the achieved rate obtained by moving from unavailable channels to available ones. However, handoffs should also be reduced to decrease handoff delays and access contention in the network which can in turn impact the achieved rate.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'19-20', u'year': u'2013', u'keywords': u'cognitive radio;radio spectrum management;wireless channels;dynamic spectrum sharing;rate compensation;spectrum handoff;cognitive radio networks;cognitive radio users;rate requirement;unavailable channels;handoff delays;access contention;Resource management;Cognitive radio;Availability;Bandwidth;Delays;Dynamic scheduling', 'ID': u'6566725', u'booktitle': u'2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

Jing', u'title': u'Utility-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheduling in cognitive radio networks', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider the problem of cooperative spectrum sensing scheduling (C3S) in a cognitive radio network when there exist multiple primary channels. Deviated from the existing research our work focuses on a scenario in which each secondary user has the freedom to decide whether or not to participate in cooperative spectrum sensing; if not, the SU becomes a free rider who can eavesdrop the decision about the channel status made by others. Such a mechanism can conserve the energy for spectrum sensing at a risk of scarifying the spectrum sensing performance. To overcome this problem, we address the following two questions: \u201cwhich action (contributing to spectrum sensing or not) to take?\u201d and \u201cwhich channel to sense?\u201d To answer the first question, we model our framework as an evolutionary game in which each SU makes its decision based on its utility history, and takes an action more frequently if it brings a relatively higher utility. We also develop an entropy based coalition formation algorithm to answer the second question, where each SU always chooses the coalition (channel) that brings the most information regarding the status of the corresponding channel. All the SUs selecting the same channel to sense form a coalition. Our simulation study indicates that the proposed scheme can guarantee the detection probability at a low false alarm rate.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'165-169', u'year': u'2013', u'keywords': u'cognitive radio;cooperative communication;evolutionary computation;game theory;probability;radio networks;radio spectrum management;wireless channels;utility-based cooperative spectrum sensing scheduling;cognitive radio networks;C3S;multiple primary channel;SU;energy conservation;evolutionary game theory;entropy based coalition formation algorithm;detection probability;false alarm rate;M primary channel;N secondary user;energy consumption;Sensors;Entropy;Games;Cognitive radio;Uncertainty;Energy consumption;History;Cognitive radio networks;cooperative spectrum sensing;free rider;evolutionary game;coalition formation', 'ID': u'6566756', u'booktitle': u'2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

Lau', u'title': u'Improved rendezvous algorithms for heterogeneous cognitive radio networks', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been proposed to solve the spectrum scarcity problem. One of their fundamental procedures is to construct a communication link on a common channel for the users, which is referred as rendezvous. In reality, the capability to sense the spectrum may vary from user to user, and such users form what is known as a heterogeneous cognitive radio network (HCRN). The licensed spectrum is divided in to n channels, U = {1, 2,..., n}. We denote the capability of user i as Ci\u2286 U and the set of available channels (i.e. the channels not occupied by the paying users) as Vi\u2286 Ci. We study the rendezvous problem in HCRN under two circumstances: fully available spectrum (Vi= Ci) and partially available spectrum (Vi\u2260 Ci). For any two users a, b, we propose the Traversing Pointer (TP) algorithm that guarantees rendezvous in O(max{|Ca|,|Cb|}log log n) time slots for the fully available spectrum scenario. This result is only O (log log n) larger than our constructive lower bound. Moreover, it removes an O(min{|Ca|, |Cb|}) factor as compared to the state-of-the-art result (O(|Ca||Cb|) in [26]). For the partially available spectrum scenario, we propose the Moving Traversing Pointers (MTP) algorithm to guarantee rendezvous in O((max{|Va|, |Vb|})2log log n) time slots, which works more efficiently than the previous best result (O(|Ca||Cb|) in [25]) in various circumstances.

It is crucial for users in CRNs to search for neighbors via rendezvous process and thereby establish the communication links to exchange the information necessary for spectrum management and channel contention etc. This paper focuses on the design of algorithms for blind rendezvous, i.e., rendezvous without using any central controller and common control channel (CCC). We propose a jump-stay based channel-hopping (CH) algorithm for blind rendezvous. The basic idea is to generate CH sequence in rounds and each round consists of a jump-pattern and a stay-pattern. Users \u201cjump\u201d on available channels in the jump-pattern while \u201cstay\u201d on a specific channel in the stay-pattern. Compared with the existing CH algorithms, our algorithm achieves the following advances: i) guaranteed rendezvous without the need of time-synchronization; ii) applicability to rendezvous of multi-user and multi-hop scenarios. We derive the maximum time-to-rendezvous (TTR) and the upper-bound of expected TTR of our algorithm for both 2-user and multi-user scenarios (shown in Table I).

We view network coding as a spectrum shaper, in the sense that it increases spectrum availability to secondary users (SUs) and offers more structure of spectrum holes, which in turn improves the predictability of the primary spectrum. With this spectrum shaping effect of network coding, each SU can carry out adaptive channel sensing by dynamically updating the list of the (predicted) idle PU channels and giving priority to these channels for spectrum sensing. This dynamic spectrum access approach with network coding improves how SUs detect and utilize spectrum holes over PU channels. Our results show that compared to the existing approaches based on retransmission, both PUs and SUs can achieve higher stable throughput, thanks to the spectrum shaping effect of network coding.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'396-400', u'year': u'2011', u'keywords': u'cognitive radio;data communication;network coding;spectrum shaping;network coding;cognitive radio networks;primary users;data transmissions;spectrum availability;secondary users;spectrum holes;adaptive channel sensing;dynamic spectrum access;Sensors;Network coding;Throughput;Markov processes;Automatic repeat request;Cognitive radio;Adaptive systems;Cognitive radio networks;network coding;spectrum shaping;dynamic spectrum access', 'ID': u'5935190', u'booktitle': u'2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}
