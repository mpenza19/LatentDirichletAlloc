A result of this study has been the implementation of an efficient protection mechanism for information transfer over the public SMDS network, providing security against unauthorized disclosure, data modification, masquerading attacks, and unauthorized access to resources. A security and key management system, consisting of applications and protocols, has also been provided. This has been used for configuring security system attributes such as cryptographic keys, session keys, and security flags, and for the supervision of the SDE protocol and the maintenance of local secure management information bases.<<ETX>>', u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1414-1421 vol.3', u'year': u'1993', u'keywords': u'data communication systems;protocols;security of data;telecommunication standards;public service;IEEE 801.10 protocol;MAN;security system;WAN;secure data exchange;Switched Multimegabit Data Service;information transfer;public SMDS network;unauthorized disclosure;data modification;masquerading attacks;unauthorized access;key management system;cryptographic keys;session keys;security flags;SDE protocol;secure management information bases;Information security;Data security;Local area networks;Protection;Access protocols;Computer security;Communication system security;Distributed computing;Wide area networks;Control systems', 'ID': u'253407', u'booktitle': u"IEEE INFOCOM '93 The Conference on Computer Communications, Proceedings"}

Yang', u'title': u'Cross-domain password-based authenticated key exchange revisited', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'We revisit the problem of cross-domain secure communication between two users belonging to different security domains within an open and distributed environment. Existing approaches presuppose that either the users are in possession of public key certificates issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA), or the associated domain authentication servers share a long-term secret key. In this paper, we propose a four-party password-based authenticated key exchange (4PAKE) protocol that takes a different approach from previous work. The users are not required to have public key certificates, but they simply reuse their login passwords they share with their respective domain authentication servers. On the other hand, the authentication servers, assumed to be part of a standard PKI, act as ephemeral CAs that \u201ccertify\u201d some key materials that the users can subsequently exchange and agree on a session key. Moreover, we adopt a compositional approach. That is, by treating any secure two-party password-based key exchange protocol and two-party asymmetric-key based key exchange protocol as black boxes, we combine them to obtain a generic and provably secure 4PAKE protocol.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1052-1060', u'year': u'2013', u'keywords': u'cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;cross-domain password-based authenticated key exchange;cross-domain secure communication;public key certificates;trusted certificate;domain authentication servers;long-term secret key;four-party password-based authenticated key exchange protocol;two-party password-based key exchange protocol;two-party asymmetric-key based key exchange protocol;Protocols;Servers;Public key;Authentication;Electronic mail;Materials;Password-based protocol;key exchange;cross-domain;client-to-client', 'ID': u'6566895', u'booktitle': u'2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

To distribute the trust of CAs, notaries, as an independent party, are introduced to record certificates, and a client can request an audit proof of certificates from notaries directly. However, there are two challenges. On one hand, existing works consider the security of notaries insufficiently. Due to lack of systematic mutual verification, notaries might bring safety bottlenecks. On the other hand, the service of these works is not sustainable, when any party leaks its private key or fails. In this paper, we propose a Tripartite Public Key Infrastructure (TriPKI), using Certificates Authorities, Integrity Log Servers, and Domain Name Servers, to provide a basis for establishing secure SSL/TLS connections. Specifically, we apply checks-and balances among those three parties in the structure to make them verify mutually, which avoids any single party compromise.
