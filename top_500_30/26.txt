Shin', u'title': u'Decoding interfering signals with fewer receiving antennas', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Due to the hierarchical structure and heterogeneity of most deployed wireless networks, multiple data transmissions using the same communication resource, such as frequency band and time slot, are likely to occur in the same area. Hence, interference becomes critical to the decoding of interfered signals. There have already been numerous techniques dealing with interferences that can be implemented either at the transmitter, the receiver or both, to support simultaneous multi-user transmissions. This paper focuses on the reception design in multiple access channels (MACs) where multiple transmitters send data to a common receiver simultaneously. By exploiting the constructive/destructive interactions among interfering signals, we propose a receiver structure based on interference combination (ICom) incorporating zero-forcing (ZF) and successive interference cancellation (SIC). The proposed receiver structure does not require coordination at the transmitter side and can significantly reduce the number of receiving antennas at a moderate processing cost. The ICom-based reception is shown to be able to not only achieve a significant improvement of system spectral efficiency (SE) under stringent latency constraints, but also make a flexible tradeoff between the requirement of receiving antennas and signal processing complexity, thus facilitating its implementation and deployment.', u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2016', u'keywords': u'interference suppression;multi-access systems;multiuser channels;radiofrequency interference;receiving antennas;signal processing;wireless channels;interfering signals decoding;receiving antennas;deployed wireless networks;multiple data transmissions;communication resource;frequency band;time slot;multiuser transmissions;multiple access channels;MAC;multiple transmitters;interference combination;ICom based reception;zero forcing;successive interference cancellation;SIC;system spectral efficiency;signal processing;Interference;Receiving antennas;Signal processing;Decoding;Transmitting antennas', 'ID': u'7524403', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}

Further, capacity can be greatly enhanced through spatial division multiple access (SDMA), so that several users can transmit packets simultaneously to the BS. The system performance is determined by various transmission techniques, including methods for channel estimation, modulation, as well as channel coding. Conventional parameters such as packet error rate (PER) and bit error rate (BER) are unable to reflect the actual system performance because no consideration is given to the overheads incurred by the transmission techniques. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a novel concept called effective throughput to characterize the capacity available to users by incorporating all these factors. The effective throughput for a user can be viewed as the average number of successfully received data bits in an OFDM symbol after excluding erroneously received packets and the overheads due to channel estimation and coding. It also directly relates to the transmission delay of a user packet. The system effective throughput is the aggregated effective throughput of all users. Simulation results demonstrate that effective throughput can serve as a useful and more meaningful benchmark parameter in optimizing system performance.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'3', u'pages': u'1603-1613 vol.3', u'year': u'2003', u'keywords': u'OFDM modulation;packet radio networks;mobile radio;antenna arrays;space division multiple access;channel estimation;modulation;channel coding;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;OFDM;wireless system;multiple antenna;base station;spatial division multiple access;SDMA;system performance;channel estimation;modulation;channel coding;packet error rate;PER;bit error rate;BER;effective throughput;transmission delay;simulation;antenna array;Throughput;Multiaccess communication;Wireless communication;System performance;Channel estimation;Bit error rate;Base stations;Modulation coding;OFDM modulation;Channel coding', 'ID': u'1209183', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2003.

Li', u'title': u'Throughput Optimization of Wireless Mesh Networks with MIMO Links', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antennas use sophisticated physical layer techniques to provide significant benefits over conventional antenna technology. Multiple independent data streams can be sent over the MIMO antenna elements. MIMO link can also suppress interference from neighboring links as long as the total useful streams and interfering streams are no greater than the number of receiving antenna elements. For these reasons MIMO antennas are increasingly being considered for use in interference limited wireless mesh networks and have been adopted by WLAN and WIMAX standards. However, the benefits of the MIMO technology in improving network performance are limited unless the higher layer protocols also exploit these capabilities. In this paper we are interested in characterizing the benefits of cross-layer optimizations in interference limited wireless mesh networks with MIMO links. We formulate a framework where data routing at the protocol layer, link scheduling at the MAC layer and stream control at the physical layer can be jointly optimized for throughput maximization in the presence of interference. We then develop an efficient algorithm to solve the resulting throughput optimization problem subject to fairness constraints.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'May', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'2326-2330', u'year': u'2007', u'keywords': u'interference suppression;MIMO communication;optimisation;receiving antennas;wireless LAN;wireless mesh networks;MIMO links;multiple input multiple output antennas;sophisticated physical layer techniques;interference suppression;WLAN;WIMAX;layer protocols;Throughput;Wireless mesh networks;MIMO;Physical layer;Interference suppression;Receiving antennas;Wireless LAN;WiMAX;Routing protocols;Media Access Protocol', 'ID': u'4215856', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2007 - 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}

Such a capacity gain through power enhancement is revealed by our new insights of a co-channel enlarging effect. In particular, when the number of available channels (c) in a network is larger than that necessary for enabling the maximum set of simultaneous transmissions (c\u0303), allocating transmissions to those additional c-c\u0303 channels could enlarge the distance between the co-channel transmissions; the larger co-channel distance then allows a higher transmission power for higher link capacity. The finding of this paper specifically indicate that by exploiting the co-channel enlarging effect with power, one can realize the following gain on the capacity for MR-MC wireless networks: (i) In the channel-constraint region (c\u0303 <; c <; n\u03c6/2), if each node augments its power from the minimum Pminto Pminc/c\u0303\u03b1/2, then a gain of \u0398(log(c/c\u0303)\u03b1/2) is achieved; (ii) In the power-constraint region (c \u2265 n\u03c6/2), if each node sends at the maximum power level, Pmax= Pmin.nKor Pmin.2n\u03c6/2, depending on the power availability at a node, then a gain of \u0398(log n) or \u0398(n) is achieved, respectively.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1851-1859', u'year': u'2013', u'keywords': u'channel capacity;cochannel interference;radio networks;wireless channels;capacity gain;power enhancement;multiradio multichannel wireless networks;MR-MC wireless networks;cochannel enlarging effect;cochannel distance;cochannel transmissions;link capacity;channel-constraint region;power-constraint region;cochannel interference;Interference;Wireless networks;Receivers;Signal to noise ratio;Channel models;Bandwidth', 'ID': u'6566984', u'booktitle': u'2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}
