Sasaki', u'title': u'Multiwavelength optical networks with limited wavelength conversion', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'This paper proposes optical wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks with limited wavelength conversion that can efficiently support lightpaths (connections) between nodes. Each lightpath follows a route in the network and must be assigned a channel along each link in its route. The load /spl lambda//sub max/ of a set of lightpath requests is the maximum over all links of the number of lightpaths that use the link. At least /spl lambda//sub max/ wavelengths will be needed to assign channels to the lightpaths. If the network has full wavelength conversion capabilities then /spl lambda//sub max/ wavelengths are sufficient to perform the channel assignment. We propose ring networks with a fixed wavelength conversion capability within the nodes that can support all lightpath request sets with load /spl lambda//sub max/ at most W-1, where W is the number of wavelengths in each link. We also propose ring networks with selective pairwise wavelength conversion capability within the nodes that can support all lightpath request sets with load /spl lambda//sub max/ at most W. We also propose a star network with fixed wavelength conversion capability at its hub node that can support all lightpath request sets with load /spl lambda//sub max/ at most W. We extend this result to tree networks and networks with arbitrary topologies. These results show that significant improvements in traffic-carrying capacity can be obtained in WDM network by providing a very limited wavelength conversion capability within the network.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'489-498 vol.2', u'year': u'1997', u'keywords': u'wavelength division multiplexing;optical fibre networks;network topology;telecommunication traffic;channel capacity;multiwavelength optical networks;lightpaths;wavelength division multiplexed networks;limited wavelength conversion;WDM;channel assignment;ring networks;selective pairwise wavelength conversion;star network;fixed wavelength conversion;hub node;network topology;traffic-carrying capacity;Optical fiber networks;Optical wavelength conversion;Wavelength division multiplexing;WDM networks;Optical fibers;Wavelength routing;Circuits;Asynchronous transfer mode;Milling machines;Rivers', 'ID': u'644498', u'booktitle': u"Proceedings of INFOCOM '97"}

The current technology of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) offers bandwidth granularity that match peak electronic transmission speed by dividing the fiber bandwidth into multiple wavelengths. However, the bandwidth of a single wavelength is too large for certain traffic. Time division multiplexing (TDM) allows multiple traffic streams to share the bandwidth of a wavelength efficiently. While introducing wavelength converters and time slot interchangers improve the network blocking performance, it is often of interest to know the incremental benefits offered by every additional stage of switching. As all-optical networks in future are expected to employ heterogeneous switching architectures, it is necessary to have generalized network model that allows one to study these networks under a unified framework. In this paper, a network model, called the Trunk Switched Network (TSN), is proposed to facilitate modeling and analysis of such networks. An analytical model for evaluating the blocking performance of a class of TSN's has also been developed. Using the analytical model, it is shown that a significant performance improvement is obtained with a time-space switch with no wavelength conversion at each node in a multi-wavelength TDM switched network.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': u'1', u'pages': u'179-188 vol.1', u'year': u'2001', u'keywords': u'wavelength division multiplexing;time division multiplexing;optical frequency conversion;telecommunication traffic;optical fibre networks;switching networks;generalized framework;time-space switched optical networks;photonic switching;all-optical time switched networks;wavelength division multiplexing;bandwidth granularity;WDM;fiber bandwidth;time division multiplexing;multiple traffic streams;bandwidth sharing;wavelength converters;time slot interchangers;network blocking performance;heterogeneous switching architecture;generalized network model;Trunk Switched Network;analytical model;time-space switch;multi-wavelength TDM switched network;Optical fiber networks;Optical wavelength conversion;Bandwidth;Wavelength division multiplexing;Telecommunication traffic;Time division multiplexing;Wavelength conversion;WDM networks;All-optical networks;Analytical models', 'ID': u'916700', u'booktitle': u'Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2001.

CayleyNets are attractive virtual topologies because they support the largest number of nodes for four-neighbor connection in a range of diameters. In general, CayleyNets are bi-directional and there are N=p/spl times/k nodes, where p is a prime and k is a factor of p-1. The analysis shows that CayleyNet has a similar performance in channel efficiency, total and user throughput as the ShuffleNet with N=4/sup kspl times/k. However, CayleyNet has the advantages of a more flexible network size and symmetric transmission distance. Compared with the N=2/sup kspl times/k ShuffleNet and toroidal mesh, the CayleyNet has a superior performance.<<ETX>>', u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'June', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1260-1267 vol.3', u'year': u'1994', u'keywords': u'network topology;wavelength division multiplexing;optical links;performance evaluation;telecommunication network routing;hypercube networks;multihop WDM-based lightwave network;CayleyNet;wavelength division multiplexing;terabit lightwave networks;virtual topologies;four-neighbor connection;performance;channel efficiency;throughput;network size;transmission distance;1 Tbit/s;Spread spectrum communication;Network topology;Bidirectional control;Frequency;Wavelength division multiplexing;Optical fibers;Optical transmitters;Telecommunication network topology;Performance analysis;Throughput', 'ID': u'337546', u'booktitle': u"Proceedings of INFOCOM '94 Conference on Computer Communications"}

We quantify the gain in the blocking probability when wavelength interchanging cross-connects are used compared to the case when wavelength-selective cross-connects are used, and show that this gain decreases rapidly with an increasing number of fibers on a link.

The network cost includes the cost of the transceivers required at the nodes as well as the number of wavelengths. The transceiver cost includes the cost of terminating equipment as well as higher-layer electronic processing equipment, and in practice, can dominate over the cost of the number of wavelengths in the network. The networks support dynamic (time varying) traffic streams that are at lower rates (e.g., OC-3, 155 Mb/s) than the lightpath capacities (e.g., OC-48, 2.5 Gb/s). A simple OWDM ring is the point-to-point ring, where traffic is transported on WDM links optically, but switched through nodes electronically. Although the network is efficient in using link bandwidth, it has high electronic and opto-electronic processing costs. Two OWDM ring networks are given that have similar performance but are less expensive. Two other OWDM ring networks are considered that are nonblocking, where one has a wide sense nonblocking property and the other has a rearrangeably nonblocking property.
