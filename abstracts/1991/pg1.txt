abstract={Routing algorithms are proposed for setting up calls on a circuit-switched basis in linear lightwave networks (LLN), i.e., networks composed only of linear components, including controllable power combiners and dividers, and possibly linear (non-regenerative) optical amplifiers. The overall problem is decomposed into three subproblems: (1) physical path allocation, (2) checking for violations of the special optical constraints on the allocated physical path, and (3) channel assignment. Only point to point connections are considered. The physical path allocation technique uses the K-shortest path algorithm and tries to minimize the number of sources potentially interfering with each other, as a result of the incoming call. A channel assignment heuristic that tends to spread out calls evenly among the available channels works better than one that tries to maximize channel reuse.<<ETX>>},

year={1991},
volume={},

pages={10-19 vol.1},
abstract={A straightforward approach is found for computing the total aggregate capacity of a multihop network with hot-potato routing, and for finding the probability distribution of the number of hops taken by a representative test packet. The rows and columns of the state transition matrix used by this approach each contain, at most, two nonzero elements. The approach is valid for any symmetric network connection diagram under conditions of uniform loading. Results obtained for recirculating perfect shuffle connection diagrams show that the achievable aggregate capacity degrades relative to the capacity maximizing store-and-forward routing as the number of network nodes increases, but even for networks containing several thousand nodes, it is no worse than 25% of that for store-and-forward. Increasing the link data speed by more than a factor of four will produce, overall, a higher aggregate capacity.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The power distribution of circulant topologies for passive fiber optic local communication networks (FOLCN) in the shot-noise limited case is analyzed. This class of topologies is chosen for its symmetries in both logical structure and power distribution, as well as for its mathematical tractability. Analysis according to a mathematical model for power distribution allows comparison of various circulant topologies, where circulance refers to a particular topological symmetry, and demonstrates that a high degree of connectivity aids even distribution of power. Appropriate topological design yields a network that can support thousands of users within a 50-dB loss budget, when low loss components are used.<<ETX>>},

volume={},
number={},
pages={39-48 vol.1},
abstract={The optimal design of windows for virtual circuits has been studied for high-speed, wide-area data networks in an asymptotic framework in which the delay-bandwidth product is the large parameter. The authors (1990) previously proposed and evaluated a new class of algorithms for dynamically adapting windows in single path, multi-hop networks. Here they develop algorithms for networks having multiple paths with different propagation delays. The source of each virtual circuit (VC) measures the round-trip response time of its packets and uses these measurements to adjust its window with the goal of satisfying certain asymptotic identities that have been proven to hold in stationary asymptotically optimal designs. Also evaluated is the performance of the new adaptive algorithms in realistic, nonstationary conditions by simulations of networks with data rates of 45 Mb/s and propagation delays of up to 47 ms. The simulation results generally confirm that the realizations of the adaptive algorithms give stable, efficient performance and are close to theoretical expectations.<<ETX>>},

pages={59-68 vol.1},
abstract={A connection management access protocol (CMAP) for managing multipoint connections in high-speed packet switched networks is described. The protocol is targeted to broadband integrated services digital networks (BISDN) using the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) communication standard. To establish a multipoint connection, a client first creates a call between itself and the network. The client creating a call is designated the owner of the call. Immediately after creation, the owner is the only endpoint participating in the call. Additional endpoints are added either by invitation from the owner, invitation from another client of the network, or by explicitly requesting to be added. These three modes are sufficient for supporting point-to-point communication (for example, a telephone call), many-to-many communication (for example, a conference call), one-to-many communication (for example, broadcast video), and many-to-one communication (for example, error logging).<<ETX>>},

pages={69-75 vol.1},
abstract={The capability of the deflection network to provide circuit service, i.e., virtual circuit service with guaranteed bandwidth, is investigated. Such a capability is achieved by modifying the datagram access algorithm and by introducing additional information in the packet header which allows prioritized access via token requests. This mechanism guarantees the needed resources to the already established connections. A second mechanism, which is superimposed on the previous one, is used to measure the resources available and to assign them upon request. The whole mechanism is completely distributed and very robust, since it is based on measures that reflect the real status of the network. A performance analysis is carried out by simulation. In particular, the capability is shown to guarantee the bandwidth to each connection, and the degradation in the network's maximum throughput due to the token mechanism is investigated. Some modifications to improve the circuit capacity are introduced and their effectiveness is evaluated.<<ETX>>},

pages={83-91 vol.1},
abstract={The loss performance is studied of an ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) multiplexer, whose input consists of the superposition of a multiplicity of homogeneous ON-OFF sources. The approach is based on the approximation of the actual input process by means of a suitably chosen two-state Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP), as a simple and effective choice for the representation of the superimposed arrival streams. To accurately evaluate the cell loss performance, a matching procedure was developed which allows the derivation of a tight upper bound on the cell loss probability and the characterization of its asymptotic behavior as the buffer size increases. Moreover, this procedure yields insight into the multiplexer performance behavior, as the buffer size and the source parameters are varied, and clarifies the modeling limits implied by the choice of an approximating MMPP with only two states.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Store-and-forward techniques in computer communication networks are addressed. The performance estimation and the stability aspects of an input buffer limiting (IBL) scheme are presented. The model is formulated with respect to the state-dependent effective input rate and effective service rate. The computation of the performance parameters with respect to the effective service rate yields satisfactory results when blocking probabilities are not restricted to very low values (<<1). The stability aspects are assessed with the results from catastrophe theory; the stability is characterized as fold catastrophe. It is seen that, at higher rates of input, this maximum value of the IBL ratio approaches the capacity law limit proposed by S. Lam and M. Reiser (1979). Further, this method also approximately indicates the no-congestion region.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors study the effect of increasing buffer capacities on the performance of queuing networks that use probabilistic or state-dependent routing. The approach is to establish strong stochastic ordering relations on several performance measures using sample path arguments. In particular, it is proved that the throughput is monotonically increasing with respect to an overall capacity vector in networks with exponential service times, or deterministic service times and synchronous transmission. However, in networks with deterministic service times and asynchronous transmission this property may not hold, as seen through a counterexample. A simple retransmission algorithm is proposed to overcome this problem. Finally, the monotonicity property is also shown to hold in tandem networks with exponential servers where blocked customers are retransmitted rather than rejected.<<ETX>>},

An efficient algorithm to solve this problem is presented. It is shown that the problem becomes NP-complete when there are two management centers per region with the regions being disjoint.

A network management application, e.g., alarm surveillance, can be mostly accomplished by several processes distributed over a network. In order to predict the completion time for such an application, components, whether software or hardware, incurring a delay must be identified. A proposed model, which is referred to as the end-to-end performance model, specifies: (1) components which incur a significant delay in a management application, (2) their characteristics, and (3) their interactions. In determining the major delay components, management application processing, protocol processing, transmission delay, and protocol conversion, are incorporated.

A hierarchical characterization of discrete-time traffic processes is used to capture the short-term and the long-term dependencies of process segments as well as different time scales according to cell, burst, dialog, and call layers of traffic streams in ATM systems.

abstract={A novel packet switch architecture is proposed based on a channel grouped virtual circuit (CG-VC) scheme for high-speed communication networks. The case is considered in which there are several parallel channels between two switching nodes. The CG-VC scheme allows a packet to select an available channel in such a way as to avoid congested channels using a simple, hardware-based, self-routing mechanism. As a result, the architecture provides efficient channel use and low switching delay. The performance of the proposed switch is evaluated by simulation. The results show the proposed switch significantly improves channel utilization and switching delay compared with conventional single-channel allocation transmission policies.<<ETX>>},

pages={163-170 vol.1},
abstract={A self-routing space-division fast packet switch architecture is proposed which achieves output queuing with a reduced number of internal paths (O(N)). The switch architecture is a multi-level binary tree in which each branch constitutes a group of paths that are shared by all the packets destined to a subset of output ports. The reduction in the number of internal paths is obtained by interleaving the packet distribution and packet concentration functions throughout the switch fabric. Packet loss may occur at each level of the tree and is dependent on the degree of concentration exercised at that level. Owing to the binary tree structure of the switching fabric, a simple mathematical analysis is performed in order to determine the concentration parameters appropriate for each level. Several implementation architectures based on sorting networks are described.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A high-performance copy network, which supports multicast fast packet switching in the broadband integrated services digital network (B-ISDN), is proposed. The network uses a banyan multistage interconnection network (MIN) with speedup and requires no intermediate buffering. It has been recognized that the copying process is, in general, a difficult one. Two important design issues, namely, obtaining multiple copies of packets and assigning destination addresses of the copies, are pursued. A solution to these issues by developing a novel two-phase copying process is presented. An analytical performance model with a special structure of Markov chains, called a branching process, is formulated. Numerical results using this model for a constant number of copies as well as for a geometrically distributed number of copies show that the proposed copy network achieves very low packet blocking probability. Simulation results are provided to confirm the analytical model.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A novel approach to the delay analysis of various service disciplines in symmetric token ring networks is presented. It is shown that exact or approximate expressions for the average packet delay of different service disciplines can be directly derived by the delay expression of the exhaustive service system. This is accomplished by: (a) inflating, by an appropriate factor, the packet size of the discipline whose performance is analyzed; and (b) using the inflated packet in the delay expression of the exhaustive service system. The proposed method is applied to the limited service and time token systems, and its accuracy is verified by simulation results. Advantages of the method are its higher accuracy over previous analytic methods and its robustness to ring latency and other system parameters.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A performance analysis of slotted rings is presented based on a register-insertion method which is proposed for broadband ring topology networks. The analysis is carried out under the assumption that each node contains a finite buffer space. A Markovian model is developed for the ring. The arrival process of packets from upstream nodes is determined from the model. The probability of buffer overflow and the probability distribution of the number of packets in a buffer are calculated using the model.

abstract={The effects of station buffer capacity on the performance of token-ring networks are investigated. The network is modeled as a multi-queue system with a single cyclic server, one finite buffer queue and an arbitrary number of infinite buffer queues, a nonexhaustive service discipline, constant station walking time, Poisson arrival processes, and general message service time distributions. For the particular cases of exponentially distributed and constant message service times, approximate average message delays for both the finite and infinite buffer stations and the probability of message blocking at the finite buffer station are given in explicit expressions. Several numerical results are presented. Interesting conclusions are obtained from comparing network performance in the case when the network traffic load is completely balanced with the case when the finite buffer station is much more heavily loaded than the individual infinite buffer stations.<<ETX>>},

pages={211-220 vol.1},
abstract={A novel, hybrid protocol LAN called TORNET2 is proposed, and its performance is evaluated. TORNET2 is a ring intended for high-speed applications in the 100 Mb/s range. Short-packet, high-priority traffic is handled by the register insertion technique. Combining this protocol with the early-release token protocol for handling low-priority asynchronous traffic is the novel aspect of TORNET2. The hybrid protocol operates in such a way that high-priority packets may be embedded in low-priority packets. This results in the best possible transfer delay for the high-priority traffic. In fact, the high-priority traffic is unaffected by the presence of low-priority traffic. Low-priority traffic is not locked out by high-priority traffic, but its transfer delay performance degrades as the volume of high-priority traffic increases. An approximate performance analysis of the TORNET2 network along with simulation results to verify the analysis is presented.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The performance of the slotted ALOHA multiple access protocol in a high-speed bidirectional passive bus network, where transmissions are in the form of packets of constant length, is studied. Slotted ALOHA is generally considered to have better throughput performance than unslotted ALOHA, whose maximum throughput is known to be 1/(2e), independent of station configuration. It is shown that, with a probabilistic station configuration, the throughput of slotted ALOHA can degrade to 1/(3e) when the end-to-end propagation delay is significantly larger than the packet transmission time. Nevertheless, in some very high speed bidirectional bus networks with a deterministic station configuration, the throughput of slotted ALOHA can be as high as 1/2.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The average throughput, average delay, and the first exit time performances are determined for a slotted two-packet replication Aloha protocol in a fading communications channel environment using a two-state Gilbert (1960) channel error model with memory. Comparison to slotted Aloha without replication shows that a smaller total average delay can be achieved by using two-packet replication. Average throughput is improved in some cases. However replication reduces the stability of the system. The Markov model for the slotted replication Aloha system is discussed, and the stability is quantified in terms of the expected first exit time from the safe channel operating region.<<ETX>>},

pages={237-246 vol.1},
abstract={A first-order recursive retransmission control policy for a two-station slotted-Aloha network is presented. Under this policy, terminals adjust their retransmission probability at the end of each slot based on feedback from the current slot. The fundamental difference between a single-station and a two-station network (packet radio) is the interaction between the terminal groups, which occurs because some terminals are in transmission range of both stations, resulting in interference. Retransmission control keeps the offered traffic levels near the maximum throughput point and divides the channel capacity fairly between the two terminal groups. The control is intuitively appealing: to acquire channel capacity in proportion to its arrival rate, each group balances efforts to increase its throughput with a certain backoff that permits channel use by the other group.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The problem of management and control in a large and, for simplicity, homogeneous packet-switched network is investigated. In particular, routing is considered as an important function of network management. The network consists of several individually controlled domains interconnected via gateway links. Each domain is controlled by its own network control center, while the overall network performance is managed by the integrated network control center. Each center has only a portion of the information required for global routing. The impact of the reduced information available at each center on network performance is investigated. A general approach to designing a hierarchical algorithm for routing in multi-domain networks is presented. A heuristic procedure suitable for packet-switched networks is proposed. An example of the algorithm is shown. Its performance is compared against a lower bound to the network performance.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Policy routing protocols incorporate policy related constraints into the route computation and packet forwarding functions for inter-administrative domain (AD) communication. However, this functionally exacerbates the already critical problem of routing information distribution and storage overhead in very large internets (e.g., 100000 ADs). The authors investigate the scalability of the inter-domain policy routing (IDPR) architecture. In particular, they present an informal analysis of connectivity database and update overhead. A model of the IDPR architecture is defined and tested by varying several parameters. The results obtained illustrate the scaling properties of the IDPR architecture and their dependencies upon internet configuration, connectivity among ADs, and number of policies. It is found that, under certain reasonable assumptions, global information for an internet of 5000 transit ADs (and 50000 stub ADs) will occupy on the order of 2.5 MB of storage in the route server.<<ETX>>},

These charging measures and algorithms have the property that, by minimizing the individual domain's expenses, they also minimize the global resource consumption. In addition, a distributed destination-based algorithm is presented for computing optimal paths that allows for faster response time in highly dynamic and unreliable internets.

abstract={The problem of minimizing the internetwork packet fragmentation cost by selecting an appropriate route from the origin to the destination network is investigated. It is shown that this problem is NP-complete, and optimal (minimum fragmentation cost) paths cannot be computed by fast algorithms when the intranetwork strategy is used. Then, the internetwork fragmentation strategy is considered, and a fast (i.e., polynomial time) routing algorithm, called Maxbottleneck, is presented. When a greedy fragmentation scheme is adopted, like the classical maximal one, the algorithm produces an optimal path when some conditions on the networks' maximum packet sizes are met. A novel, non-greedy fragmentation scheme called bottleneck is also proposed. It is shown that the path produced by Maxbottleneck is always optimal when the bottleneck scheme is used.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors examine the networking environment of the future, pose the technical questions that need to be addressed to provide service assurance, and propose a set of strategies for congestion avoidance. Congestion avoidance is recommended instead of congestion control, which has very limited value in a high-speed network, where the latency in detecting congestion and reacting to it may make the control ineffective. The proposed solution consists of enforcing rate-control at the network edges, bandwidth reservation for continuous bit oriented (CBO) traffic using a unique two-queue strategy, and a scheduler-based packet cross-connect system. Simulation results of a Q+ model of an access node are presented that quantify the performance of this solution and compare it to existing congestion control mechanisms. The results demonstrate that it is possible to meet the differing needs of traffic types needing datagram transport and those needing virtual-circuit transport by using an intelligent scheduling strategy and a meaningful packet transport protocol.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Existing packet combining schemes, implemented either by hardware or software, developed for hot-spot congestion-control in multiprocessors are not applicable for use in telecommunication systems. The authors propose a hot-spot prevention scheme which exploits the structural characteristics of buffered delta networks to regulate the traffic. This scheme prevents the tree saturation by controlling the flow of the packets into the network and ensures that the hot-spot traffic can be supported with little degradation to the throughput of the uniform traffic, even when more than one hot-spot exists. The scheme retains all the desirable properties, including packet order preserving, of buffered delta networks, and is shown by simulations to be highly effective under either light or heavy hot-spot traffic. Since no a priori knowledge of the traffic patterns is required, the proposed scheme can be applied equally well to buffered delta networks in multiprocessors and telecommunication systems.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Congestion control and switch buffer allocation techniques are proposed that allow for packet admission and transfer based on the switch and network occupancy. The packets are transferred if the required bandwidth is smaller than the bandwidth currently available. Otherwise, the packets are stored in the buffer. If the buffer is full, the incoming packets are dropped and the transmission is delayed either at the sender or at the nearest node. It is proven analytically that the packets will not be dropped if the buffer size is greater than or equal to twice the size of the queue length and the traffic will not increase during propagation delay of shut-off signal between the switch and either the source or the nearest node, depending on where the transmission is delayed. The performance of different networks is evaluated to show the applications of the proposed techniques.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A novel strategy for the transmission and multiplexing of delay-sensitive traffic, e.g., voice and video, in packet networks is described. The strategy provides bounded end-to-end delay to all delay-sensitive traffic guarantees loss-free transmission to any traffic with such a requirement. To achieve statistical multiplexing gain, loss performance is provided to the rest of delay-sensitive traffic on an as-needed basis, with possible distinction among different classes. Bounded end-to-end delay is obtained by performing statistical multiplexing at the switching nodes on a duration-limited basis. Loss-free transmission is achieved by means of an underlying service discipline called stop-and-go queuing. The performance of the strategy for some special cases is analyzed, and analytical expressions for the loss probability are derived.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The optimal synthesis of private telecommunication networks subject to multiple nonsimultaneous demands is considered. A model is given for the multiservice network synthesis model with an accurate representation of the conversion and access costs, while maintaining a classical multicommodity flow representation of the network. This is done by increasing the original network to produce an augmented network. Two decomposition methods for solving the network synthesis problem are presented. The first one is a classical Lagrangian relaxation method and the second is a resource-decomposition-type technique. Some preliminary computational results in both cases are presented. These show that the two methods converge within reasonable computation times. The results also demonstrate that the multihour aspect of the synthesis of multiservice networks should be taken into account in order to realize fully the economies that are possible due to the noncoincidence of different types of demands.<<ETX>>},

Receptivity is basically defined as the probability that a rejection of a communication request does not occur, i.e., it is the probability that the network will be receptive to all expected concurrent communication requests. A graph-theoretic result is derived which places upper bounds on the maximum number of concurrently communicating origin-destination pairs which a given computer network can accommodate. The bound is dependent on several important network parameters including the number of network links, the maximum link capacity, and a measure of the network's average minimum hop distance. The upper bound result is used as a basis for estimating receptivity. The estimate for receptivity compares favorably with simulated values of receptivity for several example networks.<<ETX>>},

pages={368-381 vol.1},
abstract={A solution for multi-media traffic queueing analysis is presented. The key properties of multi-media traffic are characterized by a great diversity in correlation and burstiness. The multi-media traffic is constructed based on various two-state Markov chains. Upon a time index normalization, the queue is modeled by a multi-dimensional discrete Markov process. The entire solution of queue length distributions is constructed. It uses a generating function approach. By matrix spectral decomposition and diagonalization, one can decompose the evaluation of each individual vanishing/non-vanishing root. It is found that all the vanishing roots must be real and all the complex non-vanishing roots can be ignored. In numerical studies, the time index normalization in source modeling is first verified, and the effect of multi-media traffic properties on ATM queues is examined.<<ETX>>},

pages={382-390 vol.1},
abstract={A credit manager algorithm (CMA) is introduced and used to control the flow of packets between a subscriber station (or a local area network) and the access to a high-speed metropolitan area network. The parameters of the algorithm are used to regulate the mean throughput and the level of burstiness at the subscriber-to-network interface (SNI). Simulation results are presented for the average system size at the SNI, representing the packet delays at the sender's buffer. The regulated output traffic across the SNI is statistically characterized by categorizing its states into three modes; idle, burst, and restricted modes. Presented also is a model for the queueing behavior of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)-type system, where single segment packets (cells) are served. A numerical method is used to solve for the underlying system state probabilities.<<ETX>>},

pages={391-399 vol.1},
abstract={The resequencing delay for a queueing system with multiple servers under threshold-type scheduling is analyzed. The general expressions for the average total delay, which is the sum of resequencing delay and queuing delay, are derived. The expressions are also applicable to the conventional M/M/n queuing system as the special case of zero-threshold policy. Next, the numerical calculation is carried out for a queuing system with three servers under a threshold-type schedule to consider the impact of the multiple thresholds on the average resequencing delay. It is found that the resequencing delay as well as the queuing delay for a queuing system with multiple servers of different service rates can be reduced under threshold-type scheduling by selecting the threshold values appropriately. Threshold-type scheduling is more effective in reducing the resequencing delay compared to the queuing delay, especially in the region of modest traffic intensity and as the difference in the service rates becomes larger.<<ETX>>},

year={1991},
volume={},

pages={400-409 vol.1},
abstract={The problem of scheduling impatient customers in a non-preemptive G/GI/1 queue is considered. Every customer has a random deadline to the beginning of its service. Given the distribution of the customer deadlines (rather than their exact values), a scheduling policy decides the customer service order and also which customer(s) to reject. The objective is to find an optimal policy which maximizes the number of customers served before their deadlines. It is shown that LIFO (last-in first-out) is an optimal service order when the deadlines are i.i.d. (independently identically distributed) random variables with a concave cumulative distribution function. There is an optimal policy in the LIFO-TO (time-out) class, as defined by the authors. For the M/GI/1 queue, it is proved that unforced idle times are not allowed under this optimal policy. It is also shown that the optimal LIFO-TO policy assigns a fixed critical time (i.e., its maximum waiting time) to every customer. When the customer waiting times are unknown, the optimal policy for an M/M/1 queue becomes the LIFO-PO (push-out) policy, with a fixed buffer size used as a rejection threshold.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Store-and-forward deadlock prevention in communication networks is addressed. The approach adopted is that of establishing buffer classes in order to prevent cyclic waiting chains. This type of solution usually requires many buffers. The main contribution of the current study is in showing that the number of required buffers can be reduced considerably by using a hierarchical organization of the network. A novel hierarchical scheme for arbitrary networks is proposed, that features a trade-off between the communication overhead and the buffer requirements of the routing. This trade-off can be shown to be close to optimal.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The problem of managing telephone network resources for private virtual networks is discussed. Implementing a real-time resource counter on a distributed system is investigated. A correctness condition is developed for a real-time resource counter, and several approaches to implementing it are described. The various approaches are evaluated on a model that accounts for load-dependent message-processing delays, using both analytic and simulation techniques. The results of the performance studies also suggest heuristics for configuring a resource counter on a distributed system. A very simple approach, in which requests that cannot be satisfied locally are randomly forwarded to other processors, works well over a wide range of loads and system sizes. Unless a very large number of processors is required to handle the requests for resources or heavy overloads are expected, this may be the best algorithm.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The analysis of a rate-based access control scheme in high speed environments that is based on a buffered leaky bucket algorithm is presented. The analysis is carried out in discrete time, which is representative of asynchronous transfer mode environments. For the cell arrivals to the leaky bucket, a general discrete Markovian arrival process is considered which models bursty and correlated sources. The introduction of the deficit function allows the reduction of the original problem to a more standard discrete time queuing system with the same arrival process. As an important special case, the detailed analysis of the binary Markov source throttled by such rate-based access control schemes is presented. Along with explicit recursions for computation of state probabilities and simple characterization of the asymptotic behavior of the queue buildup, some guidelines for the parameter selection of these schemes is provided.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Two timed token protocols, the IEEE 802.4 and FDDI (fiber distributed data interface), are considered. Although IEEE 802.4 and FDDI have similar protocol rules, the different method of measuring the duration of the generic token rotation has imposed separate analyses for the two protocols. Presented is a general proof of equivalence between IEEE 802.4 and FDDI networks, where both consist of queues belonging to two priority classes. Having proved this equivalence, it is possible to extend results formally demonstrated for one protocol to the other. In particular, the results regarding the bounds on mean and maximum token rotation time derived for FDDI by Sevcik and Johnson (1987) can also be extended to IEEE 802.4 networks.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A multibeam fast packet switching satellite communication network serving multiple zones is studied. The synchronous time division multiple access protocol (TDMA) is used in transmitting messages in the uplink channels while the asynchronous time division multiple access protocol (ATDMA) is used in the downlink channels. Moreover, fast packet switching capabilities are assumed on-board the satellite. Alternatives for the architecture of the on-board fast packet switching fabric are considered. The performance of the considered approaches has been derived by theoretical analysis and computer simulations. A novel input queuing technique is also proposed and analyzed to show that it achieves better performance with respect to the classical input queuing approach. Therefore, by means of the novel input queuing approach it is possible to lower the end-to-end delay without increasing the complexity of the on-board equipment.<<ETX>>},

It supports on-line repairability and is more cost-effective than other fault-tolerant multistage interconnection networks with similar fault-tolerant capability. Further, it provides better permutation capability than a DOT network of the same size, in the presence of any single fault. The number of favorite memory modules to which a processor can communicate with the shortest delay is increased compared to a DOT network of similar size. The general algorithm for computing the path lengths between a source-destination pair has been proposed.

abstract={An extended IEEE 802.5 protocol suitable for transmitting time-constrained messages in a token ring network is studied. It differs from traditional token ring protocols in that time constraints of messages are incorporated explicitly. In this protocol, the laxities of messages are mapped into priorities. The message with the highest priority is transmitted first. As a result, this protocol approximates the optimal minimum-laxity-first policy. It is found that in the worst case the protocol can send at least 50% of the messages sent by the optimal one. This ratio is independent of the number of priorities and the priority assignment function used in the protocol. On the other hand, simulation results show that the average performance of the protocol improves as the number of priorities increases and that a simple priority assignment function is sufficient to yield satisfactory performance.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Performance unfairness has been an open problem in the IEEE 802.6 (distributed queue dual bus, or DQDB) protocol. The unfairness can be amplified when erasure capability is introduced. This study is motivated by some efforts made by others in attempting to balance throughput in DQDB networks. The authors investigate two more fairness criteria-packet delay and packet blocking. The three fairness criteria are studied together with the p/sub i/-persistent protocol, assuming erasure capability in the network. For each criterion, values of various network settings which determine the achievability of the criterion are calculated analytically, and the performance characteristics of the protocol are shown. The analytical results closely match the results from simulations of the protocol. The results demonstrate that the fairness criterion on packet delay results in the best performance. However, the fair-packet delay requirement is also more difficult to maintain since it is the most sensitive to network load changes.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Experimental results are presented showing the number of disjoint products and computer time involved in generating sum of disjoint product (SDP) terms. To help obtain the results, the authors have considered 19 benchmark networks containing paths (cuts) varying from 4 (4) to 780 (7376). Several SDP techniques are reviewed and are generalized into three propositions to find their inherent merits and demerits. An efficient SDP technique is, then, utilized to run input files of paths/cuts preprocessed using (1) cardinality, (2) lexicographic, and (3) Hamming distance ordering methods and their combinations. The experimental evaluation has been performed on an FPS 500 system. Results are analyzed, and it is shown that the preprocessing based on cardinality or its combinations with (2) and/or (3) performs better.<<ETX>>},

title={A dynamic rate control mechanism for integrated networks},
year={1991},
volume={},
number={},
pages={543-552 vol.2},
abstract={To achieve better statistical gain for voice and video traffic and to relieve congestion in integrated networks, a dynamic rate control mechanism is proposed. This mechanism, using a variable rate coder, adjusts the source coding rate based on network feedback information. An analytical model is developed to evaluate the performance of the mechanism for voice traffic. The feedback delay for the source node to obtain the network congestion information is presented in the model. Significant improvement in statistical gain can be realized for smaller capacity links (e.g., links that can accommodate less than 24 calls) with a reasonable feedback time (about 100 ms); but this increase causes a temporary degradation in voice quality to a lower rate. The authors show that whether the feedback delay is exponentially distributed or constant does not significantly affect performance in terms of fractional packet loss and average received coding rate. Using the number of calls in talkspurt or the packet queue length as measures of congestion provides comparable performance.<<ETX>>},

pages={553-559 vol.2},
abstract={Admission control is a tool in the management of the grade of service provided by the network to ongoing connections and new sessions. When the admission decision is based on the clipping loss, the authors model the node load by a Markov modulated point process and show that, if the two conjectures introduced hold, the optimum admission control that guarantees quality for all sessions in the node is of a threshold type. If the conjectures fail to hold, then the result holds for Poisson arrivals. The authors characterize the threshold and show that for the admission decision, the admission controller needs to compare the arrival rate matrices to the threshold. This threshold is based on the partial order on the lattice of arrival rate matrices.<<ETX>>},

year={1991},
volume={},

pages={560-569 vol.2},
abstract={Issues in congestion control are discussed, and a novel congestion control scheme for high-speed networks is described. The scheme is based on periodic transmission of sample time-stamped packets through the network. Upon reception, the packet delays are calculated, averaged, and used to determine the state of the network. The information on the state of the network is then used to drive the network admission control. The major advantage of the proposed scheme over conventional congestion control techniques is that it copes with traffic surges that are shorter than the network round-trip delay. This is achieved by controlling traffic admission with a continuous estimate of the network state. The scheme is targeted towards networks that carry aggregated traffic, and can be applied to ATM-based networks.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A study is made of admission control as a congestion avoidance mechanism in the management of high-speed packet-switched networks under imperfect information. A multi-layer model which can be used for the analysis of ISDN-and B-ISDN-type networks is presented. In this model, traffic requirements at the lower layers result in constraints on the admission policies at the call layer. Using such a model, an examination is made of the effects of noisy estimates on the performance of networks managed via fixed threshold call admission policies. The standard deviation of the collected information concerning the network status serves as a key parameter in representing the complexity, coverage, extensiveness, and cost of the implemented network management and information collecting procedure. For a single-domain network, the effects of Gaussian noise on call blocking, call throughput, packet throughput, and the probability of excess calls are examined in detail. The throughput capacity trajectory is described for fixed packet blocking, packet delay, and probability of excess call constraints.<<ETX>>},

pages={620-627 vol.2},
abstract={A noisy slotted channel is considered. It is assumed that channel feedback might be misinterpreted due to the existence of noise on the channel. Furthermore, this disturbance is dependent on the channel state (either good or bad) which varies from slot to slot according to a Markov chain. Consequently, the occurrence of a channel feedback error is dependent on previous occurrences of errors (i.e., with error memory). Under this assumption, the throughput performance of a random multiple-access algorithm (called a two-cell algorithm) is analyzed, and the result is compared with the throughput of the J. Capetanakis (1979) tree splitting algorithm operating over the same channel. It is shown that the two-cell algorithm retains positive throughputs for all possible values of channel state parameters, and for all practical purposes, it outperforms the Capetanakis algorithm in terms of insensitivity to channel feedback errors.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors introduce a tree protocol with collision detection, which not only significantly improves the throughput and delay performance of the original protocol without collision detection but also obtains a higher throughput and lower delay than Ethernet. In addition, when the channel propagation delay is small, the authors use a modified M/D/1 model to approximate the mean and distribution of the delay performance, and show that such an approximation is in close agreement with the simulation results. Since M/D/1 achieves the lowest delay for all protocols, the delay performance of this protocol is very close to the best delay performance for all random access protocols when the channel propagation delay is small. Two modified protocols are given to resolve the synchronization problems encountered when implementing a multiaccess algorithm.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for computation of time-slot assignments in SS/TDMA (satellite-switched/time-division multiple-access) systems with variable-bandwidth beams. These algorithms are based on modeling the time-slot assignment (TSA) problem as a network-flow problem. If M(N) is the number of uplink (downlink) beams, L is the length of any optimal TSA, and alpha is the maximum bandwidth of an uplink or downlink beam, the sequential algorithm takes O((M+N)/sup 3/ min (M N alpha , L)) time to compute an optimal TSA, when the traffic-handling capacity of the satellite is of the same order as the total bandwidth of the links. The parallel algorithm uses L/2 processors and has a time-complexity of O((M+N)/sup 3/ log L) on a probabilistic random access machine (PRAM) model of parallel computation. The authors then generalize this algorithm to P <or= L/2 processors and describe an efficient implementation of the algorithm on a hypercube multiprocessor with P processors.<<ETX>>},

pages={668-677 vol.2},
abstract={Consideration is given to the scheduling problem for avoiding output conflicts in time-division multiplex (TDM) switching systems. In many applications, if a source transmits a packet to a destination in a frame, it is highly probable that it will also transmit another packet to the same destination in the next frame. So it is not necessary to schedule incoming packets for every frame if all the switching patterns for the nearest scheduled frame can be preserved and the patterns updated appropriately according to changes in traffic demand. An adaptive algorithm of a lower time complexity which assigns time slots to packets according to the changes in traffic demands is given. This algorithm has the worst case time complexity O(N/sup 2/L), where L is the TDM frame length and N is the switch size. Simulation results show that the algorithm is efficient for interdependent traffic and for random traffic.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A study is made of the performance of trunk grouping in packet switch system design, with emphasis on the analysis of maximum throughput, input queue delay and packet loss rate. The trunk grouping technique can be implemented on both sides of the switch. In principle, the output trunk grouping relieves traffic output contentions, while the input trunk grouping proposed prevents individual input links from overloading. The study shows a significant advantage of both input and output trunk groupings in removing local congestions caused by individual links, especially in a highly nonuniform traffic environment. To implement trunk grouping, it is suggested to not designate the connection of each virtual circuit to individual links in high speed network protocol design.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A nonblocking N*N switch for high speed packet switching networks is considered. In practice such a switch may operate L times faster than the input/output trunk. When 1<L<N, the switch would require buffers at input as well as at output ports to keep the packet loss probability and delay within some desirable limits. An analysis is made of the performance of such a switch for an arbitrary amount of buffers per output port and speedup-factor (L). The results show that for a sizable amount of output buffers, the switch with L=3 would perform almost as good as the switch with L=N. For moderate loads, the switch with L=2 can also be implemented. The input buffers are sized according to stringent requirements of packet loss rate.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A report is presented on a queueing analysis and a simulation study of a switch fabric based on a buffered banyan structure whereby buffers are placed at the output links of each switching element. When buffers are located at the input links, it is well known that maximum throughput is limited to approximately 0.45 under a uniform input traffic pattern. This bottleneck is due to the head of the line (HOL) contention at each switching element and is intrinsic to input queueing. The authors propose a buffered banyan switch built from smaller knockout switches which are output-buffered switches. With small knockout switches as the basic switching elements, the complexity of the overall switch fabric is manageable and no internal clock speedup is required. Furthermore, it is shown that with the proposed output-buffered banyan switch, a maximum throughput of 1 can be achieved.<<ETX>>},

A new result in the form of the throughput equation of lower priority packets in a banyan network which is improved by dilation, replication and internal speed-up is presented.

abstract={The authors introduce a class of protocols for integrated voice/data radio networks called the voice/data interleaved-frame fixed-length (VD-IFFL) protocols. The IFFL protocols, which are similar to the interleaved-frame flush-out (IFFO) protocols (a class of schemes developed for data-only applications), except that they have a fixed frame length, a desirable feature in voice communication, are discussed. The VD-IFFL protocols use a movable-boundary mechanism to share the channel between voice and data traffic. Voice traffic is handled on a reservation basis, while data traffic is handled using a hybrid IFFL scheme that combines reservation and contention. These protocols are characterized by infinite Markov chains, whose transition probabilities have been evaluated exactly.<<ETX>>},

pages={732-740 vol.2},
abstract={The authors address the selection of a single packet size for broadband integrated packet networks (e.g., B-ISDN) that carry many traffic types, each with different performance requirements. To meet the requirements of different types of traffic in an integrated network (for example, synchronous stream traffic and delay sensitive bursty traffic, or two different types of synchronous traffic), the probability distribution of the end-to-end network delay must be determined. New insights and procedures for estimating such statistics for store-and-forward integrated packet networks that have a single packet size are presented. In particular, the authors address two problems: determining the required build-out delay to achieve a given packet loss probability for real-time stream traffic (e.g., voice), and determining a packet size that results in the required delay characteristics for delay sensitive traffic (e.g., data for parallel processing applications). The central limit theorem is used to approximate the probability distribution function for the end-to-end packet delay in a network of M/D/1 nodes.<<ETX>>},

In the authors approach, arbitrary performance objectives are defined in the form of cost functions, which map the queueing delay experienced by each packet to a cost incurred. The algorithms, cost-based scheduling (CBS) and cost-based dropping (CBD), then attempt to optimize network performance as perceived by the applications by minimizing the total cost incurred by all packets. Cost functions are presented that are appropriate for the most common applications. Scheduling and dropping algorithms are defined based on these cost functions. It is demonstrated that network performance is better when these heuristic algorithms are used as opposed to the common alternatives.

abstract={A study is made of the effect of correlated packet losses for some simple automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols: go-back- infinity , and Blast. The packet losses are modeled by a two state Markov chain and it is assumed that the round trip delay is random. Expressions are derived for the z-transform and the first and second moments of the time ( tau ), taken to successfully transmit N packets for go-back- infinity and variations of the Blast protocol. For go-back- infinity , bounds are derived for E( tau ), and it is shown that for a fixed mean round trip delay, E( tau ) is minimized when the distribution of the round trip delay is such that its variance is minimized. Some of the protocols investigated show a significant improvement in performance when packet losses occur in bursts. The authors propose and analyze a variation of the Blast protocol which seems particularly suited to bursty packet loss situations.<<ETX>>},

Let p and q denote respectively the probabilities of transition from the quiet state or the noisy state to itself. Numerical results reveal that the classic go-back-N ARQ scheme performs better under Gilbert's model than an independent error model if and only if p+q>or=1.

abstract={A study is made of three dynamic load balancing policies in distributed systems with service interruptions, namely, sender initiated, receiver initiated, and a combination of the two, in different cases: performing and not performing load-balancing functions while the computers are in the middle of interruptions. The policies are analyzed by using decomposition approximation and matrix-geometric solution techniques. Simulations are used to validate the analytical results. The policies are compared to each other and to no load balancing. Sensitivities of the performance to the characteristics of interruptions and design parameters are studied. It is concluded that load balancing has a significant advantage in improving performance. Performing load-balancing functions while the computers are in the middle of interruptions also provides considerable performance improvement.<<ETX>>},

year={1991},
volume={},
number={},
pages={813-821 vol.2},
abstract={Protocol mechanisms are described to locate and correct stale references to a server. In a first round of correction, the protocols do not strive to correct the references atomically, i.e., clients can use the references before correction is completed. This is because locating all references may be difficult and cause unbounded delay since they may be deeply buried in the distributed computations (e.g., a client may have passed a reference to another client). A stale reference which misses the correction is detected upon use and then corrected or handled in an application dependent manner. Such an approach to correction protocols makes them simple, efficient and suitable for different environments. For example, in a large network, the server may notify a correction to the clients by datagram multicast with no guarantee of message delivery. Performance models and supporting data are provided from an implementation. Potential uses of this research are in X500 based implementation of servers.<<ETX>>},

abstract={For integrated networks that support circuit-switched traffic classes with varying bandwidth requirements, an efficient integration of the access control and routing functions is important in realizing optimum network performance. A hierarchical scheme for combined access control and routing is presented for realizing the above objective. The hierarchy comprises two levels; at the lower level each network node implements a distributed call routing strategy, while at the higher level a network supervisor implements an access control policy for minimizing the overall blocking probability. The access control problem to be solved at the supervisor level is formulated in an integer programming framework by a partitioning approach which divides the overall network into several distinct subnets, one corresponding to each bandwidth class. For routing the admitted calls within each subnet in an optimal fashion, a distributed minimum loss routing scheme is developed for implementation at the network nodes. Performance evaluation studies showing the superiority of the various control functions developed are presented.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A Markov Chain based analysis for deflection routing in n-dimensional regular mesh networks is presented. Detailed analyses are given for the 2D mesh, and a generalization to higher dimensions is outlined. Analytic results are shown to agree very closely with simulations. A basic routing scheme in which all packets have equal priority and a priority scheme in which packets with fewer alternative routes are given priority are proposed and analyzed. Results show that the priority scheme gives higher maximum throughput and lower average packet delay than the basic scheme by reducing average deflections under heavy loads. With the priority scheme, the network performance is almost identical to that of the optimal diagonal routing scheme. By doubling the number of links the throughput is always more than doubled. The authors conclude that in the 2D case, bidirectional links are more cost-effective than unidirectional ones assuming the cost is the number of optical transceivers.<<ETX>>},

The allowance for a minimal overhead to be included in multi-segment message transmissions is provided through the use of the continuation-bit approach, while the slot release by destination stations, without increasing the stations latencies, is made possible by having stations keep track of the active message transmissions. This protocol requires few, but not major, changes to the slot format of the DQDB. The performance of the new protocol compares favourably to that of the original DQDB protocol and the DQDB protocol with erasure nodes.<<ETX>>},

abstract={This study deals with the distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) (IEEE 802.6) network, and makes two independent contributions. First, the unfairness problem of DQDB is addressed, and several alternative solutions that can improve the network's fairness are proposed. They include (1) the proportional assignment scheme (PR); (2) the (multiple-request) FCFS (first come first served)-message-queue-based DQDB scheme (MD); and (3) a combination of MD and PR, denoted by MP. Implementation methods that require simple hardware in addition to the regular DQDB interface are outlined. The schemes are compared through simulation, and insights into their characteristics are gained. The performance of these schemes is also compared with that of regular DQDB and bandwidth balancing DQDB. The second contribution is the development of an analytical model of the DQDB network. By employing some constrained assumptions for analytical tractability, a Markov chain model for (an earlier version of) the entire DQDB network is formulated. The model is verified via simulation.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A method is proposed to support confidentiality in broadcast fiber-optic LAN/MAN (local/metropolitan area network) systems. This approach, which is different from the conventional approach, is based on a fundamental property of fiber optics, viz., optical bidirectionality. That is, two distinct transmissions in opposite directions can occur simultaneously on the same channel. This property can be used to arrive at network structures to support privacy in a broadcast environment. The basic idea is that when two stations are engaged in a private conversation, they can effectively jam (or blank out) the reception at all other stations. In this sense, security close to that of point to point links is achieved in a broadcast environment. It is shown that this concept can be successfully applied to LAN/MAN systems, specifically, in the context of DQDB, to the proposed IEEE 802.6 MAN standard. Performance issues in terms of throughput are also discussed.<<ETX>>},

pages={911-918 vol.2},
abstract={In some computer network architectures a process communicates with another process across the network by establishing a virtual circuit. Consider a virtual circuit from node S to node D connected by multiple links. The delay suffered by the packets of the virtual circuit has three components: waiting time or queueing delay, service time or transmission delay, and resequencing delay. The sum of these is called the total delay. The author presents the distribution of the total delay for three different queuing models of node S: G/M/m model, G/M/ infinity model, and M/H/sub K// infinity model.<<ETX>>},

year={1991},
volume={},
number={},
pages={929-938 vol.2},
abstract={This work deals with a general method for buffer design in an ATM system in which the target loss probability should be very low (e.g. less than 10/sup -9/). This method is based on the application of the generalized extreme value theory (GEVT) to results arising from simulation runs. This theory allows the estimation of very small probabilities which would not be evaluable with the traditional Monte Carlo approach. An advantage of 4/5 decades with respect to Monte Carlo limits can be obtained utilizing the same sample set. The extension of the theory to the case of distribution functions of discrete random variables is discussed. The applicability of the method is demonstrated with reference to known probability distribution functions. Moreover, the GEVT is applied in the cases of classical queuing systems. The general criteria for the evaluation of the basic GEVT parameters are discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A high-speed open systems interconnection (OSI) protocol processor is described which is intended for use in LAN adapters. The processor uses recently developed hardware for normal data transfer on layer 2 (LLC class 1), layer 3 (CLNP) and layer 4 (TP4). Connection control and abnormal data transfer (i.e. error handling) of OSI are executed by a general purpose microprocessor. In an experimental system, this processor increased OSI processing speed seven to 12 times over conventional systems. The new processor can therefore significantly improve LAN adapter performance by reducing the overhead associated with OSI processing time.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors consider the conformity property, i.e. that the protocol converters providing communication between different networks meets the service specified by the designer, in constructing protocol converters. Using the top-down approach, an algorithm consisting of the following five steps is proposed to construct a protocol converter: (1) construction of a system graph from the given input; (2) removal of states and transitions that violate the synchronization requirements from the system graph constructed previously; (3) enforcement of liveness requirement on the system graph; (4) verification of the system graph against the service specification; and (5) derivation of a protocol converter from the system graph. The protocol converter so constructed is guaranteed not only to satisfy the conformity property, but also to be free from both deadlock and livelock.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new technique of generating a test sequence for conformance testing of communication protocols is presented. This approach shows that it is possible to generate optimal length test sequences which include multiple unique input output sequences that overlap under certain conditions. In the absence of these conditions, a heuristic technique is used to obtain sub-optimal solutions, which show significant improvement over optimal solutions without overlapping.

abstract={The photonic bus network (PBNet) approach to the design of small backbone networks is considered. The basic building block of PBNets consist of a linear multihop network interconnected in a bidirectional bus virtual topology using point-to-point optical channels. The system is designed to exploit transmissive optical star technology employing multichannel coherent lightwave modulation, but a wavelength-division implementation is also possible. The NCounter Protocol is introduced as a way of achieving fair bandwidth allocation in the presence of network overload conditions. Due to the optical implementation, there is considerable flexibility in PBNet topological design and bandwidth deployment. New design algorithms are introduced for this purpose. Performance results show that substantial improvements in system operation are possible using the proposed design techniques. In addition, the concept of receiver allocation is introduced which permits simple performance evolution of fixed-channel PBNets.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors de Bruijn graphs as logical topologies for multihop lightwave networks. The throughput and delay performance of networks based on de Bruijn graphs are compared with those of shufflenets. It is shown that for a given maximum nodal in- and out-degree and average number of hops between stations, a network based on a de Bruijn graph can support a much larger number of stations than a shufflenet. This increase in the number of stations is obtained at the expense of some nonuniformity in edge loading when the traffic distribution over the source-destination pairs is uniform. In the 1024-node example, this results in a slightly lower throughput for the network based on the de Bruijn graph compared to the shufflenet, but the former has lower delay at low offered loads.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A network is studied in which contention for an outbound link is resolved by assigning to each packet a priority based on its distance to destination and its age (number of misroutes previously suffered). Queueing delay, lost packet performance and network aggregate capacity (saturation throughput) are compared for distance-age prioritization, age-distance prioritization and no prioritization. Results suggest that the lower delay, lower lost packet performance, and high saturation throughputs are offered by distance prioritization. The tails of the probability distribution for the number of hops taken by a representative packet are, however, shorter for age-distance routing. Typical results show that, for a multihop shuffle network with 10240 nodes, the saturation throughput is about 40% higher for distance-age prioritization. For a smaller network with 384 nodes, the improvement falls to 25%.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new media access control (MAC) protocol for ring-topology metropolitan network (MANs) is defined. The destination-stripping dual ring (DSDR) is defined for slotted-medium dual-ring network. The main feature is the destination-stripping capability, which yields a very high throughput through immediate reuse of the slots. It is shown that the protocol can be tailored for different compromises between guaranteed throughput and total throughput. On each of the two rings, guaranteed throughput, with bounded access delay, can be close to twice the medium capacity, and total throughput, under realistic hypotheses, can be close to four times the medium capacity. The maximum interval between accesses by the same station can be as low as N/2 slot times, with N stations on the network. Multicast can be supported with the same simplicity and the same cost as in other LANs and MANs.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new scheme is presented that allows dynamic maintenance, allocation, and release of the isochronous bandwidth in integrated rings. The scheme is flexible since it permits the stations to bundle together several low-speed isochronous channels to form one high-speed isochronous channel. Acquiring isochronous channels by ring stations and releasing them are decentralized, cheap, fast, and simple processes. The overhead bandwidth required by the scheme is negligible. The allocation rate is not affected by the actual load in the ring. The main principle behind the new scheme is to divide the isochronous bandwidth into fixed length slots and to maintain the available channels in each slot as a linked list.<<ETX>>},

Mean waiting time approximations are compared against both simulation results and other results presented in the literature, while the variance approximation is evaluated by comparing it to simulation results only since no other results on variance have been reported so far.

The broadcast and broadcast-with-feedback algorithms presented are functionally equivalent to the broadcast on current LANs, e.g. token-ring or Ethernet. The broadcast algorithms are completely loss free under the asynchronous access method. The broadcast is integrated into the routing mechanism such that it can coexist with any traffic pattern. The time complexity of broadcast on the MetaNet (measured in light-load) is O(log n), while on a ring-based LAN the complexity is n. The algorithms can be modified to serve as a multicast procedure.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The issues of fairness are considered in designing time division multiple access (TDMA) channel access protocols for multihop radio networks. It is shown that there is a limitation as to how fair one can design a channel access protocol for a static multihop radio network. Several fairness measures which are functions of the channel access protocol and the network topology are proposed. It is shown that to find the optimal protocol with respect to any defined fairness measure is NP-hard. Criteria for designing a fair protocol which are independent of the network topology are introduced and their properties are proved. A lower upper bound of one of the measures is found. Two heuristic protocols are developed based on these criteria. Performance comparisons with existing protocols are given.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A novel, distributed topology-control algorithm has been developed for each node in a packet radio network (PRN) to control its transmitting power and logical neighbors in order to construct a reliable, high-throughput topology. The algorithm first constructs a planar triangulation from locations of all nodes as a starting topology. Then, the minimum angles of all triangles in the planar triangulation are maximized by means of edge switching to improve connectivity and throughput. The resulting Delaunay triangulation can be determined locally at each node. The topology is modified by negotiating among neighbors to satisfy a design requirement on the nodal degree parameter. Simulations show that (1) the final topology is degree-bounded, (2) it has a rather regular and uniform structure, and (3) its throughput and reliability are greater than that of a number of alternative topologies.<<ETX>>},

Numerical results are compared for the network performance under receiver-initiated busy-tone multiple access (RI-BTMA) and conservative BTMA (C-BTMA).

abstract={Relaxation of the strict consistency requirements usually found in distributed server architectures is advocated, with emphasis placed instead on the inherent ability of the applications implemented by clients and servers to tolerate inconsistency in the state or deal with the inconsistency in an application dependent manner. For example, inconsistency in name binding information may be detected by a client on attempting to access the named object and corrected by a customized protocol. With such a relaxed consistency, operations on the server state often do not require strict coordination among the group members, and may be realized with weak ordering constraints on group messages. Thus a high degree of concurrency and efficiency is possible without compromising correctness. Sample applications are described to illustrate the use of relaxed consistency in designing distributed servers.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The specification, design and implementation of a text-based multiway interactive conferencing program are presented. The system is described in three parts: the user interface, the distribution mechanism for users' contributions, and the floor control scheme. One specific system of floor control using the formal specification language Z is specified. The separation of the distributed operation of the exchange of speech in the conference from the floor control mechanism has led to the possibility of implementing an open floor conferencing system, and then adding floor control. The only operations necessary to add floor control are those required to allow or prevent use of a channel from each user to any other. The extra state incurred in the conference server processes is the 2-D matrix of user by user channels, with each entry showing allowed/disallowed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new transparent bridging scheme, called the source dependent spanning tree (SDS), is presented in which bridges observe broadcast packets from active hosts to create the shortest path trees for these hosts dynamically. Issues related to packet forwarding in the presence of multiple trees are identified and algorithms for addressing these issues are presented. Some important properties of SDS, such as correctness, are described, and it is compared with previously proposed schemes. Under standard traffic assumptions, it is shown that SDS can achieve load sharing and shortest-path routing without incurring excessive storage and communication overheads.<<ETX>>},

pages={1145-1150 vol.3},
abstract={A preliminary proposal is made for a new approach to connectionless traffic handling in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. The approach is based on available bandwidth information on the virtual path (VP) periodically supplied by the network to the gateway (bandwidth advertising). The knowledge of available bandwidth allows the gateway to inject (with relatively low risk of cell loss) short bursts into the VP pipe immediately, without buffering or prior bandwidth renegotiation. The performance benefits of the proposed scheme with respect to more conventional schemes are evaluated in a simple network example.<<ETX>>},

A hybrid interworking method is proposed that keeps connectionless transfer mode on FDDI and a connection-oriented mode on B-ISDN.

abstract={Motivated by token-passing protocols in LANs, a system of multiple queues, attended by a cyclic server, is considered. The server will switch from the i/sup th/ queue to the next when either K/sub i/ customers are served consecutively or the queue is empty, whichever comes first. Using the pseudoconservation laws, an approximation method is developed to obtain the mean waiting time for each queue. The performance of this approximation is shown to be more robust and accurate then previous heuristic approximations. Further, it is shown to be suitable for modeling token-passing LANs.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A study of multiserver multiqueue systems, i.e., queuing systems comprising a set of waiting lines where customers arrive to be served by a pool of servers, is described. Servers cyclically move from one queue to another, and provide service to at most one waiting customer per visit to a queue. Such (1-limited) multiserver polling models are analyzed. Attention is restricted to the case where the movement of the servers from queue to queue takes place in zero time. Two different server utilization policies are considered, and exact results are presented for the average customer waiting time and delay in the simpler case, while simple upper and lower bounds and a very accurate approximation are proposed for the more complex policy. In both cases systems are assumed to be symmetrical, arrivals are taken to be Poisson, and service times exponential.<<ETX>>},

pages={1196-1205 vol.3},
abstract={The transient behavior of a Markov-modulated Poisson arrival queue is studied under overload control. The queue has finite or infinite buffer capacity with multiple exponential servers. A Markov-modulated Poisson process is used to represent an aggregated voice or video packet arrival process in integrated services networks. With overload control, the arrival process is properly altered once the buffer contents exceed a designated level. The probability distribution of queue length as a function of time is obtained. The temporal effect of the overload control is measured in two forms. While in overload, the amount of time for the queue to fall into underload is measured. While in underload, the amount of time for the queue to rise to overload is measured. A proper design of the control will not only reduce the fall time but also increase the rise time. The transient queuing behavior as affected by time stochastic properties of the underlying Markov chain for the arrival process is also explored.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Routing algorithms based on the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm (DBF) suffer from exponential message complexity in some scenarios. Two modifications to the algorithm are proposed which result in polynomial message complexity without adversely affecting the response time of the algorithm. However, the new algorithms may not compute the shortest path. Instead, the paths computed can be worse than the shortest path by at most a constant factor (<3). The modifications proposed to the original algorithm are simple and easy to implement. The message complexity of the first algorithm, called the multiplicative approximation algorithm, is O(nm log (n Delta )), where Delta is the maximum length over all edges of an n-nodes m-edges network. The message complexity of the second algorithm, called the additive approximation algorithm, is O( Delta / delta nm), where is delta is the minimum length over all edges in the network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The multiobjective routing problem in multiple-class integrated services networks is presented. A multiserver two-class queuing model is introduced, where packets from the first class can be queued, while packets from the other class are blocked when the number of packets in the system exceeds some threshold. Therefore, the first class wants to minimize its average packet delay, while the other class wants to minimize its blocking probability. The resulting multiobjective routing problem is formulated as a Nash game, where each class tries to minimize its own cost function in competition with the other class. The routing policy for a two-server parallel system is derived and the strategy and performance of each class are shown.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An attempt is made to investigate the validity and effectiveness of caching for routing-table lookup in multimedia environments. Multimedia traffic, like voice, data and video, is characterized by the burstiness which is represented in terms of the coefficient of variation. The general expression obtained from an approximate analysis of the cache scheme proposed indicates that the burstiness of traffic has a significant impact on caching performance. If the coefficient of variation of traffic exceeds unity, the demonstrated advantages of caching are significant. The converse is true when the coefficient of traffic is less than unity. The results obtained from simulations show that in the case of data traffic, the demonstrated advantage of caching is dramatic, and in the case of voice traffic, the superiority of caching is moderate. For video traffic, however, caching has less gain due to the smooth nature of video traffic.<<ETX>>},

It is shown that with relatively low hardware overhead, a highly reliable switch fabric can be achieved while maintaining high bandwidth. Maximum fault tolerance is studied by mapping to the marriage problem of graph theory.

abstract={A new class of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching architectures for broadband packet networks, called Shuffleout, is introduced. Its interconnection network is a multistage structure built out of unbuffered 2*4 switching elements. Shuffleout is basically an output-queued architecture in which the number of cells that can be concurrently switched from the inlets to each output queue equals the number of stages in the interconnection network. The switching element operates the cell self-routing adopting a shortest path algorithm which, in case of conflict for interstage links, is coupled with deflection routing. The specific architecture presented is called Closed-Loop Shuffleout, since the cells that cross the whole interconnection network without entering the addressed output queues are lost. The key target of the proposed architecture is coupling the implementation feasibility of a self-routing switch with the desirable traffic performance typical of output queueing.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An address coding mechanism is presented for multicast source routing packets in packet-switched networks. A simple algorithm for processing these address codes at intermediate output link adaptors is presented. It involves only the recognition of a particular link label at the front part of the address code and the stripping off of a front segment of the address code and so can easily be implemented in hardware. Recognizing that the recipients of a multicast packet very often need to respond to the source node, a reverse-path address code is designed that allows individual destination nodes to retrieve the reverse path address without searching the topology database and invoking any route computation program.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A recursive multistage structure for multicast asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching is proposed, based on a connection network with a copying facility and external links connecting the outlets to the inlets. While the network generates only a few copies of an output multicast cell, the remaining are obtained by recycling the output copied cells to the corresponding inputs as many times as necessary. The basic features of a prototype binary multicast switch following the strategy are described. Its performance is also evaluated in terms of throughput and delay, via computer simulation. It is shown that due to the recursive mechanism, the copy generation is spatially distributed in the whole structure and is spread in time. This favorably affects the network's performance.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The time slot assignment problem is studied in time-division multiplexing (TDM) switching systems which can support multicast transmissions. It is shown that this problem is NP-complete, i.e., computationally intractable. Two effective heuristic algorithms are proposed. To evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms, a lower bound on the solution of this problem is derived and computer simulations are performed.

abstract={A new multiple-access scheme for a finite number of stations, called preassigned retransmission slots (PARS), is introduced. The delay-throughput performance of the algorithm has been analyzed under single buffer assumption, and simulated under the infinite buffer assumption. Both performance studies show that the algorithm is stable and performs like slotted-ALOHA in light traffic situations and like time division multiple access (TDMA) in heavy traffic situations. The adaptation to traffic intensity is inherent in the algorithm and no dynamic control of any parameters of the algorithm is needed to achieve this property. Hence, implementation of PARS is much easier than some other algorithms with the same property. It is also shown that in cases in which traffic is not uniformly generated among stations, PARS performs better than TDMA, even in heavy traffic situations.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The concepts of expected drift and first exit time are applied to address the stability issue of a generic p-persistent carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) protocol that includes the nonpersistent and 1-persistent protocols as special cases. Both slotted and nonslotted operations are treated. By utilizing the zero-drift condition as an input-output balance condition, the formidable tasks of specifying the channel load lines and equilibrium contours are avoided in this approach when assessing the stability performance of a persistent CSMA/CD system. Also characterized is the packet output of the process of the generic p-persistent CSMA/CD protocol under a finite population model. Explicit expressions are provided for calculating the first moment of the packet interdeparture time so that the channel throughput and packet delay can be easily evaluated.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new collision-avoiding protocol, the receiver-and-transmitter (R&T) code-sensing protocol, is formulated and its performance upper bounds are numerically analyzed. The results reveal that a high throughput and a stable performance of a distributed code-division multiple-access (CDMA) packet radio network can be achieved by broadcasting both transmitter and receiver codes into the shared CDMA channel to avoid possible packet conflicts. To measure the efficiency of the orthogonal codes used, the effective code utilization (ECU), defined as the ratio between the throughput and code consumption, is introduced and evaluated. The evaluation shows that the R&T code-sensing protocol has an ideal ECU.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A continuous-time Markov chain model for an asynchronous spread spectrum packet radio network is presented. The network consists of N fully connected nodes, and the radios in all nodes are identical. Packets arrive at each node and are retransmitted when lost, both according to Poisson processes with different rates, and packet lengths are exponential in distribution. A simple threshold approximation is used to account for the multiuser interference, and the preamble collision probability at receiving radios to account for the capture effect. The approximate analysis gives good results in most cases, and overestimates the throughput when packets are frequently lost on account of the multiuser interference or the preamble collisions. The network stability conditions are discussed and the bistable behavior of the network is demonstrated. Results show the effects on throughput and packet delay performance of the network according to the variations of the network size, the packet transmission rate, the preamble collision probability at receiving radios, and the threshold value of the radio channel.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An internetwork of LANs is modeled as a graph with LAN segments as edges and transparent bridges and repeaters as nodes. The graph model leads to a simple expression for the effective load on an arbitrary LAN segment, which takes into account the overhead traffic due to the learning mechanism of the transparent bridges. Simplifying assumptions for the operation of the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol lead to a simple expression of the average end-to-end delay in terms of the effective loads on the LAN segments. The problem of optimally locating bridges and repeaters on the nodes in order to minimize the average delay is studied. This problem is equivalent to the set partitioning problem which can be readily solved with state-of-the-art algorithms. Minimizing cost subject to a constraint on average end-to-end delay is discussed. Locating bridges and repeaters on a linear topology, as typically found in an office building with a large number of floors, is also studied.<<ETX>>},

abstract={In order to study the interactions between LANs and proposed interconnection networks, a high time-resolution hardware monitor for Ethernet LANs is presented that avoids the shortcomings of previous monitoring tools, such as traffic burst clipping and timestamp jitter. Using data recorded by a monitor for several hundred million Ethernet packets, an overview of the short-range time correlations in external LAN traffic is presented. The analysis shows that LAN traffic is extremely bursty across time domains spanning six orders of magnitude. This behavior is compared with simple formal traffic models. The results suggest that the pronounced short-term traffic correlations, together with the extensive time regime of traffic burstiness, strongly influence the patterns of loss and delay induced by LAN interconnection.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Congestion control mechanisms are required in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks to fairly and efficiently allocate network resources to the various service types. Bandwidth assignment is a preventive control mechanism. A bandwidth called equivalent bandwidth is allocated in order to ensure the cell transport objectives. A definition is proposed of equivalent bandwidth for stream, bursty data and variable bit rate video sources. The equivalent bandwidth values are evaluated by simulation considering both homogeneous and heterogeneous sources. In the heterogeneous mixes with different cell loss probability requirements the selective discarding mechanism permits a more efficient utilization of the network resources.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new multilink concept, called string mode, is presented that can be used in an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network to balance the load and thereby increase the efficiency of the network. Performance evaluation shows an efficiency improvement of about 50% when the concept is used with bursty sources with a relatively high peak bitrate. Two different chopper algorithms are investigated, one is distributing strings in cyclic order, while the other uses a uniform random distribution. Results show that a better performance can be obtained by using cyclic distribution. However, cyclic distribution requires a counter for every source to store information about the previous selected links, while a random generator used to determine the next output link can be a shared resource for a number of sources.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Overload control in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks is dealt with via priority cell discarding mechanisms governed by a set of nested queue fill thresholds. An efficient search technique is developed which is applicable to any number of discarding priorities for determining the set of thresholds that optimize the offered load when constraints on cell loss (discarding) probabilities are specified. Results are presented as a function of queue capacity for given traffic distribution and arrival statistics. The results indicate that nested threshold discarding systems can support significantly higher traffic loads than systems without priorities. The sensitivity of the performance advantage to traffic mix and cell loss constraints is also illustrated. The efficient search procedure is shown to provide substantial computational gain when there are more than two discarding priorities.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The pros and cons are discussed of synchronous and isochronous service in FDDI-II, which is an enhanced version of the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) protocol. The results make clear that basic FDDI meets the requirements imposed by traditional LAN applications. To overcome the problem of throughput degradation and increasing delays for asynchronous traffic in applications with large fiber length and hard response time requirements, FDDI-II is defined as a promising upward-compatible extension. It is shown that from a performance point of view FDDI-II is an excellent candidate for complex communications environments. This protocol integrates both circuit switched and packet switched services in an efficient way. The results show that, in environments with upcoming hard real-time requirements, changing to the enhanced protocol, i.e., changing from basic FDDI to FDDI-II, is a much better way to meet the demands than to push the old protocol to its limits.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A class of discrete-time priority queueing systems with Markov modulated arrivals is considered. In these systems, N queues are served by a single server according to priorities that are preassigned to the queues. Packet arrivals are modeled as discrete-time batch processes with a distribution that depends on the state of an independent common two-state Markov chain. This allows coverage of a wide range of applications in computer and communication systems when the parameters of the arrival processes are not fixed in time but vary according to the state of the underlying Markov chain. The steady-state joint generating functions of the queue length distributions of this class of systems are derived. From these, moments of the queue lengths as well as average time delays can be obtained. A numerical example provides some insight into the behavior of such systems. Also, the effect of the transition rate between the states of the modulating Markov chain on the average time delay in the system is investigated for different patterns of loads on the queues of the system.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A general solution methodology is provided for analysis of multi-media traffic queues. An efficient algorithm for a class of quasi-birth-death (QBD) processes, which are very versatile in formulating multi-media traffic queues, is described. Based on the Markov chain reduction principle, the algorithm exploits structural property to overcome the difficulties caused by the extraordinarily large state space of the model. It is stable, accurate and efficient for handling very large-scale problems. Applications of the algorithm to analysis of multi-media traffic queues with finite buffer and multilevel overload controls are emphasized. Two continuous time QBD models are devised for the applications. Model 1 extends the finite M/M/1 queue with Markov-modulated Poisson arrivals. Model II is the Markovian version of the continuous fluid-flow model. Both queue distribution and packet loss rate are measured. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through analysis of various design and control issues in multi-media traffic integrations.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Packet blocking in the multiclass M/G/1/B queueing systems is studied by rate conservation methods. It is assumed that two classes of traffic are accessing the queue. Recursive forms are obtained for the packet loss probability and conditional probability of consecutive blocking for class one traffic, with the other class modeling the background traffic. The latter characterizes the distribution of the number of consecutively class one packets blocked. It is shown that these quantities depend essentially on the joint distribution of the queue length and the residual service time. This joint distribution is recursively computed by analyzing, through rate conservation principles, the embedded queue at arrival times.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The design issues of a multimedia transport protocol, TP5, which achieves the multiplexing of both real time and normal data flows at the transport layer are discussed. The use of a single transport connection to carry both data flows is proposed. Two schemes for the support of the synchronization of these data flows are presented. The protocol TP5 implementing the above mechanisms is described. It is shown that with the use of the described synchronization schemes, the TP5 protocol minimizes the control of the real time traffic while still controlling the normal data flow.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A generalization of the multiple access problem is considered where it is necessary to identify a subset of the ready users, not all. The problem is motivated by several response collection applications that arise in distributed computing and database systems. In these applications, a collector is interested in gathering a set of responses from a number of potential respondents. The collector and respondents communicate over a shared channel. Three collection objectives are defined, and a suite of protocols that can be used to achieve these objectives is investigated. The protocols are based on the use of polling, time division multiple access (TDMA) and group testing. Using a binomial respondent model, the performance of the protocols is analyzed and, where possible, optimized. The main concern is with cost measures that reflect the computational load placed on the system, as well as the delay incurred for achieving a particular objective.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Two-phase algorithms are devised to assign and reassign spread-spectrum codes to transmitters, to receivers, and to pairs of stations in a large dynamic packet radio network (PRN) using code-division multiple access (CDMA). The algorithms minimize the time complexity in the first phase and minimize the number of control packets needed to be exchanged in the second phase. A new pairwise code-assignment scheme is proposed to assign codes to edges. Simulations based on well-controlled topologies (sparse topologies) show that the proposed scheme requires much fewer codes than transmitter-based code assignment, while maintaining throughput performance.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A protocol for a multiuser very high-speed optical data network based on a passive star topology is presented and analyzed. The users' traffic is assumed to be bursty as in the case of computer communications. Tunable transmitters and receivers which are capable of tuning to N+1 relatively stable wavelengths are required to be cross-connected via a passive optical star coupler to the other users of the network. One of the N+1 wavelengths is used to provide the switching information to the receivers and the others are used for actual data transmission. The protocol employs the pure ALOHA random access scheme on the control channel and the slotted-CSMA (carrier sense multiple access). Numerical results for different values of wavelength number, propagation delay time and data packet length show that for large ratios of the length of a data packet to a control packet and for heavy traffic conditions, the protocol achieves a higher throughput and causes much less delay.<<ETX>>},
