abstract={Two protocols for scheduling variable-length packet transmissions in an optical passive star network using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) are specified and analyzed. These protocols require: a separate channel for transmission of control packets, a fixed transmitter and receiver and a tunable transmitter and receiver. The distinction between these protocols and other WDM protocols is that message transmissions are initiated by the receipt of a control message; other schemes schedule packet transmission for some fixed point in the future. This flexibility allows these protocols to avoid "head-of-line" blocking which is a problem encountered in some other protocols. The protocols presented place no constraints on the size of a message, the size of a packet or on the number of available data channels; maintain a distributed queue for each of the output nodes; and guarantee that there are no receiver or data channel collisions. The delay characteristics of these protocols are analyzed and compared to those of the TTAS algorithm.},

abstract={This paper presents a media access protocol designed for LIGHTING, a WDM testbed currently under construction which has been designed for high-performance supercomputer interconnection. The architecture is based on a dynamically reconfigurable hierarchical WDM network that is being constructed to interconnect a large number of supercomputers and create a distributed shared memory (DSM) environment. This paper describes the network media access protocol based on a single tunable transmitter and single tunable receiver (TT-TR) per node. The protocol exploits the bimodal traffic characteristics of a DSM system. The primary objectives of the protocol design are reduced average latency per packet, support of broadcast/multicast, and support of collisionless communication. The proposed approach is compared to an earlier protocol based on one tunable transmitter and one fixed receiver (TT-FR) per node. The performance of the protocol in terms of average latency and channel utilization is analyzed for varying system characteristics such as number of nodes and channels.},

abstract={This paper examines wavelength translation in all-optical wavelength-routed networks. Previous studies have shown that wavelength translation can improve the blocking performance of these networks. However, all the previous work has assumed that wavelength translators can translate from any input wavelength to any output wavelength. In contrast, all-optical wavelength translators demonstrated in the laboratory to date are, in general, only capable of limited translation. We assess, for the first time, the network performance improvements offered by realistic all-optical wavelength translators with a limited translation range. In particular, we consider all-optical wavelength translators based on four-wave mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers. Using a simple model for their function, we consider the blocking performance of two-hop and multiple-hop paths, and unidirectional ring and mesh-torus networks. In all the cases we consider, significant improvement in the blocking performance of the network is obtained when limited-range wavelength translators with as little as one quarter of the full range an introduced. We also find that almost all of the network performance improvement observed by an ideal wavelength translator can be gained from a translator with only half of the full translation range.},

abstract={ATM network design and optimization at the call-level may be formulated in the framework of multirate, circuit-switched, loss networks with effective bandwidth encapsulating cell-level behavior. Each service supported on the ATM network is characterized by a rate or bandwidth requirement. Future networks will be characterized by links with very large capacities in circuits and by many rates. Various asymptotic results are given to reduce the attendant complexity of the numerical calculations. A central element is a uniform asymptotic approximation (UAA) for link analyses. Moreover, a unified hybrid approach is given which allows asymptotic and nonasymptotic (exact) methods of calculations to be used cooperatively. Network loss probabilities are obtained by solving fixed point equations. A canonical problem of route and logical network design is considered. An optimization procedure is proposed, which is guided by gradients obtained by solving a system of equations for implied costs. Finally, we report numerical results obtained by the software package TALISMAN, which incorporates the theoretical results. The network considered has 8 nodes, 20 links, 6 services and as many as 160 routes.},

abstract={Broadband network are developed to carry a wide range of traffic which has different characteristics and grade-of-service (GoS) requirements. To meet these distinct requirements, we propose to decompose each network component into multiple sub-components. Each sub-component has a dedicated bandwidth and buffer, and it only carries traffic which has a similar GoS requirement. Thus it will reduce the interference from other types of traffic which has totally different GoS requirements. First, we develop a GoS-based pricing scheme which will entail the resources are efficiently utilized. The equilibrium stability is also studied. Then we address the problem of how to optimally allocate available resources among the sub-components. Resource expansion becomes necessary when the network is congested. Two kinds of routing schemes are proposed. One is least cost routing for GoS-insensitive traffic and the other is best GoS routing for GoS-sensitive traffic.},

abstract={We present a framework for the modeling of multipath routing in connectionless networks that dynamically adapt to network congestion. The basic routing protocol uses a short-term metric based on hop-by-hop credits to reduce congestion over a given link, and a long-term metric based on end-to-end path delay to reduce delays from a source to a given destination. A worst-case bound on the end-to-end path delay is derived under three architectural assumptions: each router adopts weighted fair queueing (or packetized generalized processor sharing) service discipline on a per destination basis, a permit-bucket filter is used at each router to regulate traffic flow on a per destination basis, and all paths are loop free. The shortest multipath routing protocol regulates the parameters of the destination-oriented permit buckets and guarantees that all portions of a multipath are loop free.},

abstract={One of the most challenging problems in ATM network design is providing diversified quality of service (QoS) to applications with distinct characteristics. A flexible priority service policy for two applications (classes) with strict-and in general distinct-deadlines and different deadline violation rates (loss rates) is studied. The proposed policy is a generalization of the shortest time to extinction (STE) policy (or the early-due-date policy which discards expired cells). The relationship of this policy to other standard ones is also discussed. Performance measures such as cell loss, mean cell-delay and the tail of the cell-delay probability distribution are derived for each class. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the studied priority scheme. Finally, a low-complexity implementation scheme is proposed, which does not require time-stamp-based sorting.},

abstract={A major challenge in integrated services packet networks is the design of packet multiplexing systems to support different QoS requirements. We focus on the problem of satisfying different loss requirements. In time-slotted multiplexing systems, one may have batch arrivals (i.e., simultaneous arrivals in a time slot), and it is necessary to reject some of the packets in a batch when there is an insufficient number of available buffers. We propose a simple and intelligent probabilistic mechanism for rejecting packets in order to meet the loss requirements. It may be used as a selective discard mechanism to provide different QoS levels in terms of loss (weighted fair blocking). It may also be used to achieve fairness (balanced fair blocking). It offers important advantages and gains relative to existing approaches while being very simple. It allows decoupling of buffer dimensioning from the parameterization of a discard mechanism. It is universal in the sense that it may be used on top of many discrete-time multiplexing schemes. It also reduces the buffer space needed to meet loss requirements compared to natural rejection methods such as random selection. The mechanism is derived explicitly for two Markov modulated Bernoulli sources. The derivation for an arbitrary number of Bernoulli sources is formulated as a linear programming problem.},

abstract={In transport-layer protocols such as TCP over ATM networks, a packet is discarded when one or more cells are lost in that packet, and the destination node then requires its source to retransmit the corrupted packet. Therefore, once one of the cells constituting a packet is lost, the subsequent cells of the corrupted packet waste network resources. Thus, discarding those cells will enable us to efficiently utilize the network resources and improve the packet loss probability. We focus on tail dropping (TD) and early packet discard (EPD) as selective cell discard schemes which force the switches to discard some of the arriving cells instead of relaying them. We exactly analyze the packet loss probability in a system applying these schemes. Their advantage and limits are then discussed based on numerical results derived through the analysis.},

abstract={In high-speed communication networks such as the ATM-based B-ISDN, a frequently addressed issue in traffic management is how to effectively manage network resources to meet different quality of service (QoS) requirements of multiple traffic streams. We consider a measurement-based loss scheduling scheme, termed the QoS-scheme, for high-speed packet networks. We show that the QoS-scheme is optimal in terms of bandwidth utilization among all stationary, space conserving loss scheduling schemes, and that it is also optimal among all stationary loss schemes when all traffic streams are equally demanding. We examine the properties of the QoS-scheme and how these properties may be used to compute the minimum bandwidth required for a given traffic scenario. We also discuss the implications of these properties and compare the QoS-scheme with other loss scheduling schemes such as the last-in-first-out, partial buffer sharing, and push-out scheme through simulation studies.},

abstract={We present an adaptive network layer protocol for VBR video transport. It: (1) minimizes the buffer requirement in the network while guaranteeing that packets of VBR encoded video flows will not be lost, and (2) minimizes the end-to-end delay and jitter of frames. To achieve the former objective, we utilize a receiver-oriented adaptive credit-based flow control algorithm, and derive the necessary and sufficient number of buffers that should be reserved for ensuring its reliability. To minimize the end-to-end delay and jitter for VBR encoded video streams, we: (1) present bandwidth estimation techniques which exploit the structure of the video traffic, and (2) define a new fairness criteria for buffer allocation and then present a fair buffer/bandwidth allocation algorithm. We experimentally evaluate this protocol for a wide range of parameters and many network configurations, and demonstrate its adaptability. We also compare the performance of the protocol with numerous other schemes and demonstrate its suitability for video transport.},

abstract={Current solutions to providing statistical performance guarantees to bursty traffic such as compressed video encounter several problems: (1) source traffic descriptors are often too simple to capture the burstiness and important time-correlations of VBR sources or too complex to be used for admission control algorithms; (2) stochastic descriptions of a source are inherently difficult for the network to enforce or police; (3) multiplexing inside the network's queues may change the stochastic properties of the source in an intractable way, precluding the provision of end-to-end QoS guarantees to heterogeneous sources with different performance requirements. We present a new approach to providing end-to-end statistical performance guarantees that overcomes these limitations. We term the approach hybrid bounding interval dependent (H-BIND) because it uses the deterministic-BIND traffic model to capture the correlation structure and burstiness properties of a stream; but unlike a deterministic performance guarantee, it achieves a statistical multiplexing gain (SMG) by exploiting the statistical properties of deterministically-bounded streams. Using traces of MPEG-compressed video, we show that the H-BIND scheme can achieve average network utilizations of up to 86% in a realistic scenario.},

title={A bandwidth allocation protocol for MPEG VBR traffic in ATM networks},
year={1996},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1100-1107 vol.3},
abstract={A periodic allocation protocol, called anticipated traffic allocation protocol (ATAP) for real time VBR traffic is proposed. The main objective of this protocol is to dynamically allocate the available bandwidth to real-time VBR sources, i.e. to be more efficient than the CBR allocation and at the same time more secure that the "walk-in" allocation. The ATAP unit is located at the network entry node between the real-time encoder and the applied bandwidth allocation protocol in the network, the fast reservation protocol FRP/DT. This reservation protocol cannot satisfy the real-time requirements, since the source would have to wait at least a round trip delay to reserve a required bandwidth increase. Hence, the ATAP proposes to anticipate and allocate the bandwidth one period in advance. This permits the encoder to adjust its coding bit rate according to the network loading condition. Doing so, a congestion will gracefully degrade the subjective quality of the signal, instead of "blindly" loosing cells at the network entry node. A minimum bit rate negotiated at the connection set-up is always guaranteed to assure the connection continuity in the case of the case of bandwidth reservation refusal. On the network side, the ATAP interacts with the FRP/DT. Reservation failures are used as congestion indicators to control the entering traffic and to adjust the cell priority. A simulation analysis investigates the performance of the ATAP and its interaction with the FRP/DT for two real MPEG VBR audio sequences under different bit rate anticipation approaches.},

abstract={We consider connection-oriented wireless cellular networks. Such second generation systems are circuit-switched digital networks which employ dedicated radio channels for the transmission of signaling information. A forward signaling channel is a common signaling channel assigned to carry the multiplexed stream of paging and channel-allocation packets from a base station to the mobile stations. Similarly, for ATM wireless networks, paging and virtual-circuit-allocation packets are multiplexed across the forward signaling channels as part of the virtual-circuit set-up phase. The delay levels experienced by paging and channel-allocation packets are critical factors in determining the efficient utilization of the limited radio channel capacity. A multiplexing scheme operating in a "slotted mode" can lead to reduced power consumption at the handsets, but may in turn induce an increase in packet delays. Focusing on forward signaling channels, we present schemes for multiplexing paging and channel-allocation packets across these channels, based on channelization plans, access priority assignments and paging group arrangements. For such multiplexing schemes, we develop analytical methods for the calculation of the delay characteristics exhibited by paging and channel-allocation packets. The resulting models and formulas provide for the design and analysis of forward signaling channels for wireless network systems.},

abstract={Packet radio networks are modeled as arbitrary graphs by most researchers. We show that an arbitrary graph is an inaccurate model of the radio networks. This is true because there exists a large class of graphs which will not model the radio networks. Radio networks can be modeled accurately by a restricted class of graphs called the planar point graphs. Since the radio networks can accurately be modeled only by a restricted class of graphs, the NP-completeness results for scheduling using an arbitrary graph as the model, do not correctly reflect the complexity of the problem. We study the broadcast scheduling problem using the restricted class as the model. We show that the problem remains NP-complete even in this restricted domain. We give an O(nlogn) algorithm when all the transceivers are located on a line. We restrict our attention to static allocation in general and TDMA in particular. However, it may be noted that the results presented are also valid for other static allocation schemes.},

abstract={Transmitting multimedia data over a CDMA channel presents a new set of challenges. Sometimes, data demands will exceed the system capacity, in which case the system must make the most efficient use of its limited resources. The resources we consider are: fixed bandwidth available for each user and the transmit power budget for each cell. We present our approach for unifying power control, variable forward error correction (VFEC), and scheduling for allocating the system resources. Our objective is to maximize the overall system satisfaction, which we call "system utility". This objective is achieved by applying a distributed algorithm which divides the overall optimization problem into a hierarchy of three levels (system, cell and user). At each level, the system performs independent and parallel optimizations; the critical information is then passed to the higher level for further optimization. Finally, an iterative and distributed algorithm is applied at the system level to achieve the overall system optimization.},

pages={1133-1140 vol.3},
abstract={Unlike wired networks, packets transmitted on wireless channels are often subject to burst errors which cause back to back packet losses. Most wireless LAN link layer protocols recover from packet losses by retransmitting lost segments. When the wireless channel is in a burst error state, most retransmission attempts fail thereby causing poor utilization of the wireless channel. Furthermore, in the event of multiple sessions sharing a wireless link, FIFO packet scheduling can cause the HOL blocking effect, resulting in unfair sharing of the bandwidth. This observation leads to a new class of packet dispatching methods which explicitly take the wireless channel characteristics into consideration in making packet dispatching decisions. We compare a variety of channel state dependent packet (CSDP) scheduling methods with a view towards enhancing the performance of the transport layer sessions. Our results indicate that by employing a CSDP scheduler at the wireless LAN device driver level, significant improvement in the channel utilization can be achieved in typical wireless LAN configurations.},

We define a new type of state identification sequence, called context independent unique sequence (CIUS) and present an algorithm for computing it. A unified method based on CIUSes is developed for automatically generating executable test cases for both control flow and data flow aspects of an EFSM. In control flow testing, CIUSes are very useful in confirming the tail state of the transitions. In data flow testing, CIUSes improve the observability of the test cases for the def-use associations of different variables used in the EFSM. Unlike general state identification sequences, the use of CIUSes does not increase the complexity of the already intractable feasibility problem in the test case generation.},

abstract={Protocol software is often difficult and expensive to implement and test in today's computing environments. Several things are done to reduce this difficulty: communications software is subdivided into layers and organized into a protocol graph; communications software is developed within a protocol or networking subsystem; and it is often ported rather than developed from scratch. Today, a multitude of subsystems offer different features, functionality, and drawbacks; the differences among them often reduce portability and efficiency of protocol code. We consider these differences in subsystems and their effect on the portability and performance of protocol implementations. We propose an approach for combining the better features of protocol subsystems by constructing protocol graphs composed of protocols residing in different subsystems. Our approach uses adapter modules spanning the inter-subsystem boundary. We relate our experiences designing, implementing, and measuring the performance of several such adapters using an AppleTalk protocol stack we have developed as a baseline.},

abstract={The trend toward the enrichment of communication services in ISDN and IN has greatly increased the size and complexity of communication protocols which realize the services. A large and complex protocol is constructed by integrating components, each of which corresponds to a subfunction specified in a service specification. The conventional approach to this construction is to integrate components on the protocol level using the existing protocol integration methods. In this approach, the reachability analysis of protocol components is required in the integration stage. So if the size of components becomes large, the integration stage would be a bottleneck because of the state explosion problem of the reachability analysis. Therefore, we propose a new approach to construct the target protocol which, at first integrates components on the service specification level and then transforms an integrated service specification into the target protocol by the protocol synthesis technique. As a result, the construction of the target protocol from the component service specifications can be efficiently effected in a small state space without paying special attention to the timing of protocol messages.},

In other words, we propose a good compromise between the expressiveness power of the service specification model and the synthesis power. An important aspect which characterizes our approach is that the synthesis is based on stepwise refinement rules. This gives it the ability to be an extensible approach.},

We show that a source policy which defers increases in the explicit rate for a period of time, while allowing decreases to take effect immediately maintains the requirement of feasibility. We also examine the convergence properties of the end-to-end rate based schemes in general, and give an upper bound on the convergence time of the scheme presented.},

abstract={In ATM networks congestion control plays an essential role in supporting different quality of service guarantees for a large variety of traffic types. While for real-time communications, such as CBR and VBR services, a preventive open-loop congestion control mechanism is applied, a reactive closed-loop mechanism has been suggested for the ABR service class, which was introduced aiming at data communication applications. This paper presents a performance analysis of the rate-based congestion control mechanism developed by the ATM Forum. Using a differential equation approach for the computation of the evolution of the allowed cell rate and the buffer content during the steady state, we derive closed-form expressions to estimate the maximum buffer lengths. These expressions can be formulated for steady-state conditions as well as for transient phases. In our approach, scenarios with and without priority for the resource management cells are considered. From numerical examples we conclude that an appropriate setting of the control parameters is important achieving a reasonable performance of the rate-based control mechanism. In particular, we are interested in limiting the required buffer size while enabling a fast reaction to changes of the available transmission capacity.},

abstract={One of the challenges for rate based congestion management for computer communication networks is that of scalability. This is true especially in the context of ATM, when reducing the amount of state maintained and the computation performed can have significant advantages in making switches fast as well as low-cost. We explore ways of achieving better scalability of explicit rate algorithms for maxmin fair rate allocation in the presence of a large number of flows/virtual connections. We seek ways to reduce the complexity in both the amount of state that individual switches have to maintain, and the computation performed, by introducing the idea of discrete source rates. We develop algorithms with O(k) complexity of the calculation of fair allocation at the switch, where k is the number of distinct rates. We reduce the amount of state information to one bit per flow without performance degradation. We suggest a further approximation requiring only O(k) state information which performs quite well in our simulations, although it is shown to be vulnerable to certain conditions which may lead to somewhat lower link utilization.},

abstract={The paper considers medium access control protocols for all-optical packet networks based on WDM multichannel ring topologies where nodes are equipped with one fixed-wavelength receiver and one wavelength-tunable transmitter. Such networks provide separate channels for slotted transmissions to disjoint subsets of destination nodes. Some simple access protocols based on local status information are described. Since these protocols are not able to enforce fairness by themselves, fairness control algorithms derived from those adopted in the Metaring high-speed metropolitan area network are also proposed. Analytical and simulation results are presented to assess the capacity of the proposed protocols in uniform traffic conditions, with a particular focus on the case where at each node the packet to be transmitted is randomly selected. In spite of the simplicity of the proposed access schemes, numerical results show that good performance can be achieved and the fairness problems inherent in the considered network topologies can be overcome.},

abstract={We consider the problem of scheduling packet transmissions in single-hop WDM networks, with tunability provided only at one end. Our objective is to design schedules of minimum length for a given traffic demand matrix. The contribution of our work is twofold. First we define a special class of schedules which permit an intuitive formulation of the scheduling problem. We then present algorithms which construct schedules of length equal to the lower bound provided that certain optimality conditions are satisfied. We also develop heuristics which, in the general case, give schedules of length equal or very close to the lower bound. Secondly, we identify two distinct regions of network operation. In the first region the schedule length is determined by the tuning requirements, while in the second it is determined by the traffic demands. The point at which the network switches between the two regions is identified in terms of the number of nodes and channels, and the tuning latency. Accordingly, we show that it is possible to appropriately dimension the network to offset the effects of even large values of tuning latency.},

abstract={Based on the POPSMAC protocol proposed in Chung-Sheng Li et al. (1993), we propose an improved medium access protocol for wavelength division multiple access (WDMA) photonic networks. Using the same set of photonic devices as in POPSMAC, the proposed protocol alleviates the drawbacks of the POPSMAC protocol, e.g., invalid data transmissions following receiver collisions and possible acknowledgement packet collisions with header/data packets, while retaining many advantages of POPSMAC. As a result, the network performance in terms of the throughput and the packet delay is improved. Analytical models based on the timing diagram analysis, the continuous-time Markov chain, and the randomization technique are developed to assess the performance of the proposed protocol. The performance is evaluated in terms of channel utilization, mean packet delay, and packet delay distribution with variations in the number of nodes, the offered traffic, the size of data packets, and the network propagation delay. Numerical results show that the proposed protocol achieves better channel utilization and incurs lower packet delays than POPSMAC.},

abstract={This paper investigates the performance of media access protocols based on on-line scheduling for an optically connected star-coupled system with wavelength division multiple access channels. Hybrid access protocols combining reservation and pre-allocation of receiver channels have been previously proposed. Transmission consisted of a reservation phase followed by a data phase. Each node was allowed to place a reservation for one WDM channel. This protocol is extended in this paper by allowing reservations on multiple channels and using simple on-line scheduling algorithms. Existing scheduling algorithms (all are off-line) for similar reservation problems tend to have high implementation and computational complexity. We require that scheduling algorithms be real-time and amenable to hardware implementation. The performance of the extended protocol incorporating two simple on-line scheduling algorithms is presented in this paper. We show that the slight increased computational overhead with scheduling is justified by reduced packet latency and higher utilization, especially for client-server traffic.},

title={The drop from front strategy in TCP and in TCP over ATM},
year={1996},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1242-1250 vol.3},
abstract={This paper proposes the use of a "drop from front" scheme for improving TCP performance in high bandwidth-delay product networks. In particular, for "TCP over ATM" we compare the performance when drop from front is used at the output port of ATM switches with the performance under tail drop, its variations, and with variations of random early detection (RED). In drop from front, when a cell arrives at a full buffer, the cell closest to being transmitted is dropped, thus creating space for the arriving cell. This policy causes duplicate acknowledgements to be sent one whole buffer drain time earlier than is the case under tail drop. These quicker duplicate acknowledgements cause TCP with fast retransmit to recognize losses faster and invoke congestion control actions earlier than would be the case under tail drop. This earlier reaction translates into considerable performance improvement. Hence, drop from front successfully utilizes the ability of TCP with fast retransmit to quickly recognize and react to congestion information (at the third repeat acknowledgement, as opposed to time-out). Roughly, the earlier action by the sources causes the congestion not to grow quite as severe, which prevents later over-reaction by the sources, and thus increases throughput.},

pages={1251-1260 vol.3},
abstract={A number of proposals for supporting the Internet protocol (IP) over ATM are under discussion in the networking community including: LAN emulation, classical IP over ATM, routing over large clouds, and multiprotocol over ATM. Each of these proposals hides the real network topology from the IP layer by treating the data link layer as a large, opaque, network cloud. We argue that this leads to complexity, inefficiency and duplication of functionality in the resulting network. We propose an alternative in which we discard the connection oriented nature of ATM and integrate fast ATM hardware directly with the IP, presenting the connectionless nature of the IP. We use a "soft" state in the ATM hardware to cache the IP forwarding decision. This enables further traffic on the same IP flow to be switched by the ATM hardware rather than forwarded by the IP software. We claim that this approach combines the simplicity, scalability, and robustness of the IP with the speed, capacity, and multiservice traffic capabilities of ATM.},

abstract={To extend the widespread use of the high performance parallel interface (HIPPI) as a networking solution for high-speed communications, the 25-meter distance limitation must be solved. Three options available for alleviating the problem of distance limitation are serial-HIPPI, HIPPI/SONET mapping or HIPPI-ATM mapping, and IP routing. Serial-HIPPI, HIPPI/SONET mapping and HIPPI-ATM mapping provide extended HIPPI connectivities at the physical layer, while IP routing forwards data between the HIPPI networks and other networks at the network layer. We study two feasible solutions of this problem, HIPPI tunneling (HIPPI-ATM mapping) and IP routing. We compare these two schemes in terms of network connectivities, protocol overhead, and flow control. The performance evaluation of one implementation of HIPPI tunneling and IP routing is presented. The experimental performance suggests that a high degree of bandwidth utilization was achieved by both HIPPI tunneling and IP routing in this implementation.},

abstract={In multichannel telecommunication networks, switching systems and processor-memory interconnects the need for conflict-free traffic assignment arises whenever packets (or requests) are to be directed from input buffers (processors) to specific outlets (modules). We present an algorithm, based on forward planning, which can be used in the above-mentioned applications for scheduling conflict-free transfers of packets from inputs to outputs. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in the sense of throughput and delay, and compared with that of the system of distinct representatives (SDR), an earlier proposed algorithm featuring 100% assignment efficiency. Then, its worst case computational complexity is compared with that of SDR and several suboptimal low-complexity algorithms reported in literature. It is shown that forward planning of packet transmissions offers significant performance improvements if the finite capacity of buffers is taken into account. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has the lowest order of computational complexity and permits simpler buffer organisation and access modes.},

abstract={Traditional computer networks were typically designed with system-wide optimization in mind. In noncooperative networks users make control decisions that optimize their individual performance objectives. Nash equilibria characterize the operating points of such networks. Nash equilibria exhibit, in general, suboptimal network performance. Focusing on routing, a methodology is devised for overcoming this deficiency, through the intervention of the network manager. The manager controls part of the network flow, is aware of the noncooperative behavior of the users and performs its routing aiming at improving the overall system performance. The existence of maximally efficient strategies for the manager, i.e., strategies that drive the system into the global network optimum, is investigated. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a maximally efficient strategy are derived. The maximally efficient strategy are shown to be unique and it is specified explicitly.},

abstract={A number of multicast tree algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Their approach to modeling the problem has some drawbacks in applications for ATM networks since only a single multipoint connection request is considered in the presence of link capacity constraints. In this paper, we present a detailed mathematical model for the generalized multicast arborescence (i.e., a roofed out-tree) problem in which there are a number of concurrent multipoint connections of various traffic types. Point-to-point connections are also considered as a special case of multipoint connections. A solution to the model determines, in the most economical way, an establishment of VPCs with reserved capacity and multicast arborescences using the established VPCs for multipoint connections. This model is a natural extension of the virtual channel assignment problem introduced by Kim (1995). Algorithms and numerical results are presented.},

abstract={We study the performance of a multiplexer using the generalized processor sharing (GPS) scheduling to serve Markov modulated fluid sources (MMFSs). We focus on a two-queue GPS system serving two classes of sources. By using a bounding approach combined with an approximation approach and by taking advantage of the specific structure of MMFSs, we are able to derive a lower bound and an upper bound approximation on queue length distributions for each class of the GPS system. Numerical investigations show that the lower bound and the upper bound approximation are very accurate. Hence our work greatly improves the earlier results on GPS scheduling which are obtained for a more general stochastic model. Application of our performance bounds to call admission control and bandwidth sharing is also illustrated, and a comparison with FIFO and strict priority in different scenarios is presented. We show that the flexibility provided by GPS does not provide much better performance than FIFO and priority when the classes only have loss requirements. However, this flexibility provides better performance when the classes exhibit delay requirements as well as loss requirements.},

abstract={A large class of teletraffic analysis problems encountered in communication networks are based on Markov chains of M/G/1 and G/M/1 type, the study of which require numerically efficient and reliable algorithms to solve the nonlinear matrix equations arising in such chains. The traditional transform approach to solve these chains which requires root finding is known to cause problems when some roots are close or identical. The alternative iterative schemes based on matrix analytic methods have in general low linear convergence rates yielding a computation time bottleneck in solving large-scale probability models. We develop a novel algebraic theory for the solution of these chains based on which we propose numerically efficient algorithms. The key to our approach is an invariant subspace computation implemented using the matrix sign function iterations. These algorithms have high convergence rates unlike the linear convergence rates of existing algorithms, they are amenable to parallelization and can easily be implemented using standard linear algebra software packages.},

By formulating the problem as one which is amenable to the generalized folding algorithm (GFA), we are, for the first time, able to analyze realistic systems with large buffer and complex input traffic. The dynamics of the system under realistic traffic environment and different operating regimes are studied. The effects of various modeling artifacts such as fluid-flow and infinite-buffer approximations are also investigated. The potential of statistical multiplexing in reducing bursty cell loss is demonstrated. The trade-offs between different system design alternatives, e.g., buffering vs. statistical multiplexing, are discussed. We also investigate the controlling effect of preemptive cell discarding on steady-state and transient system performance. Both single-level and two-level overload control with hysteresial-switching mechanisms are considered. The use of sojourn-time based QoS metrics to supplement long-term steady-state metrics is also discussed.},

abstract={For many applications, the end-to-end delay of an application-specific data unit is a more important performance measure than the end-to-end delays of individual packets within a network. From this observation, we propose the idea of group scheduling. Specifically, consecutive packet arrivals in a flow are partitioned into groups, and the same deadline (called group priority) is assigned to every packet in a group. We first present an end-to-end delay guarantee theorem for a network of guaranteed-deadline (GD) servers. The theorem can be instantiated to obtain end-to-end delay bounds for a variety of source control mechanisms and GD servers. We then specialize the delay guarantee theorem to group scheduling for a subclass of GD servers. We work out a detailed example to demonstrate how to use group scheduling in a particular class of networks. The advantages of group scheduling are discussed and illustrated with empirical results from simulation experiments.},

abstract={We introduce a specific transport and transmission scheme for video-on-demand called constant-rate transmission and transport (CRTT). CRTT establishes a CBR virtual channel between the video provider and the viewer's set-top box, and then transmits cells from the provider into this channel at a constant rate. Since we assume that the number of cells in a frame is variable, CRTT requires that some number of cells be built up in a set-top box buffer before the commencement of playback. The build up, cell transmission rate, and the set-top memory size must be chosen so that there is no starvation or overflow at the set-top box. We develop fundamental relationships between these parameters for viable CRTT. We then apply the theory to an MPEG encoding of Star Wars and find that the minimal set-top box memory for CRTT is 23 Mbytes. We also consider varying the constant rate over a small number of intervals. We find, for example, that for Star Wars approximately 2 Mbytes of set-top memory suffices with 32 constant-rate intervals.},

abstract={It is not an easy task in the UMTS environment to effectively design the transport and the management of traffic belonging to multimedia teleservices, due to the difficult communication requirements of such applications. It is proposed to contemporary use at the "transport" layer of the system several bearers, one for each traffic component of the multimedia service. Furthermore, a two-level (static and dynamic) priority mechanism is to be adopted by the higher protocol levels of the UMTS for the adaptation of call set-up, channel access, and admission control procedures to the nature of the multimedia services and to optimise the sharing of radio channel resources and the management of the reservation buffer. The results achieved demonstrate that the proposed mechanism shows a good performance especially during periods in which the system traffic load is high and reacts well to the worsening of the multimedia service quality, both in terms of information loss and synchronisation of its traffic components.},

abstract={We present a network service specifically designed for multimedia servers. It uses a histogram based traffic characterization and an overload control protocol to the eliminate packet losses in the network while providing heterogeneous statistical QoS. The key contribution of our protocol lies in combining open-loop and feedback-based control to: (1) provide heterogeneous QoS to clients in networking environments consisting of switches that may not have any scheduling support; and (2) migrate the functionality of discarding packets, in the event of congestion, to the sources which understand the semantics of the data. The protocol is efficient, makes very few assumptions about the underlying network, is realizable on current switching hardware (supporting FCFS scheduling), and is completely integrated with the architecture of a multimedia server.},

abstract={In a connection-oriented wireless LAN, the mobility of mobile hosts results in the establishment and disconnection of new and old virtual circuits. The resulting increase in signalling traffic along with the need to support multimedia stream handovers demand a fast, continuous and bandwidth-efficient handover protocol. We adopt a handover scheme based on partial re-establishments, where a new partial path converges to an existing path. Connection rerouting (CR) operations are then performed at the convergence/crossover switch (CX). To achieve localised handovers, a wireless cell clustering scheme is proposed. The clustering of base stations to cluster switches (CLSs) provides fast intra-cluster handovers since the CR operations are performed at the CLS. To support fast inter-cluster handovers, four CX discovery schemes (loose select, prior path, distributed hunt and backward tracking) are introduced. Simulation results obtained from a trace-driven mobile network simulator on four different network topologies (random, star, tree and hierarchical redundancy) reveal that both prior path and distributed hunt discoveries outperform the others by providing the fastest convergence with shorter resulting paths and higher circuit reuse efficiency.},

pages={1414-1424 vol.3},
abstract={This paper describes the design and implementation of a multi-cast transport protocol called RMTP. RMTP provides sequenced, lossless delivery of bulk data from one sender to a group of receivers. RMTP achieves reliability by using a packet-based selective repeat retransmission scheme, in which each acknowledgment (ACK) packet carries a sequence number and a bitmap. ACK handling is based on a multi-level hierarchical approach, in which the receivers are grouped into a hierarchy of local regions, with a designated receiver (DR) in each local region. Receivers in each local region periodically send ACKs to their corresponding DR, DRs send ACKs to the higher-level DRs, until the DRs in the highest level send ACKs to the sender, thereby avoiding the ACK-implosion problem. DRs cache received data and respond to retransmission requests of the receivers in their corresponding local regions, thereby decreasing end-to-end latency and improving resource usage. This paper also provides the measurements of RMTP's performance with receivers located at various sites in the Internet.},

pages={1425-1432 vol.3},
abstract={Reliable multicast suffers from the problem of feedback implosion. To achieve scalability, the number of receivers sending feedback in case of loss must remain small. However, losses experienced by different receivers are strongly correlated, since they share resources in the multicast tree. We present DTRM (deterministic timeouts for reliable multicast), a distributed algorithm to compute optimal deterministic timeouts for each receiver in a multicast tree as a function of the tree topology and sender-to-receiver delays. DTRM has several desirable properties. First, the computation of the timeouts is entirely distributed; receivers and intermediate nodes only rely on local topology information. Second, NACK implosion is provably avoided for a single loss anywhere in the tree if delay jitter is bounded. Third, feedback information does not need to be processed by intermediate nodes, and receivers do not have to collaborate. We foresee two possible uses for DTRM. In networks providing hard delay bounds, timeouts can be computed once at session set-up time. In networks with unbounded delays, such as the Internet, timeouts can be adaptively recomputed in response to changes in estimated round-trip times.},

volume={3},

pages={1433-1441 vol.3},
abstract={This paper presents a protocol and design for concurrent and reliable group multicast (many-to-many) from bursty data sources in general networks. In a group multicast, any node can be a multicast source and multiple nodes may start to multicast simultaneously, i.e., an asynchronous access to the network. The reliable multicast protocol presented in this work is window based with a combined sender and receiver initiation of the recovery protocol. In reliable multicasting the necessary requirement is to ensure that data is received correctly by all the active members of the multicast group. The approach taken in this work is to combine the multicast operation with the internal flow control, as a result, it is possible to provide: (1) loss-free multicast routing with a single and immediate acknowledgement message to the sender. Furthermore, in every multicast, (2) a node can access all the capacity allocated to its group with no delay, however, if several nodes are active in the same group then the capacity will be shared fairly. In addition, (3) each sender in the multicast group uses a single timer, and (4) a node can join and leave a multicast group in a transparent fashion, i.e., there is no need to explicitly notify the members of the group. A multiple criteria optimization study of the bandwidth allocation to each multicast group is presented. The optimization problem has two min-max objective functions: (1) for delay, which caused by the number of links needed to connect the group, and (2) for congestion, which is caused by sharing a link among multiple multicast groups. The bandwidth allocation among multicast group sharing the same link are further optimized using the max-min fairness criterion.},

volume={3},
number={},
pages={1442-1451 vol.3},
abstract={The specifications and performance of RAMP a reliable adaptive multicast protocol, are presented. Initially described in IETF RFC 1458 (1993), RAMP has been enhanced for use over an all-optical, circuit-switched, gigabit network under our ARPA-sponsored testbed for optical networking (TBONE) project. RAMP uses immediate, receiver-initiated, NAK-based, unicast error notification combined with originator based unicast retransmission. The approach is motivated by the loss characteristics of the TBONE network, where extremely low bit-error rates (10/sup -12/ or better) and the absence of any store-and-forward capabilities in the switches make packet losses almost entirely a result of receiver buffer overflows. As receiver losses are largely independent, use of unicast over multicast for NAKs and retransmission eliminates unnecessary receiver processing overhead associated with reading and discarding redundant packets. Use of immediate rather than delayed NAKs further improves performance by reducing both latency and the likelihood of buffer overflow. The effectiveness of this combined error control approach has been verified by other researchers, as well as through our own investigations. Interestingly, TBONE loss characteristics resemble those of switched virtual circuit ATM networks and packet-switched networks employing reservation services. As these networks provide quality of service guarantees in the switches, the likely source of packet loss is again due to receiver errors and buffer overflows. Hence, RAMP's design is also relevant for the next generation of packet switched networks.},

abstract={We consider the large buffer asymptotics of a multiplexer under two different self-similar traffic input models, viz., the infinite server model of Cox and the fractional Gaussian noise input model. In the former case the tail probabilities for the buffer content (in steady state) are shown to decay at most hyperbolically, while in the latter they are asymptotically Weibullian. Therefore, for given input rate and Hurst parameter, these dissimilar asymptotics result in vastly differing buffer engineering practices, thereby pointing to the inadequacy of the Hurst parameter as the sole parameter to characterize long-range dependence in traffic input models.},

These models fall into two classes depending on their construction. A study of these models provides a thorough understanding of how self-similarity arises in computer network traffic. We find that (i) all these models are (second-order) self-similar in nature; (ii) the Hurst parameter alone does not fully capture the burstiness of a typical self-similar process; (iii) the heavy-tailed property is not a necessary condition to yield self-similarity; and (iv) these models permit parsimonious modeling (using only 2-5 parameters) and fast simulation. Simulation verifies that these models exhibit a fractal behavior over a wide range of time scales.},

abstract={Variable bit rate (VBR) video traffic is expected to be one of the major applications that need to be supported by broadband packet-switched networks. A dynamic bandwidth allocation strategy used to support VBR video traffic is proposed. This strategy predicts the bandwidth requirements for future frames using either adaptive or non-adaptive least mean square (LMS) error linear predictors. The adaptive technique does not require any prior knowledge of the statistics, nor assumes stationarity. Several reservation schemes are also presented. Analysis using six one-half hour video traces indicate that prediction errors for the bandwidth required for the next frame are almost white noise. By reserving a bandwidth equal to the predicted value, only the prediction errors need to be buffered. Because the errors are almost white noise, a small buffer size, high utilization, and a small delay are achieved. Simulation results for 1-step linear predictor show that for the same expected cell loss, the buffer size is reduced by more than a factor of 100 and the network utilization is increased by more than 250% as compared to a fixed service rate.},

abstract={Future photonic LANs and MANs may be based upon single-hop architectures using wavelength division multiplexing and passive coupling. In such systems, stations access shared sets of channels using some combination of receiver or transmitter tunability. Due to the optical device limitations however, the number of available channels may not be as large as previously envisioned. As a result, spatial wavelength reuse may be required to achieve networks with an acceptable number of stations and performance. We present a single hop wavelength routed optical network architecture, referred to as the flat channel controller network (FCCN). The network is divided into a set of local optical clusters interconnected via a static wavelength router. Two architectural variations are examined. The first uses a distributed control scheme for signaling within each cluster and requires each station to have only a single fixed receiver and a single fast agile transmitter. The second uses a dedicated control channel within each cluster and requires each station to have an additional fixed receiver. Three packet switched media access protocols are examined, static TDMA, and two reservation protocols.},

We develop a method for analyzing the expected number of hops which can be applied to any torus topology with randomly assigned extra links when the simplest greedy routing is used. Using this method, we study the following topologies with extra links: one-dimensional unidirectional and bidirectional torus (i.e., ring), and two-dimensional bidirectional and unidirectional torus (e.g., bidirectional Manhattan network and Manhattan street network). We also show how these results can be extended to some non-torus topologies with extra links, such as the bus and the two-dimensional grid. From our analysis we find that the expected number of hops in a D-dimensional N-node torus with extra links grows as O(/sup D+1//spl radic/N) and that it can be reduced to O(/sup 2D//spl radic/N) with the orthogonal assignment of extra links.},

abstract={Resource contention in packet switched all-optical networks is being addressed in this paper through the combined use of fiber delay lines and 2/spl times/2 space photonic switches. With this basic approach, also known as Quadro or switched fiber delay lines (SDL), the solution efficiency is linked to its storage capacity, determined by the combined length of the fiber delay lines. In the past, this capacity was given by the number of 2/spl times/2 photonic switches used, i.e., the number of stages in the receiver, which limited the solution by cost, mainly determined by the switch component, and by the signal power loss and crosstalk introduced by each switch. This work presents and analyzes the use of "multibuffer" fiber delay lines, in Quadro, so termed since in it multiple packets are allowed to be concurrently stored (propagated) on each delay line. In this way the total storage capacity is increased, while the proposed design utilizing novel switch control is shown to significantly improve receiver and network performance, without increasing the number of the 6/spl times/2 space photonic switches in the system, i.e., its cost.},

Spectrum efficiency /spl nu//sub f/ (b/s/Hz) is investigated in a nonlinear amplified (NLA) environment-providing a 6 to 9 dB advantage in power efficiency. Our results show that the GSM compatible configuration of a specific cross correlated FQPSK-KF implementation offers up to 5.1 dB improvement in E/sub b//N/sub o/, power efficiency, and network capacity /spl nu//sub T/ (erlangs/Hz m/sup 2/) may be increased 76% over GMSK BT/sub b/=0.3.},

abstract={We address the problem of how a mobile node in a wireless network should vary its transmitter power so that energy consumption is minimized, subject to fixed quality-of-service constraints. Optimal solutions are obtained for channels with stationary, extraneous interference. A simple dynamic power management algorithm based on these solutions is developed. The algorithm is tested by a series of simulations, including the extraneous-interference case and the more general case where multiple, mutually interfering transmitters operate in a therefore highly responsive interference environment. Results show improved network capacity and stability in addition to substantially improved battery life at the mobile terminals.},

abstract={Linear microcells have been proposed for PCS systems employing low base station antennas. The layout of linear cells in such a system will depend on the characteristics of the propagation on line-of-sight (LOS) radio links, which have been measured by various groups. For planning purposes, it is common to use a power law dependence of the path loss on distance, together with slow fading statistics, both of which are obtained from the measurements by the regression analysis. The simplest regression analysis fits a single straight line to measurements of path loss (dB) plotted versus the logarithm of the antenna separation. However, it has been found that a two-segment regression fit gives a more accurate representation for the trend of the path loss variation, and as a consequence results in a smaller standard deviation for the slow fading statistics. In this paper, we show how the use of the two-segment regression leads to a more efficient system design employing less base stations to achieve the same quality of service (QOS).},

abstract={Network configuration information is useful in producing a visual map of the network complete in all details. The visual map is an essential component for network management and operations. It is also possible to generate an inventory report of a network. The inventory report describes the nodes, networks, interfaces, addresses, protocols, speeds, etc. and is a valuable component for network planning and administration. Unfortunately, network management is severely constrained in scope and effectiveness by the lack of any organized pool of network configuration information. We present results of our efforts to develop tools and techniques for automatically and mechanically synthesizing network configuration related information from the Internet. These techniques, we believe, will be instrumental in, generating the pool of network configuration information.},

pages={481-488 vol.2},
abstract={The SNMP and OSI network management standards define two different languages and information models for describing management information. The advocacy of these different approaches is often driven by politics, religion and history as much as by technical considerations. We hope to remain aloof from these partisan arguments and to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the models from the point of view of human managers and of implementors. Comparisons in the literature often focus on performance aspects; load on networks and managed systems, memory requirements, etc. The main focus of our paper is on the information models themselves. Our approach is to explore how the same management information would be modeled within the OSI and SNMP standards. We then assess the results from the point of view of the "naturalness" of the modeling, its extensibility and its likely impact on the efficiency of management interactions. In some networking environments-especially in telecommunications-the OSI and SNMP standards must co-exist. The Network Management Forum (NMF) has defined a series of guidelines concerning coexistence and these include a methodology for translating between information models. We also attempt to assess the effectiveness of the NMF translation rules.},

We propose a new semantic approach to network management. The semantics is defined by context-specific restrictions representing relationships between situations. By structuring the situation descriptions in a hierarchy, we build up a semantic framework for the network management which corresponds to the object-oriented development style and benefits from features like reusability, abstraction support, and accumulative developments.},

abstract={We use the theory of effective bandwidth for bandwidth allocation in high speed digital networks (ATM), and experiment with simulated Markov traces and actual VBR traces. To approximate the effective bandwidth, we use the four traffic descriptors: average rate, asymptotic variance, peak rate and average burst duration. In our experiments, we find the theory yields good approximations of the queue length distributions for simulated Markov traces and a video conference trace. However, our estimations for asymptotic variance do not converge for some VBR video traces. This implies that some VBR traces might be long-range dependent. Based for the fractional Brownian motion (FBM) model, we revise the theory of effective bandwidth and modify the associated traffic descriptors for such VBR traces. Our experiments show that the FBM model is good in heavy traffic, but does not fit well in light traffic.},

We apply these models to actual network traffic sources as measured on a medical network and evaluate the impact of changing bottlenecks in network transfers. Our data and results emphasize the sensitivity of any traffic model to the underlying machine capabilities and the timescale of interest.

We attempt to unify several approaches ranging from histogram/interval based methods to "frequency domain" approaches by further investigating the asymptotic behavior of a multiplexer carrying a large number of streams. This analysis reveals the salient traffic/performance relationships which should guide us in selecting successful methods for traffic management and network dimensioning.},

The analysis focuses on "small" to "moderate" buffer sizes under the conditions of strictly stable multiple time scale arrivals. For a class of examples we analytically determine the radius of convergence using methods of linear operator theory. We also give general sufficient conditions under which the radius converges to zero; this shows roughly what situations have to be avoided for the proposed method to work well. We combine the asymptotic expansion method with the EB approximation, and give an approximation procedure for the buffer probabilities for all buffer ranges. The procedure is tested on extensive numerical examples. We suggest this procedure for efficient admission control in ATM networks.},

This paper describes an integrated implementation model for AAL1 carrying CBR MPEG2 traffic with particular focus on the receiver convergence sublayer functions and the issues affecting the end-to-end performance of the AAL1 connection. Through a comprehensive simulation of the AAL and the ATM layers, we verify that the implementation model is capable of delivering the desired QoS for video applications under a wide range of cell losses and cell delay variations. In addition, we show the effects of using FEC with byte interleaving on the end-to-end performance parameters. We conclude that cell loss statistics constitute the key factors in determining the overall performance of the AAL1 connection.},

abstract={One of the most important traffic types in future packet-switched networks is high-bandwidth, variable-bit-rate (VBR) video. Since video is a delay-sensitive media, the network must allocate resources to maintain quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees on throughput, delay, and delay jitter to video connections. A key component of resource allocation is the traffic characterization of video sources that determines the resources required to support video connections. In this study, we propose a method for characterizing VBR video traffic with a fixed number of leaky buckets in networks with a deterministic service. We explore tradeoffs of network utilization in two directions: (1) the number of leaky buckets used for traffic characterisation, and (2) the amount of information from a video sequence used to produce the characterization. We evaluate our method with a set of 30-minute long MPEG-compressed video traces.},

The arrival processes we analyze are the Markov modulated Poisson processes (MMPP) and the Markov modulated fluid (MMF) processes which are important in modeling various traffic types, such as voice, video, and still images. Our hybrid analytical technique combines results from large buffer theories and quasi-stationary approaches to analyze the loss probability of a finite buffer queue. Our technique is shown to be valid even for heterogeneous sources. We also show that capacity allocation based on the popular effective bandwidth scheme can lead to considerable underutilization of the network, and that allocating bandwidth based on our model can improve the utilization significantly. We provide numerical results for different types of traffic and validate our model via simulations.},

The goal is to "fill in" the residual bandwidth, without exceeding a specified queue threshold. In order to obtain this, we propose a simple and classical proportional controller, plus a Smith predictor to overcome instabilities due to large propagation delays, as well as to avoid cell loss. We propose an effective EPRCA implementation in which each source computes its input rate based on the maximum VC queue length along the path. Theoretical and experimental results show that high throughput is achieved even with queue sizes independent of the round trip delay.},

abstract={We consider a model comprising of a single bottleneck node/switch fed by multiple Markov modulated fluid sources and with significant and possibly different propagation delays. The amount of traffic released by the sources depends on its state as well as delayed feedback from the network. Such a source model allows us to capture ABR as well as VBR traffic types. We obtain analytical results for computing various performance measures associated with this model. Based on these analytical results, we study the performance of the feedback policy for two different delay classes. In the parameter regime investigated, we observe that while the sources with a smaller delay do better, they do not do significantly better. Moreover, the performance of the farther sources improves as the second set of sources is moved closer. Thus, what may be perceived as unfairness due to the difference in feedback delays should really be interpreted as the closer sources helping the farther sources while helping themselves.},

abstract={Graphs are commonly used to model the structure of internetworks, for the study of problems ranging from routing to resource reservation. A variety of graph models are found in the literature, including regular topologies such as rings or stars, "well-known" topologies such as the original ARPAnet, and randomly generated topologies. Less common is any discussion of how closely these models correlate with real network topologies. We consider the problem of efficiently generating graph models that accurately reflect the topological properties of real internetworks. We compare the properties of graphs generated using various methods with those of real internets. We also propose efficient methods for generating topologies with particular properties, including a transit-stub model that correlates well with the internet structure. Improved models for the internetwork structure have the potential to impact the significance of simulation studies of internetworking solutions, providing a basis for the validity of the conclusions.},

abstract={The transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) suite is widely used to interconnect computing facilities in modern network environments. However, there exist several security vulnerabilities in the TCP specification and additional weaknesses in a number of its implementations. These vulnerabilities may enable an intruder to "attack" TCP-based systems, allowing him/her to "hijack" a TCP connection or cause denial of service to legitimate users. We analyze TCP code via a "reverse engineering" technique called "slicing" to identify several of these vulnerabilities, especially those that are related to the TCP state-transition diagram. We discuss many of the flaws present in the TCP implementation of many widely used operating systems, such as SUNOS 4.1.3, SVR4, and ULTRIX 4.3. We describe the corresponding TCP attack "signatures" (including the well-known 1994 Christmas Day Mitnick Attack) and provide recommendations to improve the security state of a TCP-based system, e.g., incorporation of a "timer escape route" from every TCP state.},

The variates of the ARMA filter are, however, non-Gaussian. A sequence of steps leading through (i) parameter estimation, (ii) generating the distribution of the variates, (iii) forecasting tail percentiles, and (iv) synthetic generation of non-negative integer sequences is presented. The data indicates that parameter estimates drift slowly with time and may need to be re-computed periodically for accurate forecasts. The forecasting algorithm, has potential application in dynamic resource allocation. The synthetic traffic generation algorithm may be used in simulation studies of resource management algorithms.},

year={1996},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={621-629 vol.2},
abstract={Many applications such as video and audio can tolerate loss. When the network layer provides a best-effort service such as on the Internet, the loss rate of the underlying network service may be higher than an application's tolerance for loss. This paper analytically studies retransmission-based partially reliable transport (layer protocol) service. Results show that a partially reliable transport service provides increasingly higher throughput and lower delay than a reliable transport service as an application's loss tolerance increases and as the underlying network service gets more lossy. Also, to some degree, a partially reliable transport service eases the negative effects of ack losses on throughput. Three cost functions associated with the reliability level that a system can support are introduced. These cost functions help demonstrate the penalty when a transport service does not support the ideal reliability level for an application. Results show that the use of a reliable transport service when an application only needs a partially reliable transport service can cause considerable throughput drops and delay increases in lossy networks. On the other hand, at high loss rates, an unreliable transport service is unable to respect an application's loss tolerance. Thus, in lossy environments, a partially reliable transport service is necessary to avoid the extra cost of a reliable transport service, and, at the same time, to guarantee the minimal reliability that an application requires.},

abstract={We propose a work-conserving scheduling mechanism for providing deterministic performance guarantees in ATM networks. The most attractive feature of the proposed mechanism, which we call carry-over round robin (CORR), is its simplicity. It is an extension of weighted round robin scheduling. We have derived closed form bounds for worst case end-to-end delay when CORR is used in conjunction with the composite leaky bucket, and moving window regulators. Our results show that albeit its simplicity, CORR is very competitive with some of the more complex scheduling disciplines such as packet-by-packet generalised processor sharing and stop-and-go queueing.},

abstract={In emerging communication networks (B-ISDN based on asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology), a single link may carry traffic for thousands of connections with different traffic parameters and quality-of-service requirements. High-speed links, coupled with small packet/cell sizes, require efficient switch architectures that can handle cell arrivals and departures every few microseconds, or faster. This paper presents a collection of self-clocked fair queueing (SCFQ) architectures amenable to efficient hardware implementation in network switches. Exact and approximate implementations of SCFQ efficiently handle a moderate range of connection bandwidth parameters, while hierarchical arbitration schemes scale to a large range of throughput requirements. Simulation experiments demonstrate that these architectures divide link bandwidth fairly on a small time scale, preserving connection bandwidth and burstiness properties.},

The scheme employs the leaky bucket model as the input traffic description model and regulates the input traffic at user network interface (UNI) to comply with the input traffic specification. Inside the network ATM switches provide bounded local delays to individual cells using a traffic controller and a non-preemptive rate-monotonic priority scheduler.},

pages={679-687 vol.2},
abstract={Buffer management schemes are needed to fairly regulate the sharing of memory among different output port queues in a shared memory ATM switch. Of the conventional schemes, static threshold is simple but does not adapt to changing traffic conditions while pushout is efficient and adaptive but difficult to implement. We propose a novel scheme called dynamic threshold which combines the simplicity of static threshold and the adaptability of pushout. The key idea is that the maximum permissible length, for any individual queue at any instant of time, is proportional to the unused buffering in the switch. A queue whose length equals or exceeds the current threshold value may accept no more new cells. The dynamic threshold procedure presented improves the fairness and switch efficiency by guaranteeing access to the buffer space for all output queues. Computer simulation is used to compare the loss performance of the dynamic threshold technique with that of static threshold and pushout. The dynamic threshold scheme is shown to be a good compromise: while nearly as simple as static threshold control, it offers most of the performance benefits of pushout. Like pushout, the dynamic threshold method is adaptive, so it is more robust to uncertainties and changes in traffic conditions than, static threshold control.},

abstract={The design of the queue manager is of key importance for the shared buffer ATM switch architectures. We propose the recycling queue manager (RQM) with reduced hardware complexity by eliminating the external FIFO for the avail queue. By separating the shared buffer into cell and address memories, the power consumption of idle accesses in the RQM can be reduced, and the linked list bubbles can be removed. The required storage for the proposed RQM and other queue managers of existing shared buffer ATM switches are compared, considering delay/loss priorities and partial sharing. It is found that the RQM requires the least storage size for most cases, and the reduction is more significant as the switch dimension grows. A two-level RQM-based scheme, with reduced storage, is also proposed for the shared multi-buffer switch architecture. An RQM prototype chip supporting a 16/spl times/16 switch with two priority classes and back pressure capability was implemented and successfully tested to verify the proposed architecture.},

The comparison is analytically performed over a common system with a common analytical model. Despite the many analyses that have appeared on S-ALOHA, the one we develop is new because a throughput density uniformly distributed on the plane is considered in a multiple cell environment. The analysis clearly shows the effect of intra-cell and inter-cell interference on the ALOHA system and proves that a superior throughput is achieved by CDPA, which completely avoids intra-cell interference. Our analysis also provides an insight into the effectiveness of power control on both systems.},

abstract={In a wireless packet (e.g., ATM) network that supports an integrated mix of multimedia traffic, a large variety of mobiles with different service rates will need to be accommodated efficiently in a bandwidth-on-demand fair-sharing manner. We propose and study multi-code CDMA (MC-CDMA) with distributed-queueing request update multiple access (DQRUMA) for multi-rate wireless packet networks. The network incorporates MC-CDMA (a flexible multiplexing scheme for providing multi-rate packet transmissions) and DQRUMA (an efficient demand-assignment multiple access protocol for wireless access and scheduling) to form a unified bandwidth-on-demand fair-sharing platform for multi-rate wireless services. A slot-by-slot packet transmit scheduling policy provides the possibility of slot-by-slot allocation of pseudo-noise (PN) codes (primary codes) and optimal power levels to the mobiles involved in packet transmissions. Also, a maximum capacity power allocation (MCPA) criterion is derived to exploit the subcode concatenation property of the MC-CDMA transmission. Simulation results show that the system provides close to ideal-access performance for multi-rate mobiles, both with homogeneous traffic characteristics and with a mix of heterogeneous traffic characteristics.},

abstract={We present a comparative analysis of bandwidth access control schemes under nonstationary traffic conditions for heterogeneous circuit-mode traffic offered to a B-ISDN network link. A unified model for analysing the behavior of several bandwidth access control schemes is developed using a Markov process model with acceptance functions. Numerical techniques are used to solve the associated Chapman-Kolmogorov equations and determine the nonstationary behavior. Performance results are given for several common bandwidth access control schemes, namely: complete sharing, complete partitioning, partial sharing, classical trunk reservation, and the probabilistic reservation policy. It is shown that the use of the average arrival rate to estimate the average connection blocking rate may be an underestimate for a system with a time varying arrival process. Also, it is found that a nonstationarity in one traffic class arrival process can impact other stationary traffic classes and the degree of variability depends on the particular access control scheme.},

year={1996},

abstract={Consider the link bandwidth allocation for transport of correlated traffic through a queueing system under a maximum allowable delay constraint d/sub max/. We decomposed the traffic into three frequency regions: low-frequency traffic in 0<|/spl omega/|/spl les//spl omega//sub L/, high-frequency traffic in |/spl omega/|/spl ges//spl omega//sub H/ and mid-frequency traffic in /spl omega//sub L/<|/spl omega/|</spl omega//sub H/. The zero-frequency component (DC term) of the traffic provides the average input rate which corresponds to the minimum link bandwidth requirement. Subject to delay constraint d/sub max/, we identify /spl omega//sub /spl lambda//=0.01/spl pi//d/sub max/ and /spl omega//sub H/=2/spl pi//d/sub max/. Hence, the transport of low-frequency traffic exceeds the limit of d/sub max/-constrained buffer capacity; its link bandwidth is essentially captured by its peak rate. In contrast, for the transport of high-frequency traffic the d/sub max/-constrained buffering is most effective and no additional link bandwidth is required. Essentially, the solution of /spl omega//sub L/ and /spl omega//sub H/ plays a role as "sampling theory" in traffic measurement for buffer capacity design and link bandwidth allocation. Equivalently in the time domain, the timescale of the low-frequency traffic is longer than or equal to 200d/sub max/; the timescale of high-frequency traffic is shorter than or equal to d/sub max/. Since the link bandwidth allocation of low- and high-frequency traffic requires no measurement of second-order statistics, the timescale of interest for traffic measurement must be identified in [d/sub max/, 200d/sub max/].},

Although closed-form expressions for the end-to-end performance measures (probabilities of voice and video blocking, normalized voice processing loads, probabilities of video rate dropping and data queueing) are available, they cannot be applied directly because of the prohibitive computation required. As a result, fast and accurate approximation schemes based on the reduced load method are developed. The bandwidth allocated to a video call is varied; together with the step size of the virtual paths, the performance of the network can be controlled and optimized. Extensive numerical results are given to validate the approximation schemes developed.},

abstract={The FRP (fast reservation protocol) utilizes a unique feature of ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) technology. The FRP is supposed mainly to be applied to LAN interconnection. We provide an exact analysis for a class of the FRP to obtain the burst (a protocol data unit of FRP) level performance of the FRP. One of the main features of the ATM is that the transmission rate can be adjusted according to the network congestion states. In our modeling, this feature is incorporated in such a way that the bandwidth a source requests is reduced if an attempt to reserve the bandwidth is rejected by the network. A rationale behind this is that rejection of the bandwidth request indicates network congestion. Therefore, the request with the smaller bandwidth after the reservation failure enables better sharing of network resources, which results in a performance improvement. To solve our model, which contains a very huge number of system states, we introduce a new numerical approach which is an extension of Sumita and Rieders's (1991) replacement process approach. Through numerical examples, the appropriate transmission rate control method is examined, and considerations on backoff time and overhead of RM cells are also presented.},

abstract={We present and evaluate new techniques for call admission control (in ATM networks) based on neural networks. The methods are applicable to very general models that allow heterogeneous traffic sources and finite buffers. A feedforward neural network (NN) is used to predict whether or not accepting a requested new call would result in a feasible aggregate scream, i.e., one that satisfies the QOS requirements. The NN input vector is a traffic descriptor for the aggregate stream that has the following beneficial properties: its dimension is independent of the number of traffic classes; and it is additive, allowing it to be updated efficiently by simply adding the traffic descriptor of the new call. A novel asymmetric error function for the NN helps achieve our asymmetric objective in which rejecting an infeasible stream is more important than accepting a feasible one. We present a NN design that provides an optimal linear compression of the NN inputs to a smaller number of traffic parameters. The special case of one compressed parameter corresponds to an NN version of the equivalent bandwidth. Experiments show our methods to be better than methods based on the equivalent bandwidth, with respect to call blocking probability and the percentage of feasible streams that an correctly classified.},

abstract={This paper proposes a neural fuzzy connection admission control (NFCAC) scheme, which combines benefits of fuzzy logic controller and learning abilities of the neural-net, to solve the connection admission control (CAC) problems in ATM networks. Fuzzy logic systems have been successfully applied to deal with the traffic control related problems and provided a robust mathematical framework for dealing with "real-world" imprecision; multilayer neural networks are capable of producing complex decisions with arbitrarily nonlinear boundaries and they have been used as a solution for CAC. However, the application of a neural network or a fuzzy logic system to CAC presents some difficulties in a real system operation. The proposed NFCAC solves the difficulties by combining the benefits of the existing traffic control mechanisms, linguistic control strategy of the fuzzy logic controller and the learning ability of the neural net. Simulation results show that the proposed NFCAC saves a large amount of training time and simplifies the design procedure of a CAC controller but provides a superior system utilization, while keeping the QoS contract, than either the neural network or fuzzy logic system does.},

abstract={We consider the combined control problem of connection admission, flow rate, and bandwidth allocation (capacity, service-rate) under nonstationary conditions. A fluid flow model in state variable form describes the time varying mean behaviour of available bit rate (ABR) traffic, which competes with guaranteed traffic for network resources. Using nonlinear control we derive an integrated control strategy, for the finite buffer and finite server case, that is insensitive to any propagation delay. We also derive bounds on mix between ABR and guaranteed traffic to ensure that control strategy is effective, and select control design variables which can be used to influence the delivered QoS. The performance of proposed scheme is evaluated using analysis and simulation. Simulation results show that it achieves effective server and buffer utilisation (as predicted by analysis) and by appropriate choice of control design variables achieves prescribed bounded delays (for guaranteed traffic only) and zero cell loss (even for ABR traffic demands exceeding server capacity, which if not controlled would cause losses). Hence proposed scheme delivers guaranteed QoS to user and avoids retransmissions, thus increasing network utilisation.},

abstract={QoS networks are more and more envisioned to provide preemptable communications. That is, a new call may cause on-going ones to be interrupted depending on the current network utilization. For instance, preemption combined with layered video encoding allows graceful degradation of the received stream to be performed as more and more users compete for resources. We propose a general admission policy that solves the preemption-based resource allocation problem. This policy allows users to compete for call setup and keeping, via a smart market approach. Algorithmic and accounting issues are investigated, inside a single node, in an end-to-end approach and for multicast calls. Our approach must be appreciated as a building block for a higher-level administration policy, in which it provides controlled user competition.},

pages={802-809 vol.2},
abstract={This paper analyzes the performance of output channel grouped asymmetric packet switch modules in ATM networks, under geometrically bursty input traffic with input/output traffic imbalance. The switch module considered has n inputs and m outputs. A packet destined for a particular output address (out of g) needs to access only one of the r available physical output ports; m=gr. The motivation for the study of these switch modules is that they are the key building blocks in many large multistage switch architectures. A combination of exact derivation and numerical analysis yields the saturation throughput of input buffered switch modules for a wide range of traffic nonuniformity factors and burstiness. Results show a degradation in the maximum throughput, under input/output imbalance, as the average burst length increases. An interesting observation is that asymmetric switches tend to diminish the throughput advantage of the output-buffered switch module over the input buffered switch module under any traffic nonuniformity and burstiness. Our results also indicate that increasing the number of output ports per output address can significantly improve the switch performance, especially when traffic is highly nonuniform and bursty.},

Space-time tradeoffs are evaluated using an analytical model based on Markov process. The probability that a new connection can be established without crosstalk is calculated by taking into consideration the traffic correlations between stages. The model is applicable to both Banyan and dilated Banyan networks under either switch or stage control. Our results imply that space-time tradeoffs are improved by using Banyans instead of dilated Banyans.

abstract={We study a shared-memory center-stage switch with input multiplexers and output demultiplexers, where backpressure is applied from the demultiplexers to the center stage, and from the center stage to the multiplexers. We consider three backpressure schemes: (i) non-selective backpressure (NSB), where a congested center stage or a congested demultiplexer applies backpressure indiscriminately to all the traffic destined to it, regardless of the destination; (ii) per-port selective backpressure (PPSB), where the center stage applies backpressure selectively only to the traffic destined to the center-stage port(s) experiencing congestion, but a demultiplexer applies backpressure indiscriminately to all the traffic destined to it; and (iii) per-subport selective backpressure (PSSB), where both center-stage switch and demultiplexers apply backpressure selectively only to the traffic destined to the output link(s) experiencing congestion. We show that NSB introduces heavy HOL blocking which limits the throughput of the system and causes heavy losses. On the contrary, PPSB and PSSB achieve high throughputs, and allow one to increase buffer utilization in the system while keeping the majority of the buffers physically separate in the input multiplexers. Both these schemes perform very well in the case where only limited sharing of the buffers in the center stage is allowed, as required to guarantee fairness in the switch. With PSSB, small buffer sizes in the demultiplexers can be used. If the buffers in the demultiplexers are large, PPSB and PSSB offer comparable performance.},

To support existing, future and unknown applications, the signaling system has to be very flexible and efficient. We define the signaling problem, present several possible signaling system structures, compare the advantages and disadvantages of these systems, and then we propose a new signaling system structure. The fundamental idea of the new signaling system is the logical separation of the signaling system structure from the underlying communication network, even though they may be built on the some physical network. The proposed signaling system structure shows very promising performance in terms of signaling latency and scalability.},

pages={855-862 vol.2},
abstract={SSCOP is a new data link control protocol designed for ATM networks. To achieve high throughput, SSCOP uses the selective repeat retransmission policy, enforced using the exchange of POLL and STAT control frames between the sender and the receiver. To avoid unnecessary retransmission of information frames (I-frames), SSCOP uses the "checkpoint concept" where every POLL has a sequence number and every outstanding I-frame is associated in the sender buffers with the sequence number of the POLL sent before the last transmission of that I-frame. Using these sequence numbers, the sender knows to ignore unnecessary retransmission requests. The paper proposes an improved scheme for avoiding unnecessary retransmission of I-frames. The new scheme significantly reduces the memory needed for storing control information of the protocol at the sender interface. Compared with the SSCOP, the only potential drawback of the proposed scheme is that under certain circumstances the retransmission of lost I-frames may be delayed. However, the paper analyzes the sequence of events that must take place in such a case, and concludes that the probability for such a sequence is negligible and that the new protocol performs as well as the SSCOP.},

The paper elaborates on the issues involved, presents specific algorithms and a TMN-compliant management architecture. The proposed management service influences the routing decisions by conveying network-wide information and contributes to the network load balancing by directing the routing algorithms to route traffic to the least congested network areas.

We also look at the effects several different reservation models and user behavior can have on network stability. Our work is unique from previous network resource reservation investigations in that we consider the effects of reservations for multipoint-to-multipoint applications.

abstract={In this paper, we discuss the role of prices in combining user characterization, network resource allocation, and contract negotiation to form a complete connection establishment process. We suggest that such a process should encourage network efficiency through distributed resource allocation among virtual circuits, circuit bundles, and virtual paths. We adopt effective bandwidth as our user traffic characterization and our pricing base, and we measure network efficiency by total user benefit. We allow a limited degree of statistical multiplexing by incorporating multiplexing gain into the prices. Finally, we propose a hierarchical and distributed negotiation structure under which only hierarchically adjacent and geographically local network entities communicate with each other.},

abstract={The design philosophy and implementation of the BALANCE system is described. BALANCE is a flexible, network independent and computer architecture independent load balancing system which is designed to support a wide range of software, including parallel and distributed applications as well as schedulers. The generic server and server system call structures are used as bases to enhance flexibility and to build complex services. BALANCE is not tied to a particular scheduling algorithm, rather the users are allowed to build their own schedulers. To demonstrate the flexibility and power of BALANCE, a set of system services and scheduling algorithms has been implemented and evaluated. A new delay scheduling algorithm which postpones the execution of jobs in high load situation is proposed. It is shown that this algorithm effectively improves system throughput and yet bounds the response times for the console commands.},

abstract={A revolution is occurring in the scope and range of information, communication and education services that will be made available to schools, libraries, town-halls, clinics and, most importantly, residences. These services will be provided initially, primarily over hybrid fiber-cable systems, either by telephone companies or cable companies. The old cable plant is being upgraded and used in totally new ways. The topology and physical characteristics of the upstream channel present new challenges for efficient channel access. We present a media access protocol that efficiently transfers data on this channel. A primary goal in the design was to keep the portion of the protocol resident in the station as simple as possible. Thus we use centralized control located in the cable head-end and minimize intelligence in the station. We refer to this protocol as centralized priority reservation or CPR. A station wishing to transmit sends a request to the head-end using a contention channel. The head-end acknowledges the request and then schedules the request, informing the station by means of a grant message when to transmit. The protocol performs well under heavy load. Performance is affected little by the number of stations, the speed of the system and the physical length of the system.},

abstract={Looking toward the future of computer networking, we see that the need for increased interconnectivity will require continual growth in speed and features. Today there are several successful LANs competing in the 100 Mbps arena. Now we are considering the next generation of network. Ideally, users need a solution that provides the necessary bandwidth and connectivity while preserving their investments in hardware and software. This paper will present an architecturally different design for a new more effective LAN. The new architecture will provide a convenient solution to the need for higher total network capacity by interconnecting multiple FDDI networks (and/or network segments). The underlying network architecture is based on the FDDI protocols, which is an attractive feature for those who have invested resources in FDDI. Scalability is a required feature for any future network design and is addressed in detail by this architecture. This alternative next-generation networking solution has been presented to the ANSI standards committee X3T12 as a possible FDDI follow-on standard (FFOL).},

year={1996},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={920-927 vol.2},
abstract={This paper is concerned with deadline guarantees of synchronous messages with deadlines equal to periods, in a timed token ring network such as FDDI where the timed token medium access control (MAC) protocol is used. The timed token protocol guarantees a bounded access time and an average bandwidth for synchronous traffic. However, this guarantee alone, though necessary, is insufficient for guaranteeing the transmission of synchronous messages before their deadlines. To ensure timely delivery, the synchronous bandwidth must be carefully allocated to individual nodes. We propose and analyse an efficient and practical local synchronous bandwidth allocation (SBA) scheme. The new scheme performs better than any previously published as it calculates the synchronous bandwidth such that during the message period, the total synchronous transmission time definitely available (when judged only by local information) is exactly equal to the transmission time required. Our scheme also differs significantly from previously reported ones by explicitly taking into account the synchronous bandwidth allocation for message sets whose minimum message deadlines (D/sub min/) are less than twice the target token rotation time (TTRT), and consequently can apply to any synchronous message set (with D/sub min/>TTRT). The feasibility of the allocations produced by the proposed scheme and the worst case achievable utilisation of the scheme are also discussed.},

year={1996},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={928-936 vol.2},
abstract={Max-min fairness has been recognized as an optimal throughput-fairness definition. However, its realization in packet switching networks and its computational requirements have not yet been understood. We attempt to take a step in this direction, in the context of local area network (LAN) traffic. The max-min definition is given in terms of transmission rates of sources sending to their destinations (sessions). In order to realize max-min rates in a packet switching environment, transmission schedules of packets need to be realized. We first show that finding max-min fair schedules (with given rates) requires global state and timing information of all the nodes in the network. We then design a local scheduling algorithm for ring and bus networks with minimum transmission-delay, concurrent access, and spatial bandwidth reuse. This distributed algorithm uses only partial state information and is based on locally exchanging simple signals only between directly conflicting sessions (sessions which share at least one link) rather than collecting global information. The results of this algorithm are novel in various ways: (1) we prove that each session has an access-delay of at most twice its bottleneck link; (2) we show that the algorithm operates adaptively with an optimal access-delay in a dynamic environment (bursty traffic sources); and (3) by means of simulation experiments we further show that this algorithm achieves, in a steady-state, max-min fair rates for a vast majority of sessions and an average aggregate throughput which is 99 percent the throughput obtained by max-min fair rates.},

year={1996},

number={},
pages={553-560 vol.2},
abstract={In a fair multicast video distribution scheme each receiver should receive a video stream with a quality that is commensurate with its capabilities or the capabilities of the path leading to it, regardless of other receivers or network paths. This fairness problem results from the fact that multicast communication trades economy of bandwidth with granularity of control. Distributing video using individual feedback-controlled point-to-point streams results in high bandwidth utilization but the granularity of control is high as communication parameters can be negotiated individually with each receiver. In contrast, using a single multicast stream has good bandwidth economy, but very low granularity of control. In this paper we propose, implement and experiment with a system that spans the spectrum represented by the two extremes above. In the scheme, called destination set grouping (DSG), a source maintains a small number of video streams, carrying the same video but each targeted at receivers with different capabilities. Each stream is feedback-controlled within prescribed limits by its group of receivers. Receivers may move among streams as their capabilities or the capabilities of the network paths leading to them change. The scheme is shown to improve fairness significantly at a small bandwidth cost.},

abstract={Future video-on-demand (VOD) servers will need to support many existing and emerging video data types. These data types include 15-fps (frames per second) animation, 30-fps NTSC (National Television Systems Committee) quality video and 80-fps HDTV (High Definition Television) video. The different display speeds and frame sizes of these various video types impose a major constraint on the design of VOD storage systems. This paper presents the results of an experimental study, conducted on a Silicon Graphics Inc. Onyx computer system, that investigated the impact of these video types on the design of a VOD storage system. The key issues involved in supporting these different video types in a VOD environment are: (1) the video allocation method, and (2) the proper block size (a block is a basic unit of several contiguous video frames that will be accessed from several disks each time a request is made) to use for data striping and retrieval. Two allocation schemes, logical volume striping and application level striping, along with varying frame and block sizes for each of the three different video data types are examined. The focus of our study is to determine the maximum number of concurrent accesses that can be supported with a guaranteed quality of service. The degree of scalability (i.e., striping data over more disk arrays) of the experimental VOD system used is also studied.},

abstract={Video on demand (VOD) systems are becoming popular. They have special requirements for receiving VOD data steadily, but common general communication protocols cannot meet their requirements. Several new protocols have been designed to fulfil this service requirement, but it takes a long time for a protocol to be supported from end to end. We propose a VOD communication system that is implemented as an user-level library on top of a common existing protocol. This protocol is easy to port, and the level of connectivity is almost the same as in the underlying existing protocol. We describe the important points related to its implementation, such as the low overhead of implementation and the flow control mechanism. We implemented a prototype system, measured its performance, and concluded that implementing a communication system as a user-level library enables us to implement a VOD portable communication system with a practical level of performance.},

abstract={Most video-on-demand (VOD) systems use a single, powerful server to deliver video streams to users. We consider a novel server array approach for delivering video services on networks. Such an approach has the benefits of (l) greater system capacity, as individual server has individual disk and network channel, (2) scalability, as more clients can be supported by adding more servers without data duplication, and (3) fault tolerance, as server-level fault-tolerant and fault-recovery schemes can be devised. We describe our experiences and results in the implementation of a server-array-based VOD system. Our system now has four P5-90 servers serving 40 PC-486 stations using a 10 Mbps Ethernet switch. The system can deliver 40 simultaneous and independent 1.2 Mbps, 30 fps, full TV size, MPEG-1 video streams. Our results demonstrate that with careful protocol design, Ethernet can deliver continuous video and audio services.},

pages={35-42 vol.1},
abstract={In cellular networks, blocking occurs when a base station has no free channel to allocate to a mobile user. One distinguishes between two kinds of blocking, the first is called new call blocking and refers to blocking of new calls, the second is called handoff blocking and refers to blocking of ongoing calls due to the mobility of the users. We first provide explicit analytic expressions for the two kinds of blocking probabilities in two asymptotic regimes, i.e., for very slow mobile users and for very fast mobile users, and show the fundamental differences between these blocking probabilities. Next, an approximation is introduced in order to capture the system behavior for moderate mobility. The approximation is based on the idea of isolating a set of cells and having a simplifying assumption regarding the handoff traffic into this set of cells, while keeping the exact behavior of the traffic between cells in the set. It is shown that a group of 3 cells is enough to capture the difference between the blocking probabilities of handoff call attempts and new call attempts.},

abstract={Two important quality-of-service (QoS) measures for current cellular networks are the fractions of new and handoff "calls" that are blocked due to unavailability of "channels" (radio and/or computing resources). Based on these QoS measures, we derive optimal admission control policies for three problems: minimizing a linear objective function of the new and handoff call blocking probabilities (MINOBJ), minimizing the new call blocking probability with a hard constraint on the handoff call blocking probability (MINBLOCK) and minimizing the number of channels with hard constraints on both of the blocking probabilities (MINC). We show that the well-known guard channel policy is optimal for the MLNOBJ problem, while a new fractional guard channel policy is optimal for the MINBLOCK and MINC problems. The guard channel policy reserves a set of channels for handoff calls while the fractional guard channel policy effectively reserves a non-integral number of guard channels for handoff calls by rejecting new calls with a probability that depends on the current channel occupancy. It is also shown that the fractional policy results in significant savings (20-50%) in the new call blocking probability for the MINBLOCK problem and provides some, though small, gains over the integral guard channel policy for the MINC problem. Further, we also develop computationally inexpensive algorithms for the determination of the parameters for the optimal policies.},

year={1996},

pages={51-58 vol.1},
abstract={Future cellular systems are expected to use multilayered, multisized cells to cover non-homogeneous populated areas. An example in literature is given by a 2 level hierarchical architecture in which an overlaying macrocell provides a group of overflow channels utilized when a microcell, which covers a densely populated area, is not able to accommodate a new call, or a handover from another microcell. The macrocell has the higher hierarchical position, meaning that it can receive handover requests from microcells, lower in the hierarchy, as well as from other macrocells. On the contrary, a call served by the macrocell cannot handover to a microcell. This paper proposes a reversible hierarchical scheme characterized by the presence of handover attempts from macrocells to microcells. The scheme is conceived so that the microcells are given the majority of the traffic load as they are able to operate with very high capacity, while the macrocells, having lower channel utilization, can better carry out their support task. An analytical study is carried out showing that the system performance can be improved, at the expense of relatively little increase of network control overhead, when compared with the classical, i.e. nonreversible hierarchical scheme.},

abstract={This paper deals with multicasting in an internetwork with mobile hosts, particularly with regard to mobile-IP and distance vector multicast routing (DVMRP) protocols. When the source of a multicast datagram is a mobile host (MH), the datagram may not reach all group members to which the datagram is addressed, including other mobile hosts. When the source is a static host and the multicast group includes mobile hosts, a mobile group member may receive datagrams in one cell but not in another. Further when a MH enters a cell which contains no other member of the same group, the MH will experience a delay before it starts receiving datagrams addressed to that group. Mobility between campuses which result in a MH acquiring an additional unicast address, also has an effect on multicast routing. We propose enhancements to DVMRP executed at the mobility support routers (MSR) that ensure correct forwarding of multicast datagrams to and from mobile hosts. Our solutions do not require any change at hosts and routers unaware of mobility, i.e. the modifications are limited to MSRs and MHs. We also describe an implementation incorporating a subset of our proposals.

abstract={Multicast routing protocol proposals such as PIM and CBT have been based on the notion of group-shared trees. Since the construction of a minimal-cost tree spanning all members of a group is difficult, they rely on center-based trees, and distribute packets from all sources over a single shortest-path tree rooted at some center. While PIM and CBT provisionally use administrative selection of centers or trivial heuristics for locating the center of a group, they do not preclude the use of other methods as long as they provide an ordered list of centers. Other previously proposed heuristics typically require knowledge of the complete network topology, a requirement which is not always practical for a distributed problem such as Internet routing. In this paper we investigate the problem of finding a good center in distributed fashion, study various heuristics for automating center selection, and examine their applicability to real-world networks. We also propose several new algorithms which we feel to be more practical than existing methods. We present simulation results showing that of the methods potentially feasible in the Internet multicast backbone, ours offer the best results in terms of cost and delay.},

abstract={Many multicast applications, including audio and video, require quality of service (QoS) guarantees from the network. Hence, multicast admission control and resource reservation procedures will be needed. In this paper we present a general framework for admission control and resource reservation for multicast sessions. Within this framework, efficient and practical algorithms that aim to efficiently utilize network resources are developed. The problem of admission control is decomposed into several subproblems that include: the division of end-to-end QoS requirements into local QoS requirements, the mapping of local QoS requirements into resource requirements, and the reclaiming of the resources allocated in excess. These are solved independently of each other yielding a set of mechanisms and policies that can be used to provide admission control and resource reservation for multicast connection establishment. The resource allocation algorithms we consider specifically accommodate receiver heterogeneity (in both end-to-end and per-hop QoS requirements) by reserving necessary and sufficient resources for a multicast session. An application of these algorithms in the context of packetized voice multicast connections over the Mbone is provided to illustrate their applicability.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of providing per-connection end-to-end delay guarantees in a high-speed network. We assume that the network is connection oriented and enforces some admission control which ensures that the source traffic conforms to specified traffic characteristics. We concentrate on the class of rate-controlled service (RCS) disciplines, in which traffic from each connection is reshaped at every hop, and develop end-to-end delay bounds for the general case where different reshapers are used at each hop. In addition, we establish that these bounds can also be achieved when the shapers at each hop have the same "minimal" envelope. The main disadvantage of this class of service disciplines is that the end-to-end delay guarantees are obtained as the sum of the worst case delays at each node, but we show that this problem can be alleviated through "proper" reshaping of the traffic. We illustrate the impact of this reshaping by demonstrating its use in designing RCS disciplines that outperform generalized processor sharing-based service disciplines.},

abstract={In this paper, we develop a general model, called latency-rate servers (LR-servers), for the analysis of traffic scheduling algorithms in broadband packet networks. The behavior of an LR scheduler is determined by two parameters-the latency and the allocated rate. We show that several well-known scheduling algorithms, such as weighted fair queueing, virtualclock, self-clocked fair queueing, weighted round robin, and deficit round robin, belong to the class of LR-servers. We derive tight upper bounds on the end-to-end delay, internal burstiness, and buffer requirements of individual sessions in an arbitrary network of LR-servers in terms of the latencies of the individual schedulers in the network, when the session traffic is shaped by a leaky bucket. Thus, the theory of LR-servers enables computation of tight upper-bounds on end-to-end delay and buffer requirements in a network of servers in which the servers on a path may not all use the same scheduling algorithm. We also define a self-contained approach to evaluate the fairness of LR-servers and use it to compare the fairness of many well-known scheduling algorithms.},

year={1996},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={120-128 vol.1},
abstract={The generalized processor sharing (GPS) discipline is proven to have two desirable properties: (a) it can provide an end-to-end bounded-delay service to a session whose traffic is constrained by a leaky bucket; (b) it can ensure fair allocation of bandwidth among all back logged sessions regardless of whether or not their traffic is constrained. The former property is the basis for supporting guaranteed service traffic while the later property is important for supporting best-effort service traffic. Since GPS uses an idealized fluid model which cannot be realized in the real world, various packet approximation algorithms of the GPS have been proposed. Among these, weighted fair queueing (WFQ) also known as packet generalized processor sharing (PGPS) has been considered to be the best one in terms of accuracy. In particular, it has been proven that the delay bound provided by WFQ is within one packet transmission time of that provided by GPS. We show that, contrary to popular belief there could be large discrepancies between the services provided by the packet WFQ system and the fluid GPS system. We argue that such a discrepancy will adversely effect many congestion control algorithms that rely on services similar to those provided by GPS. A new packet approximation algorithm of GPS called worst-case fair weighted fair queueing (WF/sup 2/Q) is proposed. The service provided by WF/sup 2/Q is almost identical to that of GPS, differing no more than one maximum size packet.},

abstract={We investigate the performance of CBR traffic in the context of large-scale networks, where many connections and switches coexist and interact. We develop a framework for simulating such networks, decoupling the influence of breadth and depth. Our results are briefly as follows: we found that a Poisson stream is a good approximation to a superposition of many CBR streams with differing phases and bandwidths. Delays incurred by a reference stream with cross traffic composed of many CBR streams with different bandwidths and phases do not exceed a few cell times even under heavy load, which means that buildout buffers of 10 to 20 cells seem to be sufficient after traversing 20 switches. CBR traffic can be efficiently served by the first come first served (FCFS) scheduling discipline, which has the least implementation cost. Surprisingly, the round robin (RR) and weighted round robin (WRR) disciplines perform worse than the FCFS, despite their greater implementation complexity. We also compare an analytical approximation method based on the multiclass parametric decomposition method, with the simulation results and found it to be suitable for estimating the end-to-end delays for the FCFS discipline.},

Distributed control protocols are provided for setting up and taking down lightpaths reliably and for updating the topology of the network, including the lightpaths. These protocols allow lightpath originators to obtain resources with high probability by minimizing reservation conflicts, allow lightpaths to stay up even if controllers along the path in the network fail, ensure that controllers in the network have a consistent view of the state of each lightpath, and ensure that all resources taken up by a lightpath are released once the lightpath is taken down.},

We first propose an improved framework for the analysis of networks with arbitrary topology. We introduce a simple model for networks with a variable number of converters and analyze the effect of wavelength converter density on blocking probability. We then apply this framework to two sparse network topologies, the ring and the mesh-torus, and obtain the blocking performance. The results show that, in most cases, only a fraction of the network nodes need to be equipped with wavelength conversion capability for good performance. Finally, the tradeoff between physical connectivity, wavelength conversion, and the number of available wavelengths is studied through networks with random topologies.},

year={1996},

pages={164-171 vol.1},
abstract={We consider the problem of routing and assignment of wavelength (RAW) in optical networks. Given a set of requests for all-optical connections (or lightpaths), the problem is to (a) find routes from the source nodes to their respective destination nodes, and (b) assign wavelengths to these routes. Since the number of wavelengths is limited, lightpaths cannot be established between every pair of access nodes. In this paper we first consider the dynamic RAW problem where lightpath requests arrive randomly with exponentially distributed call holding times. Then, the static RAW problem is considered which assumes that all the lightpaths that are to be set-up in the network are known initially. Several heuristic algorithms have already been proposed for establishing a maximum number of lightpaths out of a given set of requests. However most of these algorithms are based an the traditional model of circuit-switched networks where routing and wavelength assignment steps are decoupled. In this paper a new graph-theoretic formulation of the RAW problem, dubbed as layered-graph, has been proposed which provides an efficient tool for solving dynamic as well as static RAW problems. The layered-graph model also provides a framework for obtaining exact optimal solution for the number of requested lightpaths as well as far the throughput that a given network can support. A dynamic and two static RAW schemes are proposed which are based on the layered-graph model. Layered-graph-based RAW schemes are shown to perform better than the existing ones.},

The proposed routing scheme is intended for bidirectional networks-with four incoming and four outgoing links per switch. In terms of average performance measures, our method performs no worse than the best local routing schemes, when the offered load is light or moderate. Unlike other deflection schemes proposed for MSN, our method is inherently asynchronous. This simplifies the switch design and eliminates some problems with the original synchronous approach, like the need to account for slight discrepancies in transmission rates of different switches.},

abstract={A CAC algorithm must efficiently determine if a new connection can be admitted by verifying that its QoS requirements can be met without violating those of previously admitted connections. In hard real-time systems, the QoS requirements are specified in terms of end-to-end cell deadlines and no cell loss due to buffer overflow. A CAC algorithm must account for interdependencies among connections caused by statistical multiplexing of cells in ATM networks. Arbitrarity of network topology may lead to cyclic dependencies among various connections. We present an efficient CAC algorithm that addresses the above issues. The algorithm uses a traffic descriptor called the maximum traffic rate function to effectively compute bounds on end-to-end delays of connections and buffer requirements within the network. Our work differs from most previous work in that it does not require traffic restoration inside the network.},

abstract={We consider real-time traffic in a heterogeneous internetworking environment with IP routers, MAC bridges, hubs, switched LANs etc. We assume that the current routing protocols remain unchanged. However in this environment, in order to provide quality of service (QoS): bandwidth, delay, constant-bounded jitter and no-loss due to congestion, we suggest a new flow control function called time-driven priority, which is an internal traffic shaping mechanism. We show how it supports two classes of connections: constant bit rate (CBR) with deterministic guarantees, and variable bit rate (VBR) with statistical multiplexing. The mechanism does not require to identify and separate the packet flows of different real-time sessions/connections inside the network. As a result, it achieves lower switching complexity when compared with other internal traffic shaping methods. As consequences of the time-driven priority mechanism we further achieve: (1) QoS parameters which are independent of the connection bandwidth, (2) QoS parameters which are independent of the existing heterogeneous internetworking asynchronous data traffic and (3) the capability for policing and securing the network QoS.},

abstract={In this paper we study the problem of scheduling real-time traffic in high-speed ATM networks. Scheduling can be performed at different points in the ATM network, such as, at the multiplexers and switches. In our model the arriving traffic cells are assumed to have weights associated with them which determine their importance measure (for example, cells belonging to one traffic class may have different weights than cells belonging to another traffic class). Further, a cell is said to have been lost if its deadline Is violated. We develop a simple procedure, S-OPT, to minimize the cell loss rate for single-class traffic. Using this procedure we develop an optimal algorithm, M-OPT, that minimizes the weighted loss rate at a network node. Finally, we provide a heuristic algorithm, M-HEUR, which significantly reduces the complexity of M-OPT and closely approximates its performance. In each case the scheduling decisions are based only on the current information in the queue. Using numerical results we show that our scheduling algorithms significantly outperform well known algorithms such as first-in-first-out (FIFO) and static priority (SP).},

Our work is novel in that it is the first end-to-end ATM transport service to provide reliable, flow controlled data transfer. We describe the mechanisms and the operating system support needed to provide these services. A detailed performance measurement allows us to determine the bottlenecks in our system and do tune our implementation. With this tuning, we are able to achieve a user-to-user throughput of 55 Mbps between two 66 MHz Intel 80486 personal computers with Fore Systems' HPA-200 EISA-bus host adaptors. The user-to-user latency for small messages is around 720 /spl mu/s. These figures compare favorably with the performance from far more expensive workstations and validate the correctness of our design choices.},

abstract={Techniques for avoiding the high memory overheads found on many modern shared-memory multiprocessors are of increasing importance in the development of high-performance multiprocessor protocol implementations. One such technique is processor-cache affinity scheduling, which can significantly lower packet latency and substantially increase protocol processing throughput. In this paper, we evaluate several aspects of the effectiveness of affinity-based scheduling in multiprocessor network protocol processing, under packet-level and connection-level parallelization approaches. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of the scheduling technique (1) when a large number of streams are concurrently supported, (2) when processing includes copying of uncached packet data, (3) as applied to send-side protocol processing, and (4) in the presence of stream burstiness and source locality, two well-known properties of network traffic. We find that affinity-based scheduling performs well under these conditions, emphasizing its robustness and general effectiveness in multiprocessor network processing. In addition, we explore a technique which improves the caching behavior and available packet-level concurrency under connection-level parallelism, and find performance improves dramatically.},

abstract={Many important protocols, such as Q.2931 or any protocol based on the ASN.1 basic encoding rules, are transmitted using tagged message formats, in which a message can be considered as a sequence of interleaved tag and data fields, where tag fields define the meaning of subsequent fields. These messages are computationally expensive to decode, partly because decoding each data field requires resting one or more tag fields. Evidence suggests that in some applications, although the potential space of message encodings may be very large, only a small number of message layouts are seen frequently, and thus some of the work required in decoding can be amortized over many messages. This paper analyzes the use of run-time code generation to generate optimized decoding instruction sequences for received messages matching previously observed layouts, and describes a prototype system that applies the techniques to decoding the Q.2931 and ASN.1 BER protocols. In the average case, substantial performance gains are seen.},

abstract={The Internet provides a single class best effort service. From an application's point of view, this service amounts in practice to providing channels with time-varying characteristics such as delay and loss distributions. One way to support real time applications such as interactive audio given this service is to use control mechanisms that adapt the audio coding and decoding processes based on the characteristics of the channels, the goal being to maximize the quality of the audio delivered to the destinations. In this paper, we describe and analyze a set of such control mechanisms. They include a jitter control mechanism and a combined error and rate control mechanism. These mechanisms have been implemented and evaluated over the Internet and the MBone. Experiments indicate that they make it possible to establish and maintain reasonable quality audioconferences even across fairly congested connections.},

abstract={Queue inferencing algorithms are used to derive estimates of queue lengths and/or customer waiting times from a priori information about the customer arrival process and the observed sequence of times at which each customer enters and leaves service. In this paper, we extend these techniques by decoupling the arrival time constraints from the customer departure times, which allows us to handle additional features like server vacations. We then show how these techniques can be used to monitor a single station in a polling system, or in a shared medium local area network such as Ethernet, token ring and FDDI. Using these results, passive, non-intrusive network monitoring tools could be developed to estimate waiting times and queue lengths for any host on the network by observing only the packet departure times from the nodes.},

pages={248-254 vol.1},
abstract={This paper introduces a method for obtaining the steady state probabilities in G/sup [X]//D/C/K type queues. The solution method is more efficient than other known techniques in terms of both time and space requirements. The method is an extension of the MBH technique used to solve single server queues, It is shown that this method allows one to perform a parametric study quickly and efficiently by building on already existing results. The solution technique is used to evaluate the performance of concentrators used in ATM networks where low speed lines are connected to higher speed ones, e.g., 150 Mb/s lines to a 620 Mb/s or 1.2 Gb/s line. The concentrator is equipped with a finite capacity buffer, and is modeled as a synchronous multiple server queue with finite buffer. The concentrator is fed by a discrete batch Markov arrival process (D-BMAP) which is capable of capturing the traffic characteristics of a broad range of applications. The paper derives the probability of cell loss introduced by the concentrator buffering, and considers the effect of the buffer size as well as the line speeds on this measure.},

abstract={Evaluation of the behavior of queues with nonstationary arrival processes is of importance in several applications including communication networks. However, the analysis of nonstationary queues is in general computationally complex and seldom produces closed form expressions. Thus approximation methods may be more appropriate. The pointwise stationary fluid flow approximation (PSFFA) for determining the mean queue length of nonstationary queues is presented. The PSFFA combines steady state queueing results with a simple fluid flow model to develop a single nonlinear differential equation model of the queue. Numerical integration techniques are used to solve the PSFFA model and the method is illustrated by several examples. The power of this approach is that it can handle very general queueing systems.},

abstract={We consider the P/sub i/-persistent protocol and we derive approximate analytical results for the unfinished work distribution at each node on the bus under the assumption that the arrival process at each node follows a discrete time Gaussian process. A deterministic version of the protocol, which reduces the variance of the service process and therefore improves queueing performance, is also considered. The solution is simple and fast to compute and is not overly sensitive to the number of nodes. Simulation results indicate that the results are accurate so long as the performance can be accurately approximated based on the dominant effect of an exponential tail in the distribution of queued load. The results are also applicable to a single server Gaussian queue with priorities.},

pages={271-278 vol.1},
abstract={We consider policies for scheduling cells in an input-queued multicast (ATM) switch. It is assumed that each input maintains a single queue for arriving multicast cells and that only the cell at the head of line (HOL) can be observed and scheduled at one time. The policies are assumed to be work-conserving, which means that cells may be copied to the outputs that they request over several cell times. When a scheduling policy decides which cells to schedule, contention may require that it leave a residue of cells to be scheduled in the next cell time. The selection of where to place the residue uniquely defines the scheduling policy. We prove that for a 2/spl times/N switch, a policy that always concentrates the residue, subject to a natural fairness constraint, always outperforms all other policies. Simulation results indicate that this policy also performs well for more general M/spl times/N switches. We present a heuristic round-robin policy called mRRM that is simple to implement in hardware, fair and performs almost as well as the concentrating policy.},

abstract={A new parallel algorithm for route assignment in Benes-Clos network is studied. In packet switching systems, switch fabrics must be able to provide internally conflict-free paths simultaneously and to accommodate packets requesting for connections in real-time as they arrive at the inputs. Most known sequential route assignment algorithms, such as the looping algorithm for Benes (1962) networks or Clos (1953) networks, are designed for circuit switching systems where the switching configuration can be rearranged at a relatively low speed. Most existing parallel routing algorithms are not practical for packet switching because they either assume the set of connection requests is a full permutation or fail to deal with output contentions among the set of input packets. We develop a parallel routing algorithm by solving a set of Boolean equations which are derived from the connection requests and the symmetric structure of the Benes network. Our approach can handle both the partial permutations and the output contention problem easily. The time complexity of our algorithm is O(log/sup 2/N), where N is the network size. Furthermore, we extend the algorithm and show that it can be applied to the Clos network if the number of central modules is a power of two.},

abstract={This paper analyzes two popular heuristics for ensuring packet integrity in ATM switching systems. In particular, we analyze the behavior of packet tail discarding, in order to understand how the packet level link efficiency is dependent on the rates of individual virtual circuits and the degree of the imposed overload. In addition, we study early packet discard and show that the queue capacity needed to achieve high efficiency under worst-case conditions grows with the number of virtual circuits and we determine the efficiency obtainable with more limited queue capacities. Using the insights from these analyses, extensions to early packet discard are proposed which achieve high efficiency with dramatically smaller queue capacities (independent of the number of virtual circuits).},

abstract={It is well known that head-of-line (HOL) blocking limits the throughput of an input-queued switch with FIFO queues. Under certain conditions, the throughput can be shown to be limited to approximately 58%. It is also known that if non-FIFO queueing policies are used, the throughput can be increased. However it has not been previously shown that if a suitable queueing policy and scheduling algorithm are used then it is possible to achieve 100% throughput for all independent arrival processes. In this paper we prove this to be the case using a simple linear programming argument and quadratic Lyapunov function. In particular we assume that each input maintains a separate FIFO queue for each output and that the switch is scheduled using a maximum weight bipartite matching algorithm.},

abstract={A common approach used for decreasing end-to-end connection setup delay in ATM networks is to provision partial segments a priori using virtual path connections (VPCs). In this paper, we present an analysis to study the effect of such provisioning. The analysis demonstrates that significant savings in bandwidth, and hence network costs, are achieved if the number of provisioned VPCs are minimized, especially if there is uncertainty in the traffic pattern characterization. For a given example, we show that to achieve a 0.1% blocking probability requirement, if link capacities are shared (i.e., not partitioned a priori to provisioned VPCs), resource savings of 14.4%, 47.9% or 80% are possible under exact, approximate and poor traffic characterizations, respectively. If the above bandwidth savings are to be achieved in networks that use traditional node-by-node connection setup approaches, end-to-end connection setup delay will increase. In this paper, we propose a new connection setup algorithm that allows the savings in bandwidth obtained through sharing while at the same time controlling the connection setup delay.},

abstract={Real-time communication with performance guarantees is expected to become an important feature of future computer networks. Given an ATM network topology, its virtual path (VP) layout, and its traffic demands, we consider in this paper the problem of selecting for each virtual circuit (VC) with timing requirements a route (i.e., a sequence of VPs) along which sufficient resources are available to meet the user-specified end-to-end delay requirements. Our objective is to (i) provide the timing guarantee for the VC, while not jeopardizing the QoS guarantees to other existing VCs. We adopt the real-time channel model to characterize the traffic characteristics and the timing requirements of a VC. We then propose a distributed VC routing scheme based on the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm to identify an "appropriate" route through the network. By "appropriate", we mean that the route traverses a minimum number of VPs among all possible routes that have sufficient resources over to fulfill the end-to-end timing requirement of the VC. To ensure that there are sufficient bandwidths over all the VPs along the selected route, we incorporate in our proposed scheme a priority assignment method to calculate the minimum worst-case traversal time which messages of a VC will experience on a VP along which the VC is routed. We also comment on the performance of, and the message overhead incurred in the proposed scheme.},

abstract={We propose a new policy for virtual path bandwidth allocation in broadband networks. Based on a threshold scheme, our policy handles the inherent tradeoff between bandwidth utilization and processing costs. In each virtual path controller the thresholds are chosen so as to keep bandwidth utilization high, while obtaining a low rate of processing requests. Two novel ideas are used in our threshold scheme: adaptivity, which results in a better prediction of future bandwidth requirements; and hysteresis, which prevents excessive processing of requests due to oscillations around thresholds. We tested the performance of our new bandwidth control scheme, and compared it with previously suggested schemes. The performance measures were the expected amount of unused bandwidth, the average signaling load and the blocking probability. Performance has been evaluated through numerical computations as well as by simulations. Our analysis is based on a time segmentation technique which allows us to reduce a Markov chain with NM states into M Markov chains with N states and a one-dimensional chain with M states. Our results show that our policy significantly improves upon previously suggested approaches.},

abstract={We formulate the problem of multicast tree generation in asymmetric networks as one of computing a directed Steiner tree of minimal cost. We present a new polynomial-time algorithm that provides for trade-off selection, using a single parameter /spl kappa/, between the tree-cost (Steiner cost) and the runtime efficiency. Using theoretical analysis, we (1) show that it is highly unlikely that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm with a performance guarantee of constant times optimum cost, (2) introduce metrics for measuring the asymmetry of graphs, and (3) show that the worst-case cost of the tree produced by our algorithm is bounded in proportion to the graph asymmetry for two of the metrics. For a class of graphs whose asymmetry is upper bounded by a constant, this gives constant times optimum performance guarantee and is significant in light of (1). We also show that three well-known algorithms for (undirected) Steiner trees are but particular cases of our algorithm. Our experimental study shows that operating at a low /spl kappa/ gives nearly best possible average tree cost while maintaining acceptable runtime efficiency.},

pages={345-352 vol.1},
abstract={A local lightwave network can be constructed by employing two-way fibers to connect nodes in a passive-star physical topology, and the available optical bandwidth may be effectively accessed by the nodal transmitters and receivers at electronic rates using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). The number of channels, w, in a WDM network is limited by technology and is usually less than the number of nodes, N, in the network. Channel sharing, achievable via time-division-multiplexing, may be used to construct practical multi-hop networks under this limitation. Multicasting-the ability to transmit information from a single source node to multiple destination nodes-is becoming an important requirement in high-performance networks. Multicasting, if improperly implemented, can be bandwidth-abusive. Channel sharing is one approach towards efficient management of multicast traffic. We develop a general modeling procedure for the analysis of both unicast (point-to-point) and multicast (point-to-multipoint) traffic in shared-channel, multi-hop WDM networks. The analysis is comprehensive in that it considers all components of delay that packets in the network experience-namely, synchronization, queueing, transmission, and propagation. The results show that, in the presence of multicast traffic, WDM networks with w<N channels may actually perform better than if w=N channels are used.},

abstract={We study the problem of constructing multicast trees to meet the quality of service requirements of real-time, interactive applications operating in high-speed packet-switched environments. In particular, we assume that multicast communication depends on (a) bounded delay along the paths from the source do each destination, and (b) bounded variation among the delays along these paths. We first establish that the problem of determining such a constrained tree is NP-complete. We then derive heuristics that demonstrate good average case behavior in terms of the maximum inter-destination delay variation of the final tree. We also show how to dynamically reorganize the initial tree in response to changes in the destination set, in a way that is minimally disruptive to the multicast session.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose and evaluate ARIES, a heuristic for updating multicast trees dynamically in large point-to-point networks. The algorithm is based on monitoring the accumulated damage to the multicast tree within local regions of the tree as nodes are added and deleted, and triggering a rearrangement when the number of changes within a connected subtree crosses a set threshold. We derive an analytical upper-bound on the competitiveness of the algorithm. We also present simulation results to compare the average-case performance of the algorithm with two other known algorithms for the dynamic multicast problem, GREEDY and EBA (edge-bounded algorithm). Our results show that ARIES provides the best balance among competitiveness, computational effort, and changes in the multicast tree after each update.},

title={Source policing for ATM systems based on peakedness rate},
year={1996},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={369-376 vol.1},
abstract={We consider a new policing device suitable for ATM applications. The device operates on an arbitrary source which is fed to a single server queue with a deterministic server. The policing function is implemented at the cell level by assuming the source traffic passes through an infinite server queue whose performance allows a tight control of the policed parameters. An interesting element is that this policing function is not only capable of simultaneously enforcing source parameters like mean rate and burst length, but it also serves to control some desired performance of the single server queue like maximum and mean occupancies.},

year={1996},

number={},
pages={377-383 vol.1},
abstract={We present a definition of burstiness for delay sensitive traffic streams in terms of a function, i.e., the cell loss probability of a bufferless multiplexer at all non-negative link capacities. Some properties of the definition are proved. One property implies any definition of burstiness in terms of a real number may not be appropriate. The other property implies the commonly used moment matching method in approximating traffic sources may not be appropriate either. We also present a quantization algorithm for networks which provide only finitely many bit rates for describing traffic characteristics. Our proposed quantization algorithm guarantees the quantized version is always burstier than the original source and thus can be used to design call admission control scheme for an ATM network.},

title={Real-time estimation of UPC parameters for arbitrary traffic sources in ATM networks},
year={1996},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={384-392 vol.1},
abstract={In networks based on the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), traffic sources are subjected to a usage parameter control (UPC) function which controls the emitted cell stream by either discarding or delaying cells according to the parameters of a deterministic algorithm (e.g. the dual leaky bucket). The UPC parameters constitute a traffic descriptor which are used to allocate network resources to the traffic source. This paper presents a scheme for determining dual leaky bucket UPC parameter values for an arbitrary traffic source from observations of its emitted cell stream. The selection of UPC parameters is based on a novel statistical characterization of the observed cell stream, the user's tolerance for traffic shaping and a cost function based on the network resource allocation policy. Our scheme makes weak modeling assumptions and is robust for a wide class of traffic streams.},

year={1996},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={393-400 vol.1},
abstract={Through comprehensive simulation studies, we have evaluated the ATM layer end-to-end performance of a constant bit rate (CBR) MPEG2 connection. For most practical cases that we have considered, a cell delay variation (CDV) value of 160 /spl mu/sec is obtained (using 155 Mbps OC-3 rate), well below the 1 msec worst case stated in prior studies. The results also indicate that the uniform distribution proposed in the ATM Forum provides a pessimistic model for the cell delay variation. We demonstrate that a gamma distribution adequately models the cell delay and delay variation (CDV). We also study the effect of various network/source parameters (such as the background load, the number of background sources, the number of hops, and the link-speed) on the variances of CDV and the end-to-end delay of the reference connection. Finally, we examine the variation in the cell delay correlation of a reference connection with the above parameters. We show that the correlation is a decreasing non-periodic/periodic function if the reference CBR is multiplexed with the same/other classes of CBR connections.},
