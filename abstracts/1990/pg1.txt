pages={8-14 vol.1},
abstract={An experimental ring communication network, the Cambridge Backbone Ring, for integrated computer data, voice, and real-time video applications is described. The network is aimed as a backbone facility for interconnecting groups of Cambridge Fast Ring (CFR) networks in the Cambridge area. Media access control is through the empty slot technique, with transmitting stations filling multiple slots each ring revolution. The network operates on monomode optical fiber and is designed for an eventual line rate of 1000 Mb/s. In the backbone ring architecture, the bandwidth of the fiber-optic channel can be partitioned into a number (currently four) of time division multiplexing (TDM) channels. This enables stations of varying cost and bandwidth to be attached to one network, parameterized by the number of channels a station can use concurrently. The backbone ring architecture achieves full connectivity, even with the simplest type of station. Some brief traffic simulation results are presented.<<ETX>>},

pages={15-22 vol.1},
abstract={A solution to the token ring problem of lowered efficiency during light and moderate loads is proposed. It is shown how the medium access can be managed in a distributed way, using two tokens. The overhead is kept to a minimum. It is shown that the performance of this protocol is superior to that of the single-token ring protocol under light to medium loads, while it is slightly worse at higher loads. The protocol is then extended to a greater number of tokens. It is shown that increasing the number of tokens improves the performance at light load, but degrades the performance at high load.<<ETX>>},

pages={23-29 vol.1},
abstract={Results of a performance analysis are presented for several token ring protocols in a backbone environment; the fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) and the exhaustive service and the single-service broad site wideband networks for a reduced speed of 100 Mb/s. The operation of the protocols is studied in detail with respect to several performance parameters like percentage of token use or number of packets transmitted per token capture. For performance comparison, queue length as well as packet and file delay is considered. Every media access protocol under consideration is shown to work very well for typical numbers of stations (<25) in the asynchronous mixed traffic environment. At heavy load the FDDI protocol performs better than the single-service strategy due to the reduced token rotation overhead.<<ETX>>},

pages={30-38 vol.1},
abstract={An expanded implementation of a rate control throttle where an arriving job queues in a finite buffer where the token bank is empty is examined. It is shown that the throughput and blocking of jobs depends on the capacity of the job buffer and the capacity of the token bank only via the sum of the two capacities, and not on their individual values. The job buffer is not needed to enhance the robustness of the throughput of the throttle to changes in the exogeneous job arrival rate; however, a job buffer, along with a token bank and with adjustable buffer capacities, does have the potential to shape the departure process and to adapt between a delay control and a work rejection control.<<ETX>>},

One approach to this difficult problem-exploiting the beneficial cost-performance tradeoffs afforded by the new generation of personal computers (PCs) while building on the existing base of a deployed system-is studied. The functional areas constituting network management are examined and used to define an architectural structure and hardware base. The architecture defines a seamless interexchange of data between the host computer and the PC. This exchange must be realizable both in the dual-box (host and PC) configurations and for applications that reside in the same box as the host. Server/requester models are examined as building blocks in implementing the seamless design. Further issues on control, capability passing, and security are examined.<<ETX>>},

year={1990},
volume={},

pages={95-104 vol.1},
abstract={An error-control-based approach, called diversity coding, that provides nearly instantaneous self-healing digital communication networks is presented. This is achieved by constructing an error-correcting code across logically independent channels and by treating link failures within the framework of an erasure channel model. Diversity coding is more efficient than previous approaches to self-healing communication networks since it is nearly instantaneous, is transparent to the end user, minimizes the required extra capacity, and does not need rerouting, resynchronization, or a feedback channel. It is applicable to both circuit-switched and packet-switched networks and to a wide variety of network topologies. Diversity coding can be extended to provide protection from short-duration environmental disruptions, such as multipath fading in radio networks and polarization dispersion in fiber-optic networks, or, in conjunction with previous error detection schemes, to provide forward error correction for random and burst errors.<<ETX>>},

The functions of the adaptation layer for data end points are discussed. A critical function of the data adaptation layer is to prevent corruption of information carried in 802.6 cells.

Introducing the distributor between the stages of shift networks allows of packets to be distributed evenly to all the input ports of shift networks in the following stage.

abstract={The fairness problems suffered by distributed-queue-dual-bus (DQDB) networks that span metropolitan areas are examined in detail. The problems arise because the network control information is subject to propagation delays that are much longer than the transmission time of a data segment. A rate control procedure is proposed that requires only a minor modification of the current DQDB protocol. In order to guarantee that a node acquires only 90% of the available slots, every time it inserts nine data segments into its local queue it inserts one extra request slot into its transmission queue. This lets an extra idle slot go by that was not requested by any downstream node.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Distributed-queue multiple-access (DQMA) and cyclic-reservation multiple-access (CRMA) access schemes for gigabit-per-second local and metropolitan area networks are described. These schemes are based on a slotted unidirectional bus structure, with both folded and dual-bus configurations. Like the distributed-queue dual-bus (DQDB) scheme, both the DQMA and the CRMA access schemes achieve full throughput independent of network speed and distance. They have two significant advantages over DQDB. They provide throughput fairness even at high speeds and large distances, where DQDB exhibits dramatic unfairness, and, by allowing reservation of multiple consecutive slots, they make segment labeling unnecessary and facilitate packet reassembly significantly.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Traffic processing algorithms are discussed for the slotted interconnected-grid network (SIGnet). SIGnet is intended for use as a high-performance backbone in metropolitan and extended-metropolitan areas. The system is designed to exploit the use of existing wavelength division multiplexing and coherent lightwave technologies. When accommodating nonisochronous traffic classes, the virtual topology in SIGnet is piecewise regular. As a result, bandwidth allocation and network evolution are easily accomplished. The philosophy of the design is to drastically minimize the buffering and protocol requirements at the transmit nodes, thus giving a highly cost-effective implementation. The SIGnet architecture is introduced, and results are given for certain traffic processing algorithms which have been investigated. A two-stage analytic model is presented which allows for the calculation of both detailed link traffic flow rates and the mean queueing delay at individual nodes. The results indicate that in typical subnetworks, reasonable accuracy may be obtained over a wide range of parameter values using link independence assumptions.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An analytical model of the telecommunications network is formulated, representing the entire network as a single entity. The resulting model contains a realistic (i.e. not overly simplified) view of the network, and hence can be used to develop the optimal evolution strategy for the Bell Operating Companies (BOC's) network. The process of developing the optimal evolution strategy is referred to as the strategic planning process. Background associated with the strategic planning process of a telecommunications network is given. Attempts are made to illustrate some basic underlying assumptions in the telephony. The problem to be solved and nomenclature are defined. Models for the fundamental elements of the network, i.e. links and nodes, are defined. The optimization problem that includes all aspects of the network, i.e. end-to-end connectivity, is formulated.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The topological reconfiguration of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network embedded into a backbone facility network that uses digital cross connect systems (DCSs) is addressed. The ATM topology consists of links (express pipes) obtained from the backbone facility via circuit switching through DCSs. The problem is formulated as a network optimization problem where performance is optimized, subject to capacity constraints posed by the underlying facility trunks. The variables in this problem are the selection of the express pipes, the routing of traffic on such pipes, and the allocation of bandwidth to pipes. Dynamic reconfiguration schemes where the embedded topology is periodically adjusted to track the fluctuations in traffic requirements are discussed. Such reconfigurations are shown to reduce congestion substantially.<<ETX>>},

year={1990},
volume={},
number={},
pages={215-220 vol.1},
abstract={A procedure for designing survivable, distributed communications networks is described. The approach uses a version of the cut-saturation algorithm modified to include considerations for survivability while adding and deleting link resources to meet specified throughput goals. This approach improves on the original design process, which made decisions on which link should be added or deleted based strictly on link utilization and link cost. Link distance was used for link cost when all links had the same capacity. Survivability considerations were directly integrated into the design process by using the information provided by the node decomposition (ND) and link tree (LT) indexes to indicate which links to add or to delete. If a link must be dropped, low LT index links make good candidates from a survivability standpoint. If a link must be added, low ND index nodes would be good termination points for adding the link. This replaces the original selection process with one oriented towards maintaining network survivability.<<ETX>>},

year={1990},
volume={},
number={},
pages={230-237 vol.1},
abstract={A scheme which allows the existence of two priority classes on a channel, each using a standard carrier-sense multiple-access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) protocol, is introduced. The two priority classes considered are labeled the high-priority class (HP) and the low-priority class (LP) of users. The scheme is based upon the principle that the exclusive access right to the channel is given to the HP users after each successful transmission from all users on the channel. This is accomplished by reserving the channel for a time window during which only HP users can contend for accessing the channel using the CSMA/CD protocol. If the channel is not used during that window or if it is used by more than one HP user (which results in a collision), it is released once again for use by both types of users. The equilibrium throughput and delay equations for both types of users are derived. The effect of HP users' percentage on the channel, the HP packet's length, the width of the reservation window, and the channel traffic on the throughput and delay for both types of users is investigated. The priority scheme introduced lends itself well to the introduction of multiple classes of priority users on the same channel.<<ETX>>},

pages={238-245 vol.1},
abstract={A collision protocol called piggyback Ethernet which is applicable for fast bus-type networks based on single, uniform, unsegmented, broadcast-type carriers is presented. Although piggyback Ethernet assumes that each station possesses certain global knowledge about the geometry of the network, it is argued that this knowledge can be acquired automatically at a reasonably small expense. The performance of the protocol for very heavy traffic is not worse than the performance of other protocols operating in a completely synchronized manner. The advantage this solution is its very good performance for light loads which is, for practical purposes, not worse than the performance of Ethernet. Moreover, compared to other protocols for fast networks, piggyback Ethernet has quite modest hardware requirements. The network is based on a straightforward bidirectional cable, each station has only one connection to the bus, and the actual length of the carrier is not bigger than the maximum distance between two stations.<<ETX>>},

pages={253-259 vol.1},
abstract={A modified carrier-sense multiple-access with collision detection (CSMA-CD) protocol which is suitable for high speed channels is presented and analyzed using the equilibrium point analysis (EPA) method. With the protocol each user has a finite buffer and does not transmit until it has accumulated a given number of packets, L. When this number is exceeded it will access the channel using a conventional CSMA-CD protocol and transmit all the packets in its buffer. This protocol is very simple to implement compared with multichannel protocols and results in higher throughput compared with slotted Aloha. The disadvantage is a larger delay, which is related to the parameter L, the packet arrival process, and the number of users. The delay can be reduced by dynamically controlling the parameter L and the retransmission probabilities of the protocol. The protocol is well suited for traffic arrival processes which are bursty where each burst of packets corresponds roughly to a message. Some performance results are given assuming a Bernoulli packet arrival process.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Exact results are presented on the mean waiting time in a nonsymmetric polling system with general service order table and gated service. The results are obtained using a generalization of the work of Ferguson and Aminetzah (see IEEE Trans. on Commun., vol.COM-33, p.223-31 , 1985). Pseudocycle times are defined, the relationship between cycle times and pseudocycle times is expressed, and the generating functions for the waiting times and the number of messages at the stations and at the pseudostations are obtained as functions of pseudocycle times. Equations are derived for the case of zero first two moments of the switch-over time at every station. Using numerical examples, a previously published pseudoconservation law is verified. The numerical results quantify the significant reductions in the waiting time and the queue occupancy at a station (particularly at high server utilizations) by listing it more frequently in the polling table.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An analysis of polling schemes with multiple servers is presented where the service discipline at each station is assumed to be of the nonexhaustive (limited) type, i.e. no more than one customer can be removed from a station per visit of a server. The times spent by servers to walk from station to station are assumed to be nonzero and are modeled by independent, identically distributed random variables. The arrival processes at each queue are assumed to be Poisson, and serving times are modeled with independent, identically distributed random variables with arbitrary PDF. The case in which at most one server and the case in which any number of servers can simultaneously attend a queue are separately considered. Under the assumption of balanced traffic (equal arrival rates at all stations), several results concerning the cycle analysis and the stability of such schemes are obtained. A simple, explicit expression that gives an approximation for the steady-state average customer waiting time is derived.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The nonblocking properties of the generalized parallel delta networks (GPDNs) and their application to the photonic switching environment are discussed. It is demonstrated that the crosstalk due to the switch crossover can be completely avoided by means of a proper dimensioning of the network parameters. A classification of the nonblocking properties is proposed. In particular, a nonblocking condition, called as strong, is defined. It establishes that two paths are not in conflict if they do not share any switching element. The strong nonblocking condition has been considered together with the traditional one. This second condition, called as weak because it is based on the unshareability of the interstage links, is normally applied in the electronic environment. The conditions which have to be satisfied so that a GPDN can be weakly and/or strongly nonblocking are found and demonstrated.<<ETX>>},

DQDB is analyzed in asymptotic conditions, i.e. bandwidth sharing among network nodes when each node is trying to seize all of the medium capacity. DQDB fairness and performance is investigated under a more realistic scenario. The results show that DQDB without the bandwidth balancing mechanism (BBM) is unfair and that the unfairness is dependent on the medium capacity and the bus length. When the BBM is enabled, DQDB fairness and performance, in the steady state, improve significantly. However, DQDB takes some time to achieve the steady state, during which time the node quality of service is degraded.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A two-level distribution network for broadcast and interactive video is proposed. This two-level design replaces a large switch by a network of smaller switches, facilitating switch growth and enhancing switch reliability. The second-level switches (or the local switches) can be located at convenient places in their respective service districts, reducing the overall circuit mileage of the video distribution system. Video requests can be proposed independently by the local switches, rendering a large call processor at the central switch unnecessary. A traffic model for this network is formulated, and the optimum capacities of the central and local switches are determined for a given blocking requirement. Adding a small crosspoint switch between the two levels allows the output ports of the central switch to be dynamically allocated to the local switches. It is shown that this sharing of output ports can significantly reduce the size of the central switch.<<ETX>>},

A broadcast algorithm for such a network that is tolerant of failures in the form of message loss is presented. The model used is based on the one introduced by Cidon et al. (see Proc. of Seventh Annual ACM Symp. on Principles of Distributed Comput., Toronto, Canada. P.75-89, 1988); the hardware functions assumed are simple enough to be implemented in high-speed logic. The basic idea is to forward broadcast messages directly in hardware, thereby avoiding software-introduced delays. Software intervention (possible only after the broadcasted message has already been forwarded) is required only to ensure termination in case of failures. With high probability, the broadcast will terminate in time O(n tau /sub max/), where n is the number of nodes and tau /sub max/ is an upper bound on (variable) message delivery time across a link.<<ETX>>},

pages={348-356 vol.2},
abstract={Multicast traffic encounters higher blocking probability than point-to-point traffic because of simultaneous output port contentions. To ensure adequate performance for multicast traffic, the authors develop and analyze a class of call scheduling algorithms via call splitting. Call splitting algorithms reduce output contention by generating smaller subcalls from a multicast call. It is shown that slot contention blocking is the predominant factor of blocking a multicast call, which suggests that call splitting may be an efficient strategy for a multicast call. The authors devise a deterministic call splitting algorithm and show that excessive call splitting can degrade performance because of the additional load introduced to the input ports. The authors also investigate an adaptive splitting algorithm which achieves performance approach the optimum by avoiding excessive call splitting.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A design of a reliable broadcast communication system for unreliable broadcast networks like Ethernet and radio networks is presented. The authors try to provide a partially ordering broadcast (PO) service in which every entity receives all messages from one entity in the same order. The PO protocol does not require the total ordering of received protocol data units (PDUs). In order to provide a reliable broadcast communication among multiple entities on an unreliable broadcast service, a data transmission procedure, the execution of which is controlled by all entities in a distributed scheme, is proposed. The correctness of the protocol is shown. The protocol can be very useful in designing and implementing distributed systems, such as distributed database systems and distributed operating systems.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An investigation is conducted of the problem of determining routing assignments in slotted Aloha packet radio networks to maximize the end-to-end throughput. It is assumed that the networks have an arbitrary topology and that the relative traffic requirements matrix is arbitrary. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem. Unfortunately, the problem is not a convex program, which explains why the development of an algorithm to find global optimal solutions has been so elusive. A heuristic algorithm is developed based upon ideas from resource directive decomposition. The heuristic is applied to several standard problems. The numerical results show that the method compares favorably to other methods in the literature.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A novel technique for setting up the Benes switch that has essentially optimal time complexity when implemented on a neural network is presented. This approach consists of defining distances between input or output ports and expressing the Banyan network's ability to realize a given permutation in terms of a distance matrix. This description allows a neural network implementation of the setup algorithm. It is shown that the neural network converges to a solution that will allow the switch to self-route the information according to the desired permutation. The time complexity of this operation is closer to optimal and the hardware simpler to implement than with previously presented algorithms.<<ETX>>},

pages={403-408 vol.2},
abstract={A novel packet forwarding technique is proposed. Low network delay is obtained through the use of a special nodal switching mechanism and a routing policy. A set of district paths called highways, each of which comprises concatenated links, is defined over a network. Nodes are configured so that packets directed to the output link belonging to the same highway as the input link are handled with high priority in exiting the node. Thus, the packets transferred along highways experience short delay times. Routing forces the packets to follow the paths, which consist mostly of the highways, to reach the destination nodes. Throughput-delay characteristics of this technique have been evaluated analytically. The results show its superior performance compared with conventional techniques.<<ETX>>},

In a generalized shuffle-exchange (GSE) network, 2/sup n/ inputs are first permuted by a shuffle such that an n-bit source address label is rotated left r'-bit positions to yield the destination address label. The exchange performs arbitrary permutations on 2/sup k/*2/sup k/ exchange switches. The GSE networks can emulate a variety of other networks, including orthogonally connected multidimensional cubes of all sizes, and they provide the possibility of incorporating alternate paths into networks without the addition of extra processing nodes or interconnections. Generalized shuffle-exchange networks are characterized herein by their connectivity, their diameter, and the number of alternate paths they permit.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A family of automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols that can be implemented through relatively simple hardware (one or more first in, first out, or FIFO, buffers and some limited state information) is considered. With a single FIFO buffer, the protocol is identical to a regular go-back-N. By increasing the number of FIFO buffers, a full selective repeat can be reached. The main result is to show that, for typical error rates, performance close to selective repeat can be obtained with two or three FIFO buffers. The family of protocols is described in detail, and the throughput is analyzed. For the two-buffer case, a closed-form solution is obtained, while for other cases, simulation results are given.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The horizontally oriented protocol structure (HOPS) is proposed. The horizontal structure, coupled with a small number of layers, eliminates unnecessary replication and processing of functions and lowers the unnecessary interprocess communication burden of the protocol execution-for example, unnecessary error detection for voice packets in integrated applications and unnecessary error detection in multiple layers for data applications are eliminated, the overhead associated with multi-peer-to-peer connection to multilayer architecture is substantially reduced, etc. The proposed architecture lends itself more naturally to full parallel implementation. Parallelism offers the potential of increased protocol processing rates, reduction in processing latency, and further reduction in processing overhead; and with the advances in VLSI, full parallel implementation becomes more and more feasible. The scheme also features selective functionality, which permits the protocol to easily adjust itself to the kind of performance demanded by the network-application requirements.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An analytical model for predicting the performance of protocol software implementation in a layered communication architecture is proposed. Each layer is modeled by a queuing network. The model is constructed by focusing the behavior of the protocol entity in a layer. A first come, first served (FCFS) server queue with preemptive priority is employed for an entity and an infinite-server queue for response time of acknowledge packets. Respective layer models are piled up by embedding the lower services in the infinite-server queue. From the perspective of end-to-end performance, the model provides a solution for the following problems, which arise in implementing a layered communication protocol: assigning each layer's process to a processor; giving priority to respective processes in each processor; and providing an error recovery service.

abstract={An analysis is made of the fault tolerance of a class of double-loop networks referred to as forward-loop backward-hop (FLBH) networks, in which each node is connected by unidirectional links to the node one hop in front of it and to the node S hops in back of it for some S. A measure of fault tolerance is described along with techniques based on Markov chains to calculate quickly and efficiently the upper and lower bounds on the fault tolerance of this network topology. The results of the calculations provide a more precise description of network fault tolerance than has been achieved with previously published techniques.<<ETX>>},

year={1990},

pages={520-526 vol.2},
abstract={The authors suggest and investigate a general input congestion control scheme that takes into account a broad spectrum of network issues. As a preventive congestion control strategy, a leaky-bucket-type scheme operating on a session basis that limits the session's average rate and the burstiness is proposed. This restrictive control is combined with an optimistic bandwidth usage scheme which works by marking packets into two different colors, green and red. The packets are marked so that the average green packet rate entering the network is at the reserved average rate. The average red packet rate represents traffic in excess of this guaranteed average rate and is sent to further utilize unused bandwidth in the network. Both types of packets are further filtered by a spacer which limits the peak rate at which the packets enter the network. The marked packets are then sent into the network, where they are treated according to their color, using at each intermediate node a simple threshold policy.<<ETX>>},

year={1990},
volume={},
number={},
pages={527-536 vol.2},
abstract={The process of packet clustering in a network with well-regulated input traffic is studied. Based on this study, a strategy for congestion-free communication in packet networks is proposed. The strategy provides guaranteed services per connection with no packet loss and an end-to-end delay which is a constant plus a small bounded jitter term. Therefore, it provides an attractive solution for the transmission of real-time traffic in packet networks. The strategy is composed of an admission policy imposed per connection at the source node and a particular queuing scheme, called stop-and-go queuing, practiced at the switching nodes. The admission policy requires the packet stream of each connection to possess a certain smoothness property upon arrival to the network, while the queuing scheme eliminates the process of packet clustering and thereby preserves the smoothness property as packets travel inside the network. Implementation of the stop-and-go queuing is simple, with little processing overhead and minor hardware modifications to the conventional FIFO (first in, first out) queuing structure.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A problem associated with overload control by packet discarding in integrated packet networks such as a broadband integrated services digital network (B-ISDN) is considered. The question of optimality in priority packet discarding is examined in order to minimize the service degradation associated with the discarding. An analysis model which is consistent with asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) operation of such a network is presented. It is shown how dynamic programming can be used with this model to find an optimal discarding policy, and initial results of such an analysis for queuing systems with a single buffer position are presented. It is shown by example that the optimal policy can perform significantly better over a wide range of parameter values than the default policy of discarding arriving packets only when the queue is full.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An investigation is conducted of the possibility of locally controlling short-term congestion for loss-tolerant but delay-sensitive traffic (such as packet voice) through selective discarding of packets based on the virtual work found by a packet on arrival to a queue (local deadlines). By analysis and simulation of a multistage virtual circuit, it is shown that this approach can cut voice-tolerable loss rates in half for high loads. It is also shown that the simple case of using the same local deadline throughout the network performs nearly as well as taking reduced interior traffic into consideration and optimizing loss performance over a set of heterogeneous local deadlines. As an example, the issue of establishing control parameters at call-setup time is also considered.<<ETX>>},

pages={552-560 vol.2},
abstract={The use of adaptors for protocol conversion in heterogeneous data networks with layered architectures is proposed. An adaptor is a form of protocol converter enabling a peer component of one protocol to simulate a peer of a different protocol. Adaptors have several advantages over other conversion architectures, especially gateway-type converters: they avoid bottlenecks at network boundaries, and a message is translated twice at most on its way from one peer to the other; adaptors are well-suited for conversion among multiple protocols; and the definition of an adaptor as the quotient of known components is simpler than for other converters, making it simpler to compute an adaptor algorithmically or to verify one derived heuristically. The approach is illustrated with an example involving three different connection-management protocols.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A modular approach is proposed for constructing a converter for two protocols that go through different phases, performing separate functions in each phase. The construction of such a converter consists of three steps: (1) the decomposition of protocols into distinct functions; (2) the construction of functional converters for each pair of functions selected by the converter designer; and (3) the merging of local functions with functional converters to construct the final converter. The final converter not only contains a common subset of functions of the two protocols, but also includes functionalities specified to each protocol.<<ETX>>},

pages={580-587 vol.2},
abstract={Each of the generated packets can have two different priorities (high- and low-priority packets). High-priority packets are assumed to have a more restrictive delay requirement than low priority ones. For such a system, the authors propose a class of synchronous random-access algorithms which use a small portion of the channel capacity for the announcements of the existence of high- or low-priority packets. The stability and throughput-delay performances of the algorithms are determined analytically for the cases when one or two minislots are used. Representative performance results are given and compared with a similar algorithm which does not use minislots. The algorithms give a delay advantage to the high-priority packet class without adversely affecting the delays of the low-priority packets. The algorithms use binary C-NC (collision versus noncollision) feedback, and the maximum throughput is 0.487 when two minislots are used.<<ETX>>},

Although the composite traffic, consisting of new transmissions (NTxs) and retransmissions (RTxs), is not Poisson, it can be approximated as such. Details for the throughput and the stability of the system are given based on a local Poisson approximation. Stability conditions are given for different levels of user side information.<<ETX>>},

The authors have previously shown that the analysis of a stochastic model of a maximum packing policy is equivalent to that of a fixed-route circuit-switched network. Thus, some of the performance measures in cellular communication systems can be obtained by using the well-developed exact simulation and approximation methods used in analyzing circuit-switched networks. Formal costs associated with each connection are used to show how dynamic channel assignment with maximum packing can improve the service and increase the total revenue. The results support an argument for the realization of the dynamic channel assignment and rearrangement in cellular communication systems.<<ETX>>},

The results show that increasing the number of output ports per output address (r) can significantly improve the performance of buffered as well as unbuffered switch modules. For acceptable performance, the difference in throughput between buffered and unbuffered switch modules is considerable. For buffered switch modules, an interesting observation is that although output-buffered switch modules have significantly better delay performance than input-buffered switch modules when n=gr, the performance difference is diminished as one deviates from these switch dimensions.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The author introduces a form of attack, a verifiable-test attack, in which an attacker obtains secret information, such as a password used in a protocol, without breaking the underlying cryptosystem. An investigation is made of the essence of a verifiable-text attack, and an algorithm for examining protocols and searching for vulnerabilities to such an attack is developed. Caution has to be exercised in certifying that a protocol is not vulnerable because a healthy protocol may become vulnerable when it interacts with another vulnerable or even healthy protocol.<<ETX>>},

pages={694-701 vol.2},
abstract={A comparison is made of the end-to-end delay performance of two service disciplines that a terminal adaptor (TA) can use to multiplex the pipelined synchronous native protocol frames arriving over the low-speed lines. In one scheme, the TA pipelines one synchronous frame at a time, waiting, if it needs to, for the successive link-access protocol D-channel (LAPD) packets from this one synchronous frame to accumulate. In the other scheme, the TA interleaves the LAPD packets from various synchronous frames. Using an analytical model for the first scheme, it is concluded that if the trunk speed (TA-to-network switch) to line speed ratio is greater than or equal to four, then over the range of useful loading, interleaved pipelining yields smaller mean delays than noninterleaved pipelining. If the ratio is less than four, interleaving yields larger mean delays for negative protocols which require a buildout delay at the egress TA.<<ETX>>},

Metacommunicating entities exchange partially specified communication rules. Each entity, or a metacommunication center, applies a standard composition principle on the individual partially specified rules in order to derive the complete protocol architecture.

pages={719-727 vol.2},
abstract={A study is made of the output queues of an M*N packet switch using a Markov-modulated flow model. The switching element is a central server which sequentially routes packets from the inputs to the outputs. The authors focus on systems where the server speed is such that the bulk of the queueing takes place in the output queues. For such systems, accurate sizing of the output buffers is an important design issue and requires a correct characterization of the arrival processes to the output buffers. The conventional point process approach neglects the impact of switching and transmission time. An attempt is made to account for these finite system speeds by using a Markov-modulated continuous flow to approximate the arrival process to an output queue. This model captures the dependency between arrivals at different outputs and reflects the fact that packet arrivals and departures are not instantaneous. The output queue content distribution is obtained, for both infinite and finite buffer systems, from the spectral expansion of the solution of a system of differential equations. Numerical examples and comparisons with the results of an M/M/1 approximation are presented.<<ETX>>},

pages={774-812 vol.2},
abstract={The optimal control of arrivals to a two-station token ring network is analyzed. By adopting a maximum system throughput under a system time-delay optimality criterion, a social optimality problem is studied under the assumption that both stations have global information (i.e. the number of packets in each station). The controlled arrivals are assumed to be state-dependent Poisson streams and have exponentially distributed service time. The optimality problem is formulated as a dynamic programming problem with a convex cost function. Using duality theory, it is then shown that the optimal control is switchover when both queues have the same service rate and sufficiently large buffers. Nonlinear programming is used to numerically approximate the optimal local controls for comparison purposes. The results obtained under global and local information can be used to provide a measure of the tradeoff between maximum throughput efficiency and protocol complexity. Numerical examples illustrating the theoretical results are provided.<<ETX>>},

The switch is flexible in that it can handle variable length packets, a large number of input/output channels, and a wide range of channel speeds. It can perform cut-through switching and thus decrease packet delay through the network. It allows the design of high-throughput frame-relay nodes, simplifying the design and management of large networks. Its use of a hardware-implemented dynamic scheme for allocating storage allows efficient utilization of buffer space.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The architecture and performance of fixed-node virtual channel (VC) routing in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks is studied.

Applying the fixed-node routing architecture in ATM networks has the advantages of more efficient use of network resources, better availability/reliability and performance, and the ability to support superrate services. The sequencing problem associated with this approach in conventional packet-switched networks can be easily solved in the ATM environment. An analysis is presented of the performance of this routing architecture for an internally nonblocking ATM switch with partially shared output buffers based on a discrete-time D/sup (A)//D/c/B queuing system for general input traffic. A D/sub 1/+ . . . +D/sub N//D/c/B queuing system is used for deterministic traffic.

The model also helps to establish some results about the complexity of finding optimal algorithms to locate a resource when the probability distribution for the location of the resource is known. It is shown that the optimization problem is NP-hard for general networks. An algorithm is developed for tree networks which can be specialized to polynomial algorithms for a class of trees. (The polynomial algorithms can be used as the basis of heuristic algorithms for general networks.) An application of this algorithm for path networks can be adapted to find optimal search algorithms for bidirectional ring networks.<<ETX>>},

The objective is to find the number of database copies and their locations that optimize the total operation cost. Both static and dynamic allocation environments are considered. The problem is formulated as a zero/one integer programming problem. Preliminary test results show that the algorithm has fast convergence and provides a tight lower bound for the optimal operational cost.

DPP is more decentralized and less deterministic than the MID allocation procedure.

Voice follows a modified version of time-division multiple-access (TDMA), whereas carrier-sense multiple-access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) is adopted for the channel access policy for data. The real-time requirement for voice is satisfied and a loss will not occur if the maximum number of calls is set properly. A fraction of the bandwidth is always reserved for data. Silence periods are detected and saved for data. Analytical results are derived by steady-state equivalent queuing models. Simulation results are close to analytical results.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A media access control (MAC) protocol for integrated services on a dual-ring high-speed LAN is proposed. The protocol supports real-time synchronous voice and video services and multilevel priority asynchronous data traffic types using a packet-switched operation. The most important service requirement for packetized real-time traffic is guaranteed periodic access to the network with a small delay variation. The requirement is met by periodic generation of synchronous service tokens. The effect of service interruptions due to the synchronous traffic, i.e. voice and video, on the asynchronous data traffic is investigated by means of analytical and simulation methods.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A novel multiplexing scheme for integrated networks characterized by the coexistence of circuit-switched and packet-switched traffic is described. The new scheme is realized by reinforcement of the basic movable boundary hybrid-switching technique by incorporating a packet queue-size dependent adaptive TASI (time assigned speech interpolation) mechanism. A detailed queuing model representation of the multiplexer is given, and an analytical evaluation of several performance parameters of interest, such as the blocking probability of the packet-switched subsystem, the freezeout probability of the circuit-switched subsystem, and the expected number of packets in the packet queue, is conducted. The results of some numerical studies are presented to illustrate the multiplexer performance under different conditions. Of particular significance is the tradeoff between the freezeout probability performance of the circuit-switched subsystem and the packet blocking performance of the packet-switched subsystem, which could be exploited in a systematic design of the integrated multiplexing scheme for specific applications.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Consideration is given to a multiaccess communications channel which is shared on an integrated circuit-switched and packet-switched basis. Applications include time-division multiplexing and demand-assigned/TDMA (time-division multiaccess) communication channels which are shared by circuit-switched services (such as isochronous voice) and packet-switched services (such as data). Frames of fixed duration are established and divided into two parts: one part is used for voice transmissions while the other part serves to accommodate packetized data traffic. These two parts are separated by a movable boundary, so that data traffic can use the frame capacity which is temporarily unoccupied by voice transmissions. An exact expression is derived for the mean packet system size and delay. To reduce the computational complexity involved in using this expression, simpler expressions for upper and lower bounds are derived for the mean packet system size and packet delay. Examples that demonstrate the tightness of these numerically efficient bounds are presented.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A study is made of the average delay and the blocking probability of a regulator with a finite buffer size fed with Poisson and batch Poisson streams. The blocking probability depends only on sigma and B through sigma +B where B is the buffer size and sigma is expressed as an integer multiple of the packet size. The provision of regulator buffers allows flexibility in the traffic control such that incoming traffic can be delayed during minor overloads and rejected during major overloads. In addition, the provision of regulator buffers allows the use of smaller network buffers, which are typically more expensive due to high-speed operation. Also studied is the packet departure process from the regulator. A four-parameter descriptor ( sigma , rho , C/sub a//sup 2/, lambda ) is proposed to characterize the output process of the regulator. In addition, formulas are proposed to construct the four-parameter descriptor for the output process of the multiplexer. Such descriptors may be useful in multihop situations. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approximations are close to the simulated values.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The suggested class-related rule (CRR) was tested for mixes of two and three different bursty service classes. Performance was evaluated at the ATM cell level in terms of effective assigned bandwidth with respect to the peak bandwidth allocation. The gains obtained using the CRR are significant for the various bursty classes investigated with burstiness values b>or=5. It was found that the CRR is a conservative approach, based on the extensive simulation of a wide range of cases and of the assumed traffic and multiplexing models. Performance of the CRR was then evaluated at the virtual call level in terms of call blocking probability in a group of ATM trunks with respect to the peak bandwidth allocation. It was found that the CRR gain at the virtual call level is greater than the CRR gain at the ATM cell level, thus increasing the attractiveness of using statistical bandwidth assignment. All the results reported require further careful verifications, in particular to test other types of service classes and cases of multiple streams mixed with bursty and variable-bit-rate traffic sources.<<ETX>>},

year={1990},
volume={},
number={},
pages={889-895 vol.3},
abstract={An algorithm for the decentralized control of traffic flow in multihop broadband ISDN and a concomitant algorithm for call setup are proposed. The approach in flow control is to strategically detain packets at points along their routes in anticipation of probable congestion ahead of them. The goal is to avoid buffer overflowing caused by concentrated packet accumulation at a single node on the network. A typical traffic control decision involves just two primitive operations: a READ and a logical AND. Hence, a submicrosecond execution time is expected. This quickness enables the traffic control to be implementable on the packet (or cell) level for broadband communications with a moderate packet size. This algorithm also strives for high utilization of broadband facilities and preserves the order among sequential packets. The concomitant algorithm for call setup is solely executed at the traffic originating node(s) and thus requires no internode communications. This leads to a simple process of calls setup that ensures the continuous flow of ongoing calls and, at the same time, avoids buffer overflowing.<<ETX>>},

Their integrability with real-time traffic such as voice and video is studied. With the help of a simulation model of a 150-Mb/s broadband packet network, the improvements in the performance of the different traffic types by using DSC are quantified.

abstract={A controlled flooding scheme for computer networks that retains the desired properties of flooding yet limits the extend of message flooding through the network is proposed.

A performance criterion is proposed, and the problem of assigning costs to links so that optimal performance is achieved is considered.

The latter, being computationally complex, can efficiently be solved only by heuristic algorithms, one of which is outlined.<<ETX>>},

pages={918-925 vol.3},
abstract={Two implementations of a fiber-optic packet-switched hypercube are proposed. In the first, each directed link is implemented with a fixed wavelength laser and photodetector, and all optical transmissions are wavelength multiplexed onto one or more fibers. In the second, the electronic crosspoint matrices within the nodes are eliminated by allowing each laser to be tunable over a range of log N wavelengths. Assume that a hot potato, or deflection, routing algorithm is used; as soon as a packet is received at a node, a routing decision is made and the packet is sent out. The node attempts to send the packet towards its destination. The analysis indicates that a hypercube, hot-potato routing offers essentially optimal performance for random traffic, regardless of how large the hypercube grows, and it significantly outperforms traditional shortest-path routing with buffering and flow control. A few variations, including an algorithm which gives priority to packets closer to their destinations and one which gives priority to various classes of traffic, are also proposed and analyzed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The problem of virtual circuit routing in data communication networks under nonstationary conditions is considered. A state variable modeling approach is adopted to describe the dynamic behavior of the possible paths for the virtual circuit through the network. The state model is developed by representing each link in a path as a set of nonlinear differential equations describing the dynamics of the virtual circuit and the network traffic in terms of time-varying mean quantities. An optimal control problem is formulated to determine the virtual circuit routing path which minimizes the number of packets in the network. The solution of the optimal control problem by Hamilton-Jacobi arguments is discussed leading to a threshold routing policy which can be implemented in a decentralized fashion. The performance of the routing algorithm is studied under both steady-state and nonstationary conditions, and its superiority over the performance of previous schemes in a dynamic load environment is demonstrated.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A preliminary generic architecture is proposed for a packet voice messaging system (PVMS) which provides 'answering machine' service in a packet-switched environment. Its performance is considered in light of constraints imposed by the required quality of stored speech. A critical element in determining this quality is overflow in the PVMS packet buffer, which buffers packets of voice samples delivered to the PVMS for storage. A two-dimensional Markov chain analysis of the buffer occupancy of the PVMS is developed. Mean values and distributions of buffer occupancy are derived and validated against simulation. From these distributions, the probability of packet loss due to buffer overflow can be estimated, and the buffer can be sized to restrict overflow to an acceptably low level. In addition, the disk block size can be chosen to balance the tradeoff between the packet buffer size and wasted disk space.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The three performance models studied differ primarily in the manner in which the superposition of the voice sources (i.e. the arrival process) is modeled. The first approach models the superimposed voice sources as a renewal process. The second approach is based on modeling the superimposed voice sources as a Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP). The choice of parameters for the MMPP captures aspects of the long-term correlation in the arrival process in a more intuitive manner and computes loss more accurately than previous approaches for computing the MMPP parameters. A fluid flow approximation for the superposition is evaluated on the basis of the technique of D. Anick et al. (1982). For all three approaches, the case of multiplexing voice sources over a T1-rate link is considered. Both the new MMPP model and the fluid flow approximation can provide accurate loss predictions for parameter ranges of practical interest. The modeling of buffer overflow for general arrival processes is addressed, and modeling approaches for analyzing finite-buffer multiplexers with general arrival and service processes in a network environment are outlined.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An investigation is made of voice packet loss behavior at both the destination and internodal links in a packet switched network. The fractional loss and blocking time periods for both are derived using a bivariate Markov model. The numerical results show that blocking due to the delay constraint at the destination can result in long periods of consecutive packet loss, which seriously degrade voice quality. This work indicates that the packets with excessive delay should be discarded at the internodal links, instead of blocked at the destination.

pages={969-981 vol.3},
abstract={The design principles of a ring network with spatial reuse are described. The goal is to provide the same functions as designs that do not permit spatial reuse and concurrent transmission. A distributed fairness mechanism for this architecture is presented. The basic fairness mechanism can be extended for implementing multiple priority levels and integrating asynchronous with synchronous traffic. The ring is full-duplex and has two basic modes of operation: a buffer insertion mode for variable-size packets and a slotted mode for fixed-size packets. As a result, this architecture is suitable for a wide range of applications and environments. Concurrent access and spatial reuse permit simultaneous transmissions over disjoint segments of a bidirectional ring and, therefore, can increase the effective throughput by a factor of four or more. The efficiency of this architecture does not degrade as the bandwidth and physical size of the system increase. The combination of a full-duplex ring, spatial reuse, a reliable fairness mechanism, and the exploitation of recent advances in fiber-optic technology are the basis for the Metaring network architecture.<<ETX>>},

The proposed interconnection using the switch eliminates the bottleneck problem and, depending on the bridge processing time, it can attain better delay performance than the bridge-connected system over a wide range of system parameters.<<ETX>>},

The WON, a multichannel, multihop lightwave network with tunable transceivers, is suitable for use as a metropolitan area network. A unique feature of the WON is that a great number of virtual topologies can be mapped onto a given physical topology. The problems of virtual- and physical-topology design in the WON are described, techniques for their solution are presented, and the interplay between these problems is studied.<<ETX>>},

pages={1014-1021 vol.3},
abstract={An inherent problem of conventional point-to-point wide area network (WAN) architectures is that they cannot translate optical transmission bandwidth into comparable user-available throughput due to the limiting electronic processing speed of the switching nodes. A solution to wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-based WAN networks that addresses this limitation is presented. The proposed lightpath architecture trades the ample bandwidth obtained by using multiple wavelengths for a reduction in the number of processing stages and a simplification of each switching stage, leading to substantially increased throughput. The principle of the lightpath architecture is the construction and use of a virtual topology network in the wavelength domain, embedded in the original network. A study is made of the embedding of virtual networks whose topologies are regular, using algorithms which provide bounds on the number of wavelengths, switch sizes, and average number of switching stages per packet transmission.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The multihop architecture, which provides a way of tapping the capacity potential available in lightwave networks, is described. Within this architecture, each network node is equipped with some small number of transmitters and receivers, each of which can communicate on one wavelength. Transmitters and receivers are connected to an optical medium, which is physically configured in such a way that the entire spectrum of wavelengths in use is potentially accessible by each node. Then, an assignment of transmit and receive wavelengths to each node defines the logical connectivity among nodes. Furthermore, the use of optically agile transceivers (i.e. slowly tunable lasers or optical filters) permits the logical connectivity to be updated in response to changing traffic patterns and failure/recovery of nodal transmitters and receivers. The flow and wavelength assignment problem is studied. Solutions in which the traffic flows over a derived connectivity diagram such that the largest flow on any link is minimized are sought. Examples of the resulting connectivity diagram and traffic flow are presented for selected nonuniform point-to-point traffic matrices.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Consideration is given to data networks carrying mixed low- and high-priority traffic. For such networks, the authors propose a synchronous limited sensing random access algorithm per channel, which gives a delay advantage to the high-priority traffic. The algorithm basically consists of two dynamically coupled window algorithms, one for the high- and one for the low-priority packets. Assuming limit Poisson user models for both the traffic classes, the authors optimize the windows of the mixed algorithm for: (a) throughput maximization under no specific delay constraints and (b) throughput maximization subject to expected delay constraints for high-priority traffic. For both cases, the delay characteristics of the algorithm are studied for the two classes of data traffic. With appropriate selection of the two window sizes, the algorithm can attain relatively high throughput, while it simultaneously maintains low expected per high priority packet delays, whose values are only slightly affected by the total traffic rate.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A simulation study of the performance of the dynamic token-passing bus access method, designed for real-time local area network applications, is presented. Using software simulation the author investigates the basic question of whether the IEEE 802.4 token bus protocol, through the use of the timed token rotation priority mechanism, guarantees an upper bound on the channel access delay of the highest-priority queues. It is shown that the interactions of the dynamic polling scheme and the timed token rotation service mechanism are influenced by the transient response of the dynamic polling scheme and can potentially lead to the case of channel underutilization. Having demonstrated the protocol's capability of handling asymmetric loads, the author investigates the extent to which the capability is affected by the service discipline used.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An interactive numerical solution to the waiting time distributions for asymmetric token-passing systems (of more than two queues) with a limited-one service policy is proposed. Customer service times and changeover times (incurred by the server to switch from one queue to another) have general distributions. A set of four embedded Markov chains is obtained by observing the system state at the instants of (customer) service beginning, service completion (server) visit beginning, and visit completion. Using results of Eisenberg (1972) the probability generating function (PGF) for the marginal queue-length distribution for each queue at a service completion is obtained. This PGF involves an unknown PGF for the system state probabilities at visit-completion epochs, where the latter are solved by a numerical technique based on discrete Fourier transforms. Thus, the waiting time distribution for each queue is found. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed approach. Areas for improvements and extensions of this numerical technique are also discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The LTPB (linear token passing bus) protocol is a timed token protocol designed by the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) to guarantee a specified (and usually low) latency delay for the highest-priority traffic class, even in the case of traffic peaks in other priority classes, fair access among all the stations connected to the bus, and an efficient use of the bus bandwidth. These requirements are met by requiring that each station regulate the token rotation time through a token holding timer and token rotation timers. No station faults, no modification of the logical ring, and no token loss are assumed. The behavior of the LTB protocol is analyzed under various traffic conditions. Performance evaluation is conducted using the simulation tool SPHINX. Rules are established for choosing timer values in order to achieve the required latency delay for any priority class for a given bus load. The optimum message size for file transfers is also determined. The main difference between LTPB and IEEE 802.4 in an error-free environment concerns the use of the token holding timer. How the conclusions can be applied to the IEEE 802.4 protocol is examined.<<ETX>>},

pages={1144-1155 vol.3},
abstract={A generating function approach is used. The queue has multiple deterministic servers with infinite buffer size. Each server represents a time slot on an ATM link for the transmission of one cell. The arrival process is modeled by a number of independent Markov chains, and each characterizes the stochastic properties of a different traffic type. The generating function of the queue is decomposed in order to separate the evaluation of the characteristic roots. Further, to characterize the great diversity of time scales of variation in multimedia traffic, the overall traffic arrivals are decomposed into multiple independent types. Each type is constructed by a number of i.i.d. two-state Markov chains and represents a different time scale of variation. Simple Kronecker product properties are then used to separate the evaluation of each individual root. As the system size becomes large, the main computational limit in this method is the memory size required to solve linear equations for the boundary terms. Complete solutions for the first two moments of the queue are constructed. In numerical examples, calculations are made of the mean and the variance of the queue for a four-dimensional Markov queueing process. A new concept of time-scale decomposition is also introduced.<<ETX>>},

All results are asymptotic in which the large parameter is lambda , the mean number of packets of the virtual circuit which may be processed and transmitted at a single node in an interval equal to the mean propagation delay. It is shown that K* approximately lambda +O( square root lambda ), where K* is the optimal window size. Also, in the optimal operating condition, the steady-state mean and standard deviation of the queue packets at individual nodes are O( square root K*). The constants associated with these asymptotic solutions are oblivious to the minutiae of the physical model and therefore universal; these constants have been computed.<<ETX>>},

pages={1164-1171 vol.3},
abstract={A high-speed, integrated service switch built around a banyan multistage interconnection network (MIN) with 4*4 elements is proposed and studied. The architecture is similar to that of the fast-packet/circuit (FPC) switch. It employs n bit-parallel lines in the MIN to reduce contention and is capable of supporting integrated voice-data-video communications. The tagged-job method is used to formulate a model for the 4*4 switching element, and it is noted that this technique extends directly to the analysis of larger n*n switching elements. Performance evaluation of the switch provides throughput and delay results for fast packet switching which supports voice and data and blocking-and-loss probability behavior for circuit-switched (CS) circuit setup which supports real-time traffic such as fixed-rate video. A performance comparison shows that this switch has a higher maximum throughput than but similar delay behavior to the FPC switch for packet switching. However, its blocking-and-loss probability for CS circuit setup is significantly smaller under identical traffic conditions.<<ETX>>},

year={1990},
volume={},

pages={1172-1180 vol.3},
abstract={A multiconnected ring is a ring-structured network in which each node is also connected by chords to other nodes of the ring. The span of a chord is the number of nodes counted between the endpoints of the chord (only one endpoint is included). A multiconnected ring is defined as being nested if it is rotationally symmetric and if the span of each chord is an integral multiple of the spans of each of the shorter chords. For local and metropolitan area networks, a nested multiconnected ring (NMCR) can be implemented as a multifiber ring network in which each node receives and transmits on a subset of the fibers in a bundle or cable. Because of the rotational symmetry, NMCRs permit an identical connector to be used at each node. A NMCR is one of several intermediary networks between a ring and a fully connected network. Under a performance criterion that takes throughput, equipment cost, and complexity into account, an optimized NMCR outperforms both its extreme counterparts. Although ShuffleNet multiconnected rings can provide higher throughput per node than NMCRs, the rotational symmetry and identical connectors of NMCRs make them preferable for applications with many nodes and lower throughput-per-node requirements.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Topics related to the service quality of a network made up of interconnected LANs are discussed. As the size of a network increases, so do reconfiguration times, thus reducing service availability, increasing frame loss, and leading to performance degradation. This degradation may be substantial if circumstances requiring reconfiguration occur frequently. Two types of networks are compared by assessing the parameters which directly affect the quality of service of the network. The first uses media access control (MAC) bridges based on the standard spanning tree algorithm; the second uses parallel MAC bridges, by means of which the network can be organized into islands, thus making reconfiguration selective. In both cases the bridged LAN is modeled according to the schemes suggested by systems reliability theory, which allows assessment of performance parameters directly affecting service quality, such as the mean time to failure (MTTF), performability, and availability.<<ETX>>},

pages={1188-1195 vol.3},
abstract={A simulation model is developed from which the effect of the retry time on the performance of Hubnet is studied. Results show that increasing the retry time does not always mean higher delay. It is shown that, for retry time values that are less than and are factors of the packet lengths, the mean delay is better than some lower retry time values subject to some range. Also, it is shown that, contrary to what was believed earlier, a packet in a Hubnet with a retry time which is a factor of the packet length is guaranteed transmission rights. These results are used to study a Hubnet with two priority classes, where the retry times are used for priority assignment. It is shown that a lower retry time does not always mean higher priority. It is shown that a class of users with a retry time value that is a factor of the packet length could have higher priority than a class of users with a lower nonfactor retry time value.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Two techniques that prioritize the common channel acknowledgment traffic are proposed and analyzed for packet switched cable systems that use carrier-sense multiple-access (CSMA) protocols. Closed-form expressions for the packet interdeparture time moment generating functions of both priority acknowledgement schemes are obtained, under a Poisson arrival model, to facilitate the performance comparisons with respect to the channel throughput and output variation coefficient. A generic p-persistent carrier-sense protocol is utilized to unify the treatments of the nonpersistent and 1-persistent CSMA protocols. A statistical test procedure is also introduced to evaluate the appropriateness of the Poisson arrival model. Slotted operation and nonslotted operation are treated, along with the use of collision detection (CD).<<ETX>>},

year={1990},
volume={},

pages={1213-1219 vol.3},
abstract={The server visits N queues in an arbitrary manner. Each queue is visited for a random period of time whose duration is sampled in advance. At the end of a visit period, either all customers of the attended queue leave the system (variant I) or only customers that were present in the queue upon the arrival of the server leave the system (variant II). A scheduling policy is a rule that selects the next queue to be visited by the server. When the controller has no information on the state of the system, it is shown, under homogeneous arrival assumptions, that a cyclic policy minimizes the expected number of customers in the system. When the controller knows the number of customers in each queue, it is shown that the so-called most-customers-first (MCF) policy minimizes, in the sense of strong stochastic ordering, the vector of the number of customers in each queue whose components are arranged in decreasing order. These results hold for variants I and II and are obtained under fairly weak statistical assumptions. This model has potential applications in videotex and time-division multiple-access systems.<<ETX>>},

Each input line is assumed to deliver fixed-length packets of information according to a generally distributed process whose parameters depend on the state of an underlying finite-state Markov chain associated with each of the input lines. A method for the derivation of the moments of the buffer occupancy is developed, and the first and second moments are derived. The mean packet delay introduced by the statistical multiplexer is derived through Little's theorem. The applicability of the analyzed multiplexer in packet communication systems is illustrated through a simple example, and numerical results are provided for this case.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A major problem is how to determine buffer capacity, and how to synthesize a service quality control scheme for both delay and loss probability so as to satisfy multiple grades of service requirements. This is because in multimedia communications systems, each medium may have its own grade of service requirements, and these requirements may differ greatly from medium to medium. A synthesis method is proposed based on a conservation law for an M/D/1 queue with finite capacity. The necessity of a buffer management scheme in a multimedia environment is discussed. The achievability of mean delay performance is examined on the basis of a conservation law for an M/D/1 queue with finite capacity.

In particular, they derive conditions under which networks due to Y.P. Ofman (1965) and C.D. Thompson (1978), N. Pippenger (1973), and J.S. Turner (1989) lead to nonblocking multirate distribution networks. The results include both rearrangeable and wide-sense nonblocking networks. The complexity of most of our nonblocking multirate networks is roughly twice that of the corresponding space division networks. The one exception has complexity that exceeds that of the corresponding space division network by a log log factor.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A broadband packet switch is described whose interconnection network is based on a Batcher-banyan structure. The switch, which is able to transfer up to M packets per slot to a given switch outlet, is provided with packet buffers both at input and output ports. A probe-ack contention resolution scheme is adopted to select the conflict-free paths for the packets to be transferred through the interconnection network. This scheme at the same time limits the access to the interconnection network to a number of packets such that the buffer overflow at the output queues never takes place. Restricting the packet loss so that it occurs only at input queues simplifies the control procedures and makes it possible to jointly optimize the packet storage capability at input and output queues.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The performances of centralized, fast packet switches based on the ShuffleNet and on multistage banyans are compared. Two cost criteria are used, viz., the number of crosspoints and the number of pin-limited ICs. The analytic comparison of the two networks built with arbitrary size infinite buffered nodes shows their cost performance to be similar. The analysis also provides the optimal node sizes for both the topologies. The best throughput per crosspoint is obtained with small nodes, but the best throughput per pin-limited IC is obtained with the largest possible nodes that can be built on an IC. With the IC criterion, for both the networks, small nodes are found to give small minimum delays (inside the network). With finite buffered nodes and a simple back-pressure flow control (like the one for the banyan network), the ShuffleNet based switch can have problems of congestion. It is also prone to deadlocks.<<ETX>>},
