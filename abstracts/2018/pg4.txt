abstract={Recent years have seen various acoustic applications on mobile devices, e.g. range finding, gesture recognition, and device-to-device data transport, which use near-ultrasound signals at frequencies around 18-24 kHz. Due to the fixed low sound sample rate and hardware limitation, the highest detectable sound frequency on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices is capped at 24 kHz, presenting a daunting barrier that prevents high-frequency ultrasounds from benefiting acoustic applications. To bridge this gap, we present iChemo, a technology that enables COTS mobile devices to sense high-frequency ultrasound signals. Specifically, we demonstrate how to detect the power spectral density (PSD) of a high-frequency ultrasound signal by customizing the coprime sampling algorithm on COTS devices. Through our prototype and evaluation on extensive mobile devices, we demonstrate that iChemo can sense the PSD of ultrasound at frequency of 60 kHz, which is over twice of the current sensible frequency threshold.},

abstract={Ensuring confidentiality of communication is fundamental to securing the operation of a wireless system, where eavesdropping is easily facilitated by the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. By applying distributed beamforming among a coalition, we show that a new approach for assuring physical layer secrecy, without requiring any knowledge about the eavesdropper or injecting any additional cover noise, is possible if the transmitters frequently perturb their phases around the proper alignment phase while transmitting messages. This approach is readily applied to amplitude-based modulation schemes, such as PAM or QAM. We present our secrecy mechanisms, prove several important secrecy properties, and develop a practical secret communication system design. We further implement and deploy a prototype that consists of 16 distributed transmitters using USRP N210s in a 20×20×3m3area. By sending more than 160M bits over our system to the receiver, depending on system parameter settings, we measure that the eavesdroppers failed to decode 30%-60% of the bits cross multiple locations while the intended receiver has an estimated bit error ratio of 3×10-6.},

pages={1997-2005},
abstract={In urban environments, mobile crowdsensing can be used to augment in-situ sensing deployments (e.g. for environmental and community monitoring) in a flexible and cost-efficient manner. The additional participation provided by crowdsensing enables improved data collection coverage and enhances timeliness of data delivery. However, as the number of participating devices/users increases, efficient management is required to handle the increased operational cost of the infrastructure and associated cloud services - exploiting spatiotemporal redundancy in sensing can help cost-efficient utilization of resources. In this paper, we develop solutions to exploit the mobility of the crowd and manage the sensing capability of participating devices to effectively meet application/user demands for hybrid urban sensing applications. Specifically, we address the spatiotemporal scheduling problem to create high-resolution maps (e.g. for pollution sensing) by developing a common framework to capture spatiotemporal impact of multiple sensor types that generate heterogeneous data at different levels of granularity. We develop an online scheduling approach that leverages the knowledge of device location and sensing capability to selectively activate nodes and sensors. We build a multi-sensor platform that enables data collection, data exchange, and node management. Prototype deployments in three different campus/community testbeds were instrumented for measurements. Traces collected from the testbeds are used to drive extensive large scale simulations. Results show that our proposed solution achieves improved data coverage and utility under data constraints with lower costs (30% fewer active nodes) than naive approaches.},

title={Adaptive Demodulation for Wireless Systems in the Presence of Frequency-Offset Estimation Errors},
year={2018},
volume={},

pages={1592-1600},
abstract={Carrier frequency offset (CFO) arises from the intrinsic mismatch between the operating frequencies of the transmitter and the receiver, as well as their relative speeds (i.e., Doppler effect). Despite advances in CFO estimation techniques, estimation errors are still present. Residual CFO creates time-varying phase error. Modern wireless systems, including WLANs, 5G cellular systems, and satellite communications, use high-order modulation schemes, which are characterized by dense constellation maps. Accounting for the phase error is critical for the demodulation performance of such schemes. In this paper, we analyze the post-estimation probability distribution of residual CFO and use it to develop a CFO-aware demodulation approach for a set of modulation schemes (e.g., QAM and APSK). For a given distribution of the residual CFO, symbols with larger amplitudes are less densely distributed on the constellation map. We explore one important application of our adaptive demodulation approach in the context of PHY-layer security, and more specifically modulation obfuscation (MO) mechanisms. In such mechanisms, the transmitter attempts to hide the modulation order of a frame's payload from eavesdroppers, which could otherwise exploit such information to breach user privacy or launch selective attacks. We go further and complement our CFO-aware demodulation scheme by optimizing the design of a low-complexity MO technique with respect to phase errors. Our results show that when combined, our CFO-aware demodulation and optimized MO techniques achieve up to 5 dB gain over conventional demodulation schemes that are not obfuscated and are oblivious to residual CFO.},

abstract={Searchable encryption enables searches to be performed on encrypted documents stored on an untrusted server without exposing the documents or the search terms to the server. Nevertheless, the server typically learns which encrypted documents match the query-the so-called access pattern-since the server must return those documents. Recent studies have demonstrated that access patterns can be used to infer the search terms in some scenarios. In this paper, we propose a framework to protect systems using searchable symmetric encryption from access-pattern leakage. Our technique is based on d-privacy, a generalized version of differential privacy that provides provable security guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary background knowledge.},

pages={998-1006},
abstract={SDN programming has been challenging because programmers have to not only implement the control logic, but also handle low-level details such as the generation of flow tables and the communication between the controller and switches. New generation of SDN with protocol oblivious forwarding and multi-table pipelining introduces even more low-level details to consider. We propose POMP, the first SDN programming environment supporting both protocol oblivious forwarding and automatic multi-table pipelining. POMP applies the static taint analysis technique to automatically infer compact and efficient multi-table pipelines from a data-plane agnostic network policy written by the programmer. The runtime system tracks the execution of the network policy, and automatically generates table entries. POMP also introduces a novel notion of dependent labels in the taint analysis, which, combined with the runtime information of the network policy, can further reduce the number of table entries. Like P4, POMP supports protocol-oblivious programming by providing a network protocol specification language. Parsers of packets can be automatically generated based on the protocol specification. POMP supports two main emerging SDN platforms, POF and P4, therefore network policies written in POMP are portable over any switches supporting POF or P4.},

pages={962-970},
abstract={360-degree video has the potential to transform the video streaming experience by providing a more-immersive environment for users to interact with than standard streaming video. This experience is hampered, however, by high bandwidth requirements resulting from the extra information associated with the 360-degree frames. Because users cannot see this full 360-degree view, but the full view is transmitted in the majority of 360-degree streaming systems, there is much potential to reduce wasted bandwidth in this domain. We propose ClusTile, a tiling approach formulated to select a set of tiles that allows minimal bandwidth needed to be used when streaming 360-degree video over an expected set of views. These tiles are selected by solving a set of integer linear programs (ILPs) independently on clusters of collected user views. The clustering approach reduces computation requirements of the ILPs to practical levels. Tilings computed from ClusTile can save up to 76% bandwidth compared to standard 360-degree streaming and up to 52% bandwidth compared to best-performing fixed tiling schemes.},

abstract={Mobile devices such as smartphones are enabling users to generate and share videos with increasing rates. In some cases, these videos may contain valuable information, which can be exploited for a variety of purposes. However, instead of centrally collecting and processing videos for information retrieval, we consider crowdprocessing videos, where each mobile device locally processes stored videos. While the computational capability of mobile devices continues to improve, processing videos using deep learning, i.e., convolutional neural networks, is still a demanding task for mobile devices. To this end, we design and build CrowdVision, a computing platform that enables mobile devices to crowdprocess videos using deep learning in a distributed and energy-efficient manner leveraging cloud offload. CrowdVision can quickly and efficiently process videos with offload under various settings and different network connections and greatly outperform the existing computation offload framework (e.g., with a 2× speed-up). In doing so CrowdVision tackles several challenges: (i) how to exploit the characteristics of the computing of deep learning for video processing; (ii) how to parallelize processing and offloading for acceleration; and (iii) how to optimize both time and energy at runtime by just determining the right moments to offload.},

abstract={Full-duplex (FD) wireless is an attractive communication paradigm with high potential for improving network capacity and reducing delay in wireless networks. Despite significant progress on the physical layer development, the challenges associated with developing medium access control (MAC) protocols for heterogeneous networks composed of both legacy half-duplex (UD) and emerging FD devices have not been fully addressed. Therefore, we focus on the design and performance evaluation of scheduling algorithms for infrastructure-based heterogeneous networks (composed of UD and FD users). We develop the hybrid Greedy Maximal Scheduling (U-GMS) algorithm, which is tailored to the special characteristics of such heterogeneous networks and combines both centralized GMS and decentralized Q-CSMA mechanisms. Moreover, we prove that H-GMS is throughput-optimal. We then demonstrate by simple examples the benefits of adding FD nodes to a network. Finally, we evaluate the performance of U-GMS and its variants in terms of throughput, delay, and fairness between FD and UD users via extensive simulations. We show that in heterogeneous UD-FD networks, U-GMS achieves 5-10x better delay performance and improves fairness between HD and FD users by up to 50% compared with the fully decentralized Q-CSMA algorithm.},

abstract={Modern datacenter schedulers apply a static policy to partition resources among different tasks. The amount of allocated resource won't get changed during a task's lifetime. However, we found that resource usage during a task's runtime demonstrates high dynamics and it only reaches full usage at few moments. Therefore, the static allocation policy doesn't exploit the dynamic nature of resource usage, leading to low system resource utilization. To address this hard problem, a recently proposed task-consolidation approach packs as many tasks as possible on the same node based on real-time resource demands. However, this approach may cause resource over-allocation and harm application performance. In this paper, we propose and develop ECS, an elastic container based scheduler that leverages resource usage variation within the task lifetime to exploit the potential utilization and parallelism. The key idea is to proactively select and shift tasks backward so that the inherent paralleled tasks can be identified without over-allocation. We formulate the scheduling scheme as an online optimization problem and solves it using a resource leveling algorithm. We have implemented ECS in Apache Yarn and performed evaluations with various MapReduce benchmarks in a cluster. Experimental results show that ECS can efficiently utilize resource and achieves up to 29% reduction on average job completion time while increasing CPU utilization by 25%, compared to stock Yarn.},

pages={1898-1906},
abstract={We consider the multichannel opportunistic access problem, in which a user decides, at each time slot, which channel to access among multiple Gilbert-Elliot channels in order to maximize his aggregated utility (e.g., the expected transmission throughput) given that the observation of channel state is error-prone. The problem can be cast into a restless multiarmed bandit problem which is proved to be PSPACE-Hard. An alternative approach, given the problem hardness, is to look for simple channel access policies. Whittle index policy is a very popular heuristic for restless bandits, which is provably optimal asymptotically and has good empirical performance. In the case of imperfect observation, the traditional approach of computing the Whittle index policy cannot be applied because the channel state belief evolution is no more linear, thus rendering the indexability of our problem open. In this paper, we mathematically establish the indexability and establish the closed-form Whittle-index, based on which index policy can be constructed. The major technique in our analysis is a fixed point based approach which enable us to divide the belief information space into a series of regions and then establish a set of periodic structures of the underlying nonlinear dynamic evolving system, based on which we devise the linearization scheme for each region to establish indexability and compute the Whittle index for each region.},

abstract={Future services and applications, such as Tactile Internet, coordinated remote driving or wireless controlled exoskeletons, pose serious challenges on the underlying networks and IT platforms in terms of reliability, latency, or capacity, just to mention a few. Towards those services, virtualization is a key enabler from both technological and economic aspects which significantly reshaped the IT and networking ecosystem. On the one hand, cloud computing and the services based on that are evident results of last years' efforts; on the other hand, networking is in the middle of a momentous revolution and important changes mainly driven by Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN). In order to enable carrier grade network services with strict QoS requirements, we need a novel data plane supporting high performance and flexible, fine granular programmability and control. As the network functions (implemented by virtual machines or containers) use the same hardware resources (cpu, memory) as the components responsible for networking, we need a low-level resource orchestrator which is capable of jointly controlling these resources. In this paper, we propose a novel resource orchestrator (RO) for a data plane making use of open source components such as, Docker, DPDK and OVS. Our goal is threefold. First, we propose a novel data plane resource model which is capable of abstracting several hardware architectures. Second, we provide an adapter module which can automatically discover the underlying hardware and build the model on-the-fly. Third, we design and implement a novel RO building on the aforementioned components and a publicly available Service Graph embedding engine. As a proof of the concept, two software switches (OVS, ERFS) are adapted and different hardware platforms are evaluated},

abstract={TOR is a well-known and established anonymous network that has increasingly been abused by services distributing and hosting content, in most cases images and videos, that are illegal or morally deplorable (e.g., child pornography content). Law enforcement continually tries to identify the users and providers of such content. State of the art techniques to breach TOR's anonymity are usually based on passive and active network traffic analysis, and rely on the ability of the deanonymization entity to control TOR's edge communication. Despite this, locating hidden servers and linking illegal content with those providing and spreading this content remains an open and controversial issue. In this paper, we describe Inflow, a new technique to identify hidden servers based on inverse flow watermarking. Inflow exploits the influence of congestion mechanisms on the traffic passing through the TOR network. Inflow drops bursts of packets for short time intervals on the receiving side of a traffic flow coming from a hidden server and passing through the TOR network. Packet dropping affects the TOR flow control and causes time gaps in flows observed on the hidden server side. By controlling the communication edges and detecting the watermarking gaps, Inflow is able to detect the hidden server. Our results, obtained by means of empirical experiments performed on the real TOR network, show true positive rates in the range of 90 to 98%.},

pages={135-143},
abstract={Many emerging sensor network applications operate in challenging environments wherein sensor nodes do not always have connected paths to the base station. Data generated from such intermittently connected sensor networks therefore must be stored inside the network for some unpredictable period of time before uploading opportunities become available. Consequently, sensory data could overflow limited storage capacity available in the entire network, making discarding valuable data inevitable. To overcome such overall storage overflow in intermittently connected sensor networks, we propose and study a new algorithmic problem called data aggregation for overall storage overflow (DA02). Utilizing spatial data correlation that commonly exists among sensory data, DAO2employs data aggregation techniques to reduce the overflow data size while minimizing the total energy consumption. To solve DAO2, we uncover a new graph theoretic problem called multiple traveling salesman walks (MTSW), and show that with proper graph transformation, the DAO2is equivalent to the MTSW. We prove that MTSW is NP-hard and design a (2-1.)-approximation q algorithm, where q is the number of nodes to visit (i.e., the number of sensor nodes that aggregate their overflow data). The approximation algorithm is based on a novel routing structure called minimum q-edge forest that accurately captures information needed for energy-efficient data aggregation. We further put forward a heuristic algorithm and empirically show that it constantly outperforms the approximation algorithm by 15% -30% in energy consumption. Finally, we propose a distributed data aggregation algorithm that can achieve the same approximation ratio as the centralized algorithm under some condition, while incurring comparable energy consumption.},

Each user either explores a channel to learn the channel statistics, or exploits the channel with the highest expected reward based on information collected so far.
