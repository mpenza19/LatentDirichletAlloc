abstract={A family of queues for which the service time B/sub n/ of customer n depends on the interarrival time I/sub n/ between customers n-1 and n and the random variables I/sub n/ and B/sub n/ exhibit a proportionality relation is studied. In particular, the focus is on dependencies that arise naturally in communication systems, where the finite speed of the communication links constrains the amount of data that can be received in a given time interval. The simple case of a deterministic proportionality relation between the service time of a customer and its preceding interarrival time is considered and extended to allow the addition of an independent, generally distributed overhead to the service time. Several models that capture the on-off behavior of communication links in packet networks are then addressed. In all cases, expressions for the delay experienced by a packet in the system and illustrative numerical examples are provided.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The problem of guaranteeing synchronous message deadlines in communication networks using the timed token medium access control protocol is studied. To ensure the transmission of synchronous messages before their deadlines, synchronous capacities must be properly allocated to individual nodes. A class of local synchronous capacity allocation schemes, which allocate the synchronous capacity to a node without using information about messages on the other nodes, is developed, analyzed, and evaluated in terms of the ability of the schemes to guarantee message deadlines. It is shown that one of the local allocation schemes proposed can achieve the same performance as that of the best global allocation scheme known to date.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Two mechanisms for shaping private network traffic in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) are proposed and analyzed. The shapers utilize the information about the network policer and implement a form of priority service to assure satisfactory levels of cell loss and delay for traffic streams with differing service requirements multiplexed into a policed ATM virtual path. The performance of the shapers is analyzed using stochastic-fluid methods and Markov-modulated models of bursty traffic sources. The numerical results illustrate the performance benefits and flexibility obtainable through the use of the proposed shapers in comparison to a simple policed path without traffic shaping.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Reconfiguration capability in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks and its ability to reduce ATM cell losses are studied. An implementation that restricts the transmission of ATM cells of an O-D pair to certain channels in each physical link in a simple path from origin to destination is proposed. The joint topology, discrete capacity, and routing problem in a reconfigurable ATM network is formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer programming problem. It is proven that this problem with integrality constraints relaxed can be simplified to a convex programming problem, providing a method for computing a lower bound on the original problem. An algorithm is developed to solve the nonlinear mixed integer programming problem. In computational experiments, the reconfiguration capability decreased the total cell losses by more than 50%.<<ETX>>},

volume={},

pages={128-135 vol.1},
abstract={A test sequence generation method is proposed for testing the conformance of a protocol implementation to its specification in a remote testing system, taking both external synchronization and input/output operation costs into consideration. The method consists of a set of transformation rules that constructs a duplexU digraph from a given finite state machine (FSM) representation of a protocol specification and a heuristic algorithm that finds a rural postman tour in the duplexU digraph to generate a synchronizable test sequence utilizing multiple UIO sequences. If the protocol satisfies a specific property, the heuristic algorithm yields a minimum-cost test sequence. The X.25 DTE and ISO Class 0 Transport protocols are proved to possess this specific property. otherwise, the heuristic algorithm yields a test sequence whose cost is within a bound from the cost of the minimum-cost test sequence. The bound for the test sequence generated from the Q.931 Network-side protocol is shown to be the cost sum of an input/output operation and an external synchronization operation.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An approach for conformance testing of protocols specified as a collection of communicating finite state machines (FSMs) with two parts, pruning and a guided random walk procedure, is presented. First the protocol is pruned to various sets of machines; each set provides only one service. This significantly reduces the test sequence length. Then a guided random walk procedure that attempts to cover all transitions in the component FSMs is used. The results of applying the procedure to the full-duplex alternating bit protocol and the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) adaptation layer convergence protocol are presented. For the ATM adaptation layer, 99% of component FSMs' edges can be covered in a test with 11692 input steps. Previous approaches cannot generate conformance tests for standard protocols (such as ATM adaptation layer) specified as a collection of communicating FSMs.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present an approach that combines control flow and data flow analysis techniques to generate unified test sequences (UTSs) for testing protocols modeled as an extended finite-state machine (EFSM).

A transition dependence graph is proposed to represent the dependence relations between transitions needed to construct the test sequences.

pages={82-89 vol.1},
abstract={In previous approaches to routing multicast connections in networks, the emphasis has been on the source transmitting to a fixed set of destinations (the multicast group). There are some applications where destinations will join and leave the multicast group. Under these conditions, computing an 'optimal' spanning tree after each modification may not be the best way to proceed. An alternative is to make modest alterations to an existing spanning tree to derive a new one. An extreme, though nonoptimal, variation of this is to use minimal cost source to destination routing for each destination, effectively ignoring the existing multicast tree. The authors examine just how nonoptimal these trees are in random general topology networks and conclude that they are worse by only a small factor. The factor is reduced still further if a hierarchy is imposed on the random network to give a more realistic model.<<ETX>>},

The output stream of the multiplexer again falls into the class. The exact formulas allow evaluation of the error in approximations such as a heavy traffic diffusion approximation. Both continuous-time and discrete-time models are treated. The Pollaczek-Khinchine formula for the mean amount of work in an M/G/1 queue is retrieved as a limiting case.<<ETX>>},

pages={18-27 vol.1},
abstract={A wideband source in high speed networks is typically represented by a binary random process. The second-order properties of each binary source are characterized here by a multistate Markov-modulated Poisson process. A comprehensive numerical study is carried out to identify the individual effect of source second-order dynamics on queue length and loss rate. The concept of input power spectrum is then developed as a unified source measurement for multimedia traffic queuing analyses. The authors thoroughly explore the relationship between the source second-order dynamics in the time domain and the input power spectrum in the frequency domain, as well as its overall impact on system performance.<<ETX>>},

pages={10-17 vol.1},
abstract={The steady-state performance of generic high-speed queuing system with priority traffic is studied, using the Markov modulated fluid models. the focus is on systems with traffic partitioned into two priorities according to a splitting factor alpha , so that low priority traffic can be discarded when congestion occurs. The results are used to further study issues of congestion control with priority traffic. In particular, the expected values, waiting times, variances of the buffer contents, and tail distributions are evaluated. It is found that the waiting time is more sensitive to changes of alpha than the buffer contents. This shows that for time-constrained traffic, the priority assignment is important for properly balancing the tradeoff between packet loss and delays. This model can be considered as a direct extension of the fluid-flow model to include priorities.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A framework for studying a stream of traffic or a message as it is transferred over an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) connection was previously proposed by the authors (1991). A message is modeled as a deterministic fluid flow, and an ATM node is modeled as a server that allocates bandwidth among concurrent messages. The key concept is that of the burstiness curve of an incoming message, which gives the buffer size needed if the message is served at rate mu . It is shown there that the fixed rate, the leaky bucket, and the affine server are burst reducing. The burstiness bound for each of these servers is presented. A sequence of identical affine servers is related to a fixed rate server, and it is suggested how quality-of-service parameters can usefully be based on the burstiness curve.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A slot interleaved multiple access (SIMA) scheme for distributed-queue dual-bus (DQDB) metropolitan area networks is proposed. In this scheme, all the active nodes will access the slots in an interleaved fashion. This scheme is very efficient for solving the bandwidth domination problem and the priority domination problem, which cannot be solved readily by the DQDB medium access control (MAC) protocol with a bandwidth balancing mechanism. An enhanced SIMA (ESIMA) scheme is proposed to solve the bandwidth allocation problem, which cannot be solved by the DQDB MAC protocol. Simulation results show that SIMA and ESIMA perform much better than the DQDB MAC on throughput as well as the access delay.<<ETX>>},

pages={1059-1066 vol.3},
abstract={The problem of optimal buffer space priority control in an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network node is studied. The buffer of a transmission link is shared among the cells of several traffic classes waiting for transmission through the link. When the number of cells to be stored in the buffer exceed the available buffer space, certain cells have to be dropped. Different traffic classes have different sensitivities to cell losses. By appropriate selection of the classes of cells that are dropped in case of overflow, the more sensitive classes can be made to suffer smaller cell losses. Arriving cells might be blocked from entering the system or they may be dropped after they are already in the buffer. Depending on the control that is on the system, three classes of policies are distinguished. In each one, policies that schedule the buffer allocation in some optimal manner are identified.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Buffering policies that provide different loss priorities to packets/cells with no change in packet ordering (space priority disciplines) are studied. These policies are motivated by the possible presence, within the same connection, of packets with different loss probability requirements or guarantees. Examples of such applications are voice and video coders that generate information of unequal importance, and rate control mechanisms that mark excess traffic with a low priority rate violation tag. The focus is on the identification and evaluation of buffering policies that can guarantee performance, i.e. loss probability, to high priority packets irrespective of the traffic intensity and arrival patterns of low priority packets, while preserving the original ordering among packets. Such policies are termed protective policies.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The results of a study to determine the effects of link failures on network performance are presented. The network studied is a virtual-circuit-based packet-switched wide area network. A generic queuing framework is developed to study the effect of failures, and the subsequent traffic restoration, on network performance. In general, the congestion resulting after a failure is a transient phenomenon. Hence, a numerical-method-based nonstationary queuing analysis is conducted in order to quantify the effects of failures in terms of the transient behavior of queue lengths and packet loss probabilities. A bounding relationship is developed whereby a network node can determine whether or not congestion will occur as the result of traffic restoration after a failure.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present a predictive congestion control policy for carrying data traffic in the presence of real-time traffic that has stringent delay requirements, such as voice and video traffic. The predictive policy attempts to predict the buffer content of a node at some time in the future. The policy is based on information exchange between adjacent nodes of the network. The cross traffic is characterized by its mean rate, its variance, and the correlation, and the performance of the scheme is studied over a wide range of cross traffic parameter values. The effect of higher link speeds and larger propagation delays on the performance is studied. The predictive policy is compared to other policies. The investigation shows that predictive control policy performs significantly better than static or adaptive end-to-end rate control policies.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The probability distribution of the shortest path cost from a source node to an arbitrary destination node is considered for a random network model consisting of a complete digraph with positive integer random edge costs. Edge costs are chosen according to a common probability distribution for each direction. For this model, the joint distribution of the number of nodes which have a given sequence of shortest path costs from an arbitrary source node is determined explicitly. An expression is then obtained for the distribution of the shortest path cost between two arbitrary nodes using this joint distribution. The main result is the derivation of tight bounds and a sharp limit result for the distribution of the shortest path cost as the number of nodes tends to infinity. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate these results.<<ETX>>},

abstract={It is shown that implementing self-stabilizing versions of standard ARQ (automatic-repeat-request) protocols, such as stop-and-wait or go-back-n, would require knowledge of a bound on the maximum delay or maximum memory of the communication channel involved. An alternative approach to self-stabilizing ARQ that incorporates a delay or memory bound directly as part of the communication model is given. Two ARQ protocols are presented that self-stabilize by using one bit of overhead in each transmitted message. The protocols operate exactly like standard stop-and-wait ARQ except that when a fault places them in an incorrect (unsafe) state, the additional bit in the protocol messages allows automatic recovery.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Link-state updating in communication networks undergoing topological changes is addressed. It is concluded that the best way of disseminating link-state information is through event-driven (ED) updating, and it is shown how to overcome the traditional drawbacks of ED updating. An efficient algorithm that extracts the maximum implicit information from ED topology updates by computing the latest time for which each processing node can be certain of the state of each network link is given. It is shown that the information obtained is equivalent to that obtained by continuous flooding of link-state information. A method that allows each node to refresh the above information continuously without running the algorithm more than once for each received update is presented, as is an approximate version of the algorithm that reduces communication overhead by limiting the radii of propagation.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The store-and-forward deadlock problem in packet switching networks is considered. Most of the previous work addressed this issue using reserved buffers, and most algorithms, with the exception of that given by J. Blazewicz et al. (1987) (the BBG algorithm), use more reserved buffers than necessary, implying that each node does not have the maximum flexibility in message routing. It is shown that the BBG deadlock prevention algorithm can generate an unbounded number of backtracked messages. A deadlock detection and resolution algorithm that allows a minimum number of buffers to be reserved and minimizes the number of backtracked messages at the end of each detection and resolution is presented. It is shown that in the worst case, only O( mod E mod ) backtracked messages can be generated as a result of this algorithm, and that each backtracked message is backtracked only one hop.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An optical buffer shift register based on a set of fiber delay lines is presented, with the goal of providing cell storage and queuing in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) photonic switches. The concept of multiwavelength cell buffering is adopted, to realize a shared buffer with a storage capacity equivalent to a set of shift registers. Since only one wavelength-encoded cell must enter one delay line at each time slot, contention resolution is necessary to determine the queuing order between the incoming cells. The use of optical fibers as delay lines and semiconductor optical amplifiers as gates associated with passive splitters to realize buffering and time-switching has been demonstrated. An experimental setup has been implemented at 600 Mb/s and operates without guard bands between packets. The low penalty observed shows that system synchronization and reliability are good.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A method for path allocation for use with three-stage ATM switches that feature multiple channels between the switch modules in adjacent stages is described. The method is suited to hardware implementation using parallelism to achieve a very short execution time. This allows path allocation to be performed anew in each time slot. A detailed description of the necessary hardware is presented. This hardware counts the number of cells requesting each output module, allocates a path through the intermediate stage of the switch to each cell, and generates a routing tag for each cell, indicating the path assigned to it.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A variable-bit-rate (VBR) MPEG video compression encoder is introduced, and the performance of a statistically multiplexed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network supporting a number of such VBR video sources is evaluated. Bit-rate characteristics obtained from a detailed simulation are provided for a VBR MPEG encoder for CCIR601 video (operating in the 5-10 Mb/s regime) appropriate for medium-quality multimedia or broadcasting applications. The results presented include bit-rate traces and signal-to-noise-ratio data for typical test sequences, along with summary statistics such as the marginal distribution of frame rate. Data from a study of statistical multiplexing on an ATM network are also given. Simulation results for an ATM statistical multiplexer with N>>1 VBR MPEG sources are presented in terms of key performance measures such as cell loss rate and delay versus throughput. The results confirm that ATM channel efficiencies of approximately 80-90% can be obtained at reasonable cell loss rate and delay levels.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Results of a simulation study of the potential multiplexing gains from using variable-bit-rate encoding to multiplex video teleconferencing traffic over an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network are presented. Simulated traffic from several video teleconferences was fed into a buffer and multiplexed onto a higher speed output line. The study observed the cell loss resulting from buffer overflow. The spacings between the start times for the individual video conferences are found to have a large role in determining the aggregate cell-loss-rate seen by the collection of calls. After the cell-loss-rate becomes non-negligible, it grows rapidly as a function of the number of input lines. The cell losses are not distributed uniformly over time but are clustered, with the consequence that the probability that a call is loss free is much better than indicated by the cell-loss-rate.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Results and observations gathered while implementing the ANSI T1M1.5 GNM-T1.214 standard within an object-oriented database management system (ODBMS) framework are discussed. The generic network model (GNM) proposes a dynamic network modeling methodology that encompasses a wide spectrum of managed telecommunication network resources. Within the GNM, managed telecommunication resources are modeled from building blocks of lower-level resource elements (logical or physical). The complex relationships between GNM resource elements are described either by specialization/generalization or user/containment; therefore, an ODBMS is well suited for implementation of the GNM as compared to conventional database management systems. The ODBMS framework described also allows the database model to evolve with the GNM. It is demonstrated that a proposed refinement of the GNM into subclasses results in a functional database design that can model a large variety of network resources in accord with a standardized network view.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Link quality in the common channel signaling (CCS) network is monitored and reported by the Signaling System No.7 (SS7) protocol level 2 signaling link error monitoring procedures. The procedures include two algorithms: the signal unit error rate monitor (SUERM), which provides one of the criteria for taking the link out of service, and the alignment error rate monitor (AERM), which determines whether a link should be put into service. The authors, motivated by the excessive link status changes observed in some field operations of the CCS network provide a detailed analysis of the signaling link error monitoring algorithms and show that under current SS7 specifications of the error monitoring algorithms, the probability of a link oscillating in and out of service could be high for certain sustained error rates. While the risk to the existing network may not be high due to the light loads carried at present, there is still a need to study the error monitoring issues thoroughly.<<ETX>>},

Two types of message generation process are distinguished. The message can be generated as a batch or it can be dispersed over time. The authors focus on the dispersed generation model. The main difficulty in the analysis is due to the correlation between the system states observed by different packets of the same message. A technique for analyzing the message delay in such systems for different arrival models is introduced, and it is shown that the correlation has a strong effect on the performance of the system. For an M/M/1 system with variable size messages, an explicit expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform (LST) of the message delay is obtained. It is shown that the commonly used independence assumption can lead to wrong conclusions.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A simple method is presented for estimating mean delay (sojourn time in queuing terminology) of a cell-processing processor in communication switching systems by observing the actual behavior of the systems. It is shown that Little's formula leads to the estimation of the mean delay from the number of arrivals and departures. Hence, counters for these numbers are required. The method is easy to apply to real systems because measuring times of arrivals and departures, which is difficult for a call-processing processor, is not required.

abstract={An asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch mode at which cell arrive from a diverse set of source types is considered. To improve the utilization of network resources and facilitate management and control, source types are organized into traffic classes. Cells belonging to different traffic classes are transported by separate virtual paths though the network. Approximations for the quality of service that should be maintained for each traffic class are developed. Approximations are then developed for estimating the bandwidth and buffer requirements of each traffic class and also for the switch node. The problem of assigning weights, given a set of traffic classes, is addressed. The set of traffic classes that require the least amount of resources is determined. The closely related problem of minimizing the number of traffic classes given a finite bandwidth is also discussed. The structure of the problem at hand is then exploited to develop an efficient heuristic.<<ETX>>},

A two-service-class traffic model is used in which each service class consists of bursty traffic generated by a multiple number of discrete-time Markov sources. The effect of cell loss probability on both traffic load and burstiness characteristics, as well as on system parameters such as buffer size and buffer sharing threshold, is examined. These results are useful for system design. The many examples examined yield no significant priority separation for either high- or low-priority cells.

The problem is formulated as a nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem. The objective is the maximization of the total reward for the admitted sessions where the reward for each session reflects its priority. The emphasis is on developing a real-time distributed algorithm to determine path assignments and admission controls. In computational experiments, the proposed distributed algorithm is compared with the minimum hop algorithm on test networks with up to 61 nodes and 10000 macro sessions.

If existing faults are detected, this algorithm permits the generation of a minimal set of diagnoses, each of which is formed by a set of transitions (with specific types of faults) suspected of being faulty. The occurrence in an implementation of all the faults of a given diagnosis allows the explanation of all observed implementation outputs. The algorithm guarantees the correct diagnosis of certain configurations of faults (output and/or transfer) in an implementation, which are characterized by a certain type of independence of the different faults. The authors also propose an approach for selecting additional test cases, which allows the reduction of the number of possible diagnoses. A simple example is used to demonstrate the different steps of the algorithm.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The quality of service (QoS) concept for broadband ISDN (B-ISN) is studied. The QoS parameters in the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) layer and the AAL (ATM adaptation layer) are defined. The focus is on the translation of QoS parameters between layers, particularly from the AAL to the ATM layer, because the AAL must be designed to be service dependent and specific. The QoS parameters at the ATM layer resulting from the translation will be the performance requirements on a connection basis for the ATM network. The impact of QoS parameter translation on guaranteeing QoS in the ATM network is discussed.<<ETX>>},

pages={740-747 vol.2},
abstract={An overview is given of a switching architecture for high-speed networks called Isochronets, which time-divide network bandwidth among routing trees. Traffic moves down a routing tree to the root during its time band. Network functions such as routing and flow control are entirely governed by band timers and require no processing of frame header bits. Frame motions need not be delayed for switch processing, allowing Isochronets to scale over a large spectrum of transmission speeds and support all-optical implementations. The network functions as a media-access layer that can support multiple framing protocols simultaneously, handled by higher layers at the periphery. Internetworking is reduced to a simple media-layer bridging. Isochronets provide flexible quality of service control and multicasting though allocation of bands to routing trees. They can be tuned to span a spectrum of performance behaviors outperforming both circuit and packet switching.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The integration of distributed multimedia systems around the unifying theme of quality of service (QOS) is addressed. A set of key QOS requirements is presented and mapped onto a provisional QOS architecture (QOS-A) that has emerged from a experimental system designed and implemented at Lancaster. The scope of the discussion is limited to aspects of a QOS-A for the support of continuous media communications. Also, the focus is on asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) at the network layer rather than the full range of multiservice networks. Functions and mechanisms for QOS support are examined and placed within the evolving QOS-A.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The backward compatibility dilemma introduced by the deployment of a high-speed, wide-area asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network is examined. The problem is that emerging ATM network must be capable of transporting traffic sources such as digital voice and video, but many of the design choices that optimize ATM for these sources make the transport of traditional connectionless data traffic difficult. The overlay of a virtual datagram network of connectionless servers onto a public ATM network to provide connectionless service is proposed to solve the problem. This method provides low transfer delay and efficiently utilizes network resources. Architectural issues are described, and an implementation of a connectionless server is presented.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A simulation-based analysis of the integration of VBR video and voice traffic in a cyclic-reservation multiple-access (CRMA) network is reported. The video sources are characterized via a trace of the output of a real codec. As VBR video applications can tolerate extremely low packet loss rates (<10/sup -8/), a conservative bandwidth allocation scheme that assigns high priority to the VBR sources and ensures for this class of traffic a bandwidth close to the peak rate has been chosen. Voice traffic is allocated to the low priority level in such a way as to have a complete utilization of the network capacity. The sensitivity of the quality of service (QoS) to the correlation between video sources is studied. The simulation results indicate that, for both classes of traffic, a QoS that is acceptable for service integration is obtained. However, voice traffic experiences a 99th percentile of the access delay ( approximately=80 ms) which may not be acceptable in an internetworking environment. It is shown that by managing internet voice as VBR video this problem is overcome. The dependence of the QoS parameter values on the video source characterization is analyzed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A media access control protocol, called the multiple token protocol, for high-speed ring networks is described. Its purpose is to increase the throughput under a heavy load and to decrease the access delay under a light load of the token-ring protocol. The protocol maintains several logical token rings in the single physical ring. The number of logical rings can be changed dynamically by the ring stations according to the actual ring load. Each logical ring has its own token, and its operation is close to a token ring with early-token-release and destination removal. Multiple tokens enable multiple simultaneous transmissions of new frames by different stations and decrease the waiting for a token delay.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The performance and reliability comparison of two networks that have been proposed for use as high-speed metropolitan area networks (MANs)-the Manhattan street network (MS Net) and the distributed-queue dual-bus (DQDB) network-are compared. Both networks use slotted access protocols and have the same number of links, transmitters, and receivers per node. It is shown that the MS Net provides a much higher network throughput for a variety of traffic patterns, both uniform and nonuniform. It is shown that the MS Net can survive more failures than the DQDB network and that failures cause a lesser performance degradation in the MS Net. It is also shown that higher-level mechanisms are required in the DQDB network to recover from link failures, whereas deflection routing is sufficient in the MS Net.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Using the rate control to restrict the peak cell rate of traffic is addressed. The asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) environment is considered as a discrete-time environment in which one slot is equal to one cell transmission time. A rate control that can restrict the number of cells during any fixed-length time interval in a discrete-time environment is studied. The scheme is realized by means of simple counter accumulation per slot, and it is easy to synchronize with slots. The simplicity of this scheme may make possible the flexible restriction of the peak cell rate according to network conditions. The scheme is analyzed, using matrix analytic techniques, in order to investigate the smoothing effect of bursty traffic and the queue length required to satisfy a certain quality of cell loss probability. Numerical results show the effect of restricting the peak cell rate of bursty traffic and the tradeoff between the smoothing effect and the required queue length.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The leaky bucket algorithm, which has been proposed as a monitor/enforcer in the rate-based management of bandwidth in high-performance, integrated packet communication networks, is considered. The effectiveness of the unbuffered leaky bucket algorithm in protecting the quality of service (QOS) experienced by connections passing through a common internodal link queue is studied. It is shown that excess traffic generated by a source can pass through the leaky bucket without marked or discarded and cause unacceptable packet delay/loss to other connections sharing the queue. It is also shown that average bursts that are larger, or average rate that is higher, than that assumed at connection establishment can deteriorate the queue performance even with the leaky bucket enforcing the agreed throughput QOS by discarding packets. On the basis of this analysis, a strategy for alleviating these problems is devised, namely, allocating network bandwidth above the leaky bucket permit rate and configuring the leaky bucket with a loss/mark probability greater than 10/sup -2/.<<ETX>>},

In general, it is found that the performance of SunOS 4.0.3 IPC on Sparcstation 1 over the Ethernet is very good. An experiment has shown that average throughput rates of up to 7.5 Mb/s are achievable. Further investigation has shown that this rate is not limited by the TCP/IP performance, but by the driver performance. Therefore, a better driver implementation will increase throughput further. Some improvements to the default IPC are still possible. The performance of IPC for local processes is estimated to be about 43% of the memory bandwidth. The interaction of computation and communication is significant. An experiment has shown that the additional load on the machine greatly decreases throughput.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An exact analysis of the dynamic behavior of IGRP, an adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm, is performed. The distance metric is a weighted sum of traffic-sensitive and traffic-insensitive delay components. The optimality and stability of the protocol is related to the ratio of the weights. In particular, it is shown that if the traffic-sensitive component is not given enough weight, then starting from any initial routing, the subsequent routings after finitely many update periods will oscillate between two worst cases. Otherwise, the successive routings will converge to the unique equilibrium routing. It is also shown that load sharing among routes whose distances are within a threshold of the minimum distance helps stabilize the dynamic behavior.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The combined fragmentation-and-routing problem is addressed. Several possible fragmentation machines are discussed, and their equivalence is indicated. This allows the formulation of a comprehensive yet tractable flow model, whose performance measure is total delay. An analysis of this model leads to necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the fragmentation-and-routing problem. The optimality conditions serve as a baseline for devising several optimal algorithms, both centralized and distributed. In order to deal with minimum first derivative length algorithms, the concept of minimum first derivative paths is generalized in order to accommodate them in the environment used. Several special cases of practical interest are discussed. It is shown the problem size and the running time of the algorithms are considerably shortened in networks in which packet sizes come in a limited number of sizes. The approach can accommodate performance measures other than total delay.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A routing control method called potential routing is proposed for packet communication in computer networks. Potential routing models a computer network as an electrical circuit, and performs packet routing according to the potential differences between adjacent nodes. The node potentials are first given by Kirchhoff's law and are then dynamically adjusted according to the traffic situation. Potential routing can be applied to arbitrary network topologies; it takes account of the global network topology in determining the route. The routing table is easily and therefore quickly computed by Kirchhoff's law, by solving simple simultaneous equations; no convergence problem arises. Moreover, potential routing does not involve the ping-pong (loop) problem. It is verified by simulation that potential routing shortens transmission delays, especially when the traffic is heavy or unbalanced.<<ETX>>},

A routing algorithm is developed to converse wavelength converters while maintaining performance close to that of a network with abundant converters. It is found that converters can improve the network performance, such as the blocking probability and fairness, considerably.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Passive, single-hop interconnections among N stations, each with several transmitters and receivers, provide a communication path between any two stations using one of the transmitters and receivers of each station.

It is shown how to optimally compose the layouts of any two-fiber-optic single-hop interconnections to form that of the product interconnection.

abstract={The unique capabilities of lightwave technology are exploited in order to construct optimized regular multihop networks when the traffic flow among the network nodes is asymmetric. The specific problem addressed is as follows: given that the network nodes must be connected in a regular interconnection pattern and that the node positions in the regular network can be adjusted by properly tuning their (optical) transceivers, what is the best node placement in a given regular topology? In particular, the ShuffleNet-based regular topology is examined. ShuffleNet has the property of producing large connected graphs with small degree and diameter. In order words, it can interconnect a large number of nodes with a small number of transceivers per node such that information from a source can reach its destination in a small number of hops. Since finding the optimal node placement is a computationally hard problem, efficient heuristic algorithms are formulated to design optimized ShuffleNet structures for a given traffic matrix.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The problem of finding the worst-case end-to-end delay and buffer occupancy bounds in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks with rate-controlled, non-work-conserving servers is addressed. A theoretical framework is constructed to analyze such servers in isolation and in tandem. The analysis is based on a simple fluid model, but care is taken so that the computed delay and buffer occupancy values are upper bounds on actual values. A single algorithm is presented to perform these calculations in linear time. Simulation results are given in order to compare the computed worst-case delays with the actual delays obtained on some simple network topologies. The algorithm is found to predict node delays well for bursty input traffic, but poorly for smooth input traffic. Buffer requirements are predicted well in both cases.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A way to calculate the performance of packet switching communication networks under a fixed (session-based) routing strategy, based on properly bounding the probability distribution functions of the system input processes, is proposed. The bounds suggested, which are decaying exponentials, posses three convenient properties. When the inputs to an isolated network element are all bounded, they result in bounded outputs and ensure that the delays and queues in this element have exponentially decaying distribution. In some network settings, the bounded inputs result in bounded outputs. Finally, natural traffic processes can be shown to satisfy such bounds. These properties enable the calculation of upper bounds for all the interesting parameters of network performance, in a variety of settings.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Worst-case bounds on delay and backlog are derived for leaky bucket constrained sessions in arbitrary topology networks of generalized processor sharing servers. When only a subset of the sessions are leaky bucket constrained succinct per-session bounds that are independent of the behavior of the other sessions and also of the network topology are given. However, these bounds are only shown to hold for each session that is guaranteed a backlog clearing rate that exceeds the token arrival rate of its leaky bucket. When all of the sessions are leaky bucket constrained, a much larger class of networks called consistent relative session treatment networks is analyzed. The session i route is treated as a whole, yielding tighter bounds than those that result from adding the worst-case delays (backlogs) at each of the servers in the route. The bounds on delay and backlog for each session are computed and shown to be achieved by staggered regimes when an independent sessions relaxation holds. Propagation delay is also incorporated into the model.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A buffer insertion ring with network access fairness control for gigabit LANs is proposed. The basic buffer insertion ring has the maximum spatial reuse on the multiple ring segments by allowing concurrent traffic, but it suffers from the possibility of station starvation. To solve this problem, a notion of adjustable fairness based on mutual interference between pairs of stations in bandwidth usage is defined. The adjustable fairness definition serves as a basis for conditions to trigger backpressure signals. A cooperative backpressure mechanism is invented for flow regulation. The effectiveness of the proposed network access mechanism is demonstrated by comparisons with other buffer insertion rings based on simulations.<<ETX>>},

These results hold for a variety of conflict resolution policies (CRPs).

abstract={An asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch architecture, the multinet switch, is presented. It is a self-routing multistage switch with internal buffers capable of achieving 100% throughput. Although it provides incoming ATM cells with multiple paths, the cell sequence is maintained throughout the switch fabric, thus eliminating the out-of-order cell sequence problem. Cells contending for the same output addresses are buffered internally according to a partial buffer sharing discipline. In a partial buffer sharing scheme, buffers are partially to accommodate bursty traffic and to limit the performance degradation that may happen in a completely shared system where a small number of calls ties up the entire buffer space unfairly. Although the hardware complexity is similar to that of the input queueing switches, the multinet switch has throughput and delay performance similar to that of output queueing switches without the hardware complexity. A simple extension of the multinet switch to handle multiple priority traffic and multicast traffic is proposed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A practical approach to the analysis and operation of medium to large-size distributed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches based on an original optical reconfigurable architecture is described. The optical nature of the switch provides enormous bandwidth with input/output port rates on the order of gigabits/second, and the distributed approach is highly modular, creating an easily growable switch. The interconnection pattern between input and output ports is dynamically reconfigurable; the switch can thus exploit nonuniformities in the offered traffic and optimize its connectivity accordingly. For a 24*24 switch, this leads to performance that matches that of a fully connected output buffered ideal centralized switch. Simulation results for a switch of size 81*81 seem to indicate that the traffic-handling capability scales well with the size of the switch when nonuniformity prevails in the offered traffic, a realistic assumption. Clustering techniques would permit the optimization and operation of much larger reconfigurable distributed ATM switches.<<ETX>>},

The two chains are solved together iteratively to yield an approximation to the original N-dimensional infinite chain.

abstract={A general theory of on-off sources is provided. The basic source model is characterized by alternating independent on (burst) and off (silence) periods, which may have general distributions. Other more complex sources are constructed, and their behavior is characterized in terms of the basic source model. Heterogeneous and homogeneous statistical multiplexers fed by such sources are considered. In the heterogeneous environment, a simple result on the tail behavior of the multiplexer queue length distribution in the heavy traffic is provided. In the homogeneous environment, asymptotic results on the tail behavior of the queue length distribution are provided for all levels of utilization. The results for the heterogeneous environment suggest a new call admission control policy for general on-off sources in high-speed networks, which depends only on the first two moments of the on and off periods of individual sources and their respective peak rates.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The cell loss suffered by a data stream in an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network is studied using its loss function L( mu , beta ). This is the number of cells lost if the stream were allocated a transmission bandwidth of mu cells per second and a buffer of beta cells. Properties of the loss function are derived. Two popular allocation schemes are studied: the fixed-rate-fixed-buffer scheme and the leaky bucket scheme. An example suggests how the loss function might be used to relate pricing of bandwidth and buffer resources to the resulting cell loss.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An input rate flow control mechanism, the burst level feedback scheme, is introduced and studied. Burst level information is used to gain performance improvement. An analytical methodology, based on queuing models, is presented for the analysis and performance evaluation of this scheme. Performance results are shown to illustrate the features of the analytical technique and to demonstrate the performance improvement obtained by the scheme. This input rate control method is shown to be effective for traffic regulation at the access to an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network loaded by highly bursty stations. The analytical tools developed allow the system designer to evaluate the proper level of input regulation that should be used to guarantee acceptable queue-size and delay levels at the source station's buffer and at the buffer of the shared network switch.<<ETX>>},

year={1993},
volume={},
number={},
pages={376-383 vol.1},
abstract={In currently proposed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) congestion control schemes, the policing function is carried out at the network edge, which opens the possibility of cells being discarded or marked without reference to the actual message. This can lead to degradation of the service quality in the voice service or multiplication of the cell loss probability in the data service. The authors propose an approach to the policing function, called user-network policer, to resolve these problems. The scheme consists of a service-dependent user policer and a service-independent network policer. Users are responsible for policing and marking their traffic appropriately before sending them into the network. The network is only responsible for verifying the correctness of user policing and for transporting cells transparently across the network.<<ETX>>},

pages={358-367 vol.1},
abstract={The leaky bucket, a credit management system that allows cells to enter the network only if sufficient credit is available, is considered. Motivation for an in-depth study of dynamic control algorithms, to avoid congestion in high-speed networks under time varying traffic statistics, is provided. The need for real-time traffic measurements and dynamic control actions for long-lived connections is demonstrated. In particular, it is shown through simulations that implementing access control algorithms based on the bandwidth allocation procedures only at connection setup is not sufficient for congestion-free operation of the network. It is further shown that if the bandwidth allocation and the leaky bucket parameters are not dynamically adjusted, the performances of the connections depend on their initial parameters and can be very undesirable as the traffic parameters change over time. Moreover, if corrective actions are not taken, congestion may build up in the network even in the presence of leaky buckets. The simple dynamic approach proposed limits the congestion periods in the network to the time scales of the connection-level controls. Therefore, the probability of many connections sending excess traffic into the network at the same time is greatly reduced, alleviating the congestion problem.<<ETX>>},

pages={347-357 vol.1},
abstract={Dispersity routing is defined. It is combined with random access and fast circuit set-up and tear-down to put bursty data on an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network. This approach makes the storage in the network independent of the message length. This approach is evaluated assuming that the propagation delay may be more than the message transmission time. It is shown that the efficiency improves as the number of channels on each path increases, and that dispersity routing makes it reasonable to use the strategy on networks with a small number of channels per path. Dispersity routing requires networks with multiple paths between many of the nodes. This characteristic is also required for many adaptive routing strategies. A class of networks is proposed in which the fraction of nodes with multiple paths, and the number of multiple paths between nodes, can be controlled. These networks provide a platform for evaluating multiple path strategies.<<ETX>>},

year={1993},
volume={},
number={},
pages={338-346 vol.1},
abstract={The authors consider the problem of finding a routing strategy that minimizes the worst-case expected delay from every source to a single destination in an unreliable network, given a constraint on the number of outgoing links at each node that can be inoperational at any point in time. Subject to this constraint, links can fail and recover arbitrarily often. A node having a packet to forward must choose a single link on which to transmit the packet, but does not know in advance which links will be inoperational during the transmission. If a transmission fails, the packet is retransmitted (not necessarily on the same link) after some fixed amount of time. It is shown that the optimal routing strategy is a stationary randomized strategy in which each node selects the forwarding link according to a fixed probability distribution. An efficient algorithm that computes an epsilon -optimal solution in O( mod E mod log( mod V mod / epsilon )) time, for any positive number epsilon , is presented.<<ETX>>},

pages={330-337 vol.1},
abstract={The authors examine the structural relationship between load and blocking probability for a fully connected homogeneous nonhierarchical network when blocked messages cause retrial and when different alternate routing strategies are employed to overcome congestion. The model employed for analysis is based on the flow approximation. It is found that retrials push the stable equilibrium state away from the zero blocking state, thereby aggravating congestion. The alternate routing strategies accommodate the stable equilibrium state close to the zero blocking state. However, both the retrials and the alternate routing strategies do not alter the fundamental structure of the system, namely, the fold catastrophe. By solving the degenerate equation, the value of appropriate control parameters can be obtained. According to the present model, it is only under schemes with no alternate routing that the system attains stability, in the mathematical sense of the term.<<ETX>>},

volume={},

pages={322-329 vol.1},
abstract={Multipath source routing schemes can be distinguished by their choice of allocation granularity. The schemes proposed in the literature advocate a per-connection allocation wherein all the packets of a connection are constrained to follow the same path. The authors believe that a smaller allocation granularity permits a finer control to be exerted and would result in improved performance, especially in the presence of bursty traffic sources. A simple two-node network is used to compare the performance of both allocation schemes. An analytical model is developed to compute the resequencing delay distribution for the per-packet allocation. It is observed that as the burstiness of the arrival process increases, the per-packet allocation is able to accommodate bursts in a more graceful fashion, resulting in better performance. The per-packet allocation also permits a more equitable distribution of network resources than the per-connection.<<ETX>>},

pages={312-321 vol.1},
abstract={The irregular torus, a class of topologies proposed for metropolitan area networks, is torus-like, and thus more reliable than the bus and ring topologies. There is a routing algorithm for the topologies which is space and time efficient so that it is suitable for high-speed implementations. In addition, it is robust to topology perturbations due to network growth and node/link failure. A buffer management is proposed to prevent store-and-forward deadlock for routing in the irregular torus, and the throughput of a typical irregular torus network is analyzed. Store-and-forward deadlock is avoided by a buffer management whose storage requirement and control complexity at a node are both constant with the size of a network. The throughput of a typical irregular torus network is shown to be within a constant factor of that of a square torus. Hence for a large number of nodes, it is much higher than the throughput of a bus, ring or tree.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A prime instrument for controlling congestion in high-speed broadband ISDN (BISDN) networks is admission control, which limits call and guarantees a grade of service determined by delay and loss probability in the multiplexer. It is shown, for general Markovian traffic sources, that it is possible to assign a notational effective bandwidth to each source which is an explicitly identified, simply computing quantity with provably correct properties in the natural asymptotic regime of small loss probabilities. It is the maximal real eigenvalue of a matrix which is directly obtained from the source characteristics and the admission criterion, and for several sources it is simply additive. Both fluid and point process models are considered, and parallel results are obtained.

abstract={Admission-control schemes for voice traffic in circuit-switched multihop radio networks are studied. The problem formulation is based on the methodology of multiple-service, multiple-resource (MSMR) modeling, and only those admission-control policies that yield a coordinate convex state space are considered. This restriction, in conjunction with reasonable modeling assumptions, results in a product-form stationary distribution for the system state. A recursive procedure to accelerate the evaluation of a large number of different admission-control policies and a descent-search method to minimize the number of policies that must be evaluated in searching for the optimal one are developed. Numerical examples indicate that performance can be improved by administering admission control, but the improvement is typically small unless different revenues or costs are associated with the various call types.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A family of queuing systems in which the interarrival time I/sub n+1/ between customers n and n+1 depends on the service time B/sub n/ of customer n is considered. Specifically, cases where the dependency between I/sub n+1/ and B/sub n/ is a proportionally relation and B/sub n/ is an exponentially distributed random variable is considered. Such dependencies arise in the context of packet-switched networks from employing rate policing functions which regulate the amount of data that can arrive at a link within any given time interval. The models developed and the associated solutions are, however, of independent interest and potentially applicable to other environments. Several scenarios that consist of adding an independent random variable to the interarrival time, allowing the proportionality to be random, and the combination of the two are considered. Numerical results are compared to those for an equivalent system without dependencies.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The no-slot-wasting bandwidth balancing (NSW BWB) recently proposed for dual-bus architectures provides throughput fairness and arbitrary bandwidth distribution without wasting channel slots. The performance of two variations of NSW BWB in the presence of erasure nodes and under one or multiple priority classes of traffic is studied by simulation. For both variations, the effect of the erasure mode locations on the throughputs of the various stations, as well as priority classes of traffic, is examined, and the performance of NSW BWB is compared with the corresponding performance of the bandwidth-balancing mechanism of the distributed queue dual bus. The simulation results reveal some very interesting properties for the first of the two NSW BWB variations that are used to derive analytic estimates of its throughput performance in the general case of arbitrary number of stations and arbitrary location of erasure nodes.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A random packet selection policy for multicast switching is studied. An input packet generates a fixed number of primary copies plus a random number of secondary copies. Assuming a constant number of contending packets during a slot, the system is modeled as a discrete-time birth process. A difference equation describing the dynamics of this process is derived, the solution of which gives the distribution of the number of packets chosen. This result is extended to the steady-state distribution through an embedded Markov chain analysis. It is shown that the old packets have a larger number of copies than the fresh packets, and the copy distribution is derived. The packet and copy throughputs taking into account the old packets have been determined. The asymptotic distribution of the number of packets chosen is obtained for large switch sizes under saturation by applying results from renewal theory.<<ETX>>},

The authors examine the performance of four network data representation standards: ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules (BER) and Packed Encoding Rules (PER), Sun Microsystems' External Data Representation (XDR), and Apollo Computer's Network Data Representation (NDR). It is found that the areas crucial to efficient encoder and decoder implementations are memory management, buffer management, and the overall simplicity of the encoding rules.

abstract={The authors examine the data transfer phase of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to identify complex processing elements, where complexity is measured in terms of instruction counts. The objective is to reduce the complexity and improve the performance of TCP in a high speed networking environment, especially for bulk data transfer. It is found that most of the complexity is due to incomplete state information exchange with the peer, and to adapting to network dynamics using the current congestion control scheme. By partitioning of the protocol functionality into data and control information processing, along with the use of a rate based congestion control scheme, the complexity can be reduced by up to 67%. Performance can be further enhanced by running the new properly partitioned TCP in parallel as well as by simplifying the logic associated with some TCP timers.<<ETX>>},

The minimum size of buffers required at the transmitter and the receiver to provide the connection is determined. The minimum source to sink delay achievable for different buffer initialization strategies and the corresponding buffer prefills are derived.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The end-to-end cell discarding behavior of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) telecommunication networks is considered. Cell discarding is performed in priority fashion by a nested threshold mechanism. Extensions to a previous single-queue analysis that allow the calculations of end-to-end discarding probabilities for each priority are presented. A computer tool based on this analysis, called DANTE (for discarding analysis in a network telecommunications environment) is described. It facilitates the calculation of end-to-end discarding probabilities for very general network topologies. This tool is used to generate sample results, illustrating important issues in designing networks to meet cell loss objectives. The computational efficiency of the computer-aided analytical tool is compared with that of simulation techniques. The presence of bursty traffic (not modeled here) is likely to change the cell discarding results quantitatively, but not the design issues identified herein.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A system which uses multiple asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) virtual circuits operating in parallel in order to control two WAN hosts at gigabit speeds is studied. Packets in parallel channels can bypass each other, so reordering of packets before delivery to the host is required. Performance parameters of this system, including ATM channel delay, packet loss, and resequencing delay, are analyzed, using a model for an ATM channel that multiplexes ATM virtual circuits carrying bursty and nonbursty traffic. It is found that the mean and variance of packet delay through an ATM switch grow linearly with burst size, and that the delay distribution can be closely approximated by a normal distribution. It is shown that packet loss is log-linear in the ratio of buffer size to burst size, and for maximum bursts larger than 50 cells, a buffer size of twice the maximum burst size is sufficient to achieve packet loss probabilities less than 10/sup -9/. Resequencing delay is shown to be insensitive to burst size, but the variance is large and grows linearly with burst size.<<ETX>>},

Mobile users transmit update messages only upon entering cells of reporting centers, while every search for a mobile user is restricted to the vicinity of the reporting center to which the user last reported.

abstract={The performance of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching node is analyzed, taking cell arrival correlation into consideration. An ATM switching node is modeled as a discrete-time finite-buffer queue. Cell arrivals are assumed to follow a semi Markovian process. Various characteristics of the cell loss and the distribution function of the cell output process from an ATM switching node are analyzed. The cell loss probability, the consecutive loss probability, the distribution of loss period lengths, the joint distribution of successive cell interdeparture times, and the distributions of busy and idle periods are determined. It is shown that both the correlation and the variation of cell arrivals significantly affect the cell loss and the output process characteristics.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors consider a three-stage switching configuration with no internal buffers, i.e., bufferless switches are used at the first and second stages, and output buffered switches at the third stage. Short-term cell loss probability is analyzed in order to examine the influence of bursty traffic on the performance of the bufferless switches used at the first two stages. A four-stage switching configuration with traffic distributors added at the first stage is proposed. This switch provides more paths between a pair of input and output ports than the three-stage configuration. Some schemes for distributing cells are compared. It is shown that the distributor successfully reduces cell loss probability due to bursty traffic by splitting incoming cells into several switching modules.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The load splitting link selection algorithm used in the Common Channel Signaling (CCS) network and proposed for use in the interswitching system interface in the network supporting the Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) is considered. The algorithm uses a randomly generated bit pattern to select a link for transmission. The author discusses how the traffic loads are distributed among the links in a link set based on the load splitting link selection algorithm and shows that, in some cases, the overall traffic capacity of the link set does not increase even when the number of installed links increases. A theorem that shows how to construct the set of links to increase the line set capacity is demonstrated. The theorem is used as the basis for an efficient and flexible procedure for implementing the link dimensioning algorithm in software, to support the mechanization of the CCS and SMDS network planning and traffic engineering functions.<<ETX>>},

pages={1288-1297 vol.3},
abstract={Dynamic bandwidth allocation among traffic classes with different performance requirements sharing an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) link is considered as an integrated control problem with a multilevel structure. At the lower level, call admission control rules are applied that maintain a certain grade of service, in terms of cell loss probability and cell delay, given the buffer space and bandwidth assigned to each class; unlike those used in previous works, these rules are derived on the basis of homogeneous (based on similar quantities) measures of the performance requirements. At the higher level, bandwidth shares are periodically recomputed online by an allocation controller, whose goals reflect overall cell loss and refused traffic, as well as overall average delay. These goals are expressed by an optimization problem that is solved by numerical techniques. The whole control system should provide a dynamic feedback controller, capable of reacting in real time to changes in the traffic patterns. Simulation results are presented and are discussed in regard to the efficiency of the admission controllers, the performance of the overall scheme, and the capability of reacting to sudden changes in the load of some traffic class.<<ETX>>},

pages={1306-1313 vol.3},
abstract={The authors consider the static load balancing problem of assigning several large tasks to a (smaller) system of homogeneous processors, where a task's structure is modeled as a branching process, and all tasks are assumed to have stochastically identical behavior. They show how the theory of majorization can be used to obtain a partial order among possible task assignment. The power of this approach may be summarized as follows: a simple comparison between assignments creates an ordering between them that holds for a variety of objective functions as well as for several statistics such as the mean and variance. This partial ordering is particularly useful when heterogeneous constraints are placed on the numbers of tasks that one may assign to the processors. The results show that if the vector of numbers of tasks assigned to each processor under one mapping is majorized by that of another mapping, then the former mapping is better than the latter with respect to a large number of objective functions. In particular, it is shown how measurements of finishing time, resource utilization, and reliability are all captured by the theory.<<ETX>>},

volume={},

pages={1314-1319 vol.3},
abstract={The performance of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) multiplexer is evaluated, with the aggregate arrivals modeled as a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP). The analysis is based on two simplifying assumptions: the probability that the MMPP goes through multiple state transitions between two successive departures is negligible, and state transitions occur at departure points. The transition probability matrix that describes the number of cells in the buffer after a departure can then be partitioned into submatrices, each of which is analogous to that of an M/D/1/K queue. These assumptions are reasonable for ATM traffic models in which the arrival rates are large and cell size is small. The accuracy of the analysis is evaluated, using a four-state MMPP model to represent the aggregate arrival process. The departure point and arrival point queue-length distributions, cell loss probabilities and average queuing delays are obtained analytically and compared to simulation results.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The conditions under which nodal decomposition can be applied for networkwide, multimedia traffic analysis are determined. Through extensive simulation studies of individual departure source characteristics and intersource cross-correlation at the output side of a network node, the nodal decomposition approach is validated for large-scale high-speed, integrated networks. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic environments in which individual sources are modeled as various two-state/multiple-state Markov-modulated processes are considered. By applying the validated nodal decomposition approach, the problem of analyzing the performance of a multimedia network as a whole becomes tractable. Each ATM node is modeled by a queue with infinite buffers and a deterministic server.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The multiplexing of shaped on-off sources on an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) link is addressed. In particular, an N-level shaper is analyzed. It modulates the source output bit rate on the basis of the buffer occupancy level. A very accurate analytical model describing its behavior is provided. Such a model allows an accurate description of the shaper output flow characteristics. A simple analytical model is also proposed for an ATM multiplexer in order to evaluate the advantages arising from the source shaping. The accuracy of the analytical results comes out from the comparison with the simulation ones. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed shaping mechanism. They demonstrate that a substantial increase of the number of multiplexable sources is possible, for a given value of cell loss probability.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Single-hop lightwave networks with stations interconnected using wavelength-division multiplexing are considered. The stations are equipped with tunable transmitters and/or receivers. Coordination between the transmitting and receiving stations is achieved by assuming synchronous control and a predefined, frequency-time oriented schedule which specifies the slots and the wavelengths on which communication between any two pairs of stations is allowed to take place. The authors define and analyze, in terms of throughput, all possible types of schedules in the situation where the number of available wavelengths is equal to the number of stations. The results are valid for the general case, i.e., nonuniform traffic. The optimization of schedules, given the traffic requirements, is considered, and optimization heuristics that give near-optimal results are presented.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Dynamic routing algorithms are proposed for setting up multicast connections in a linear lightwave network (LLN). The problem of finding a physical path for the multicast connection so as to satisfy all the constraints in the LLN is shown to be NP-complete, and a heuristic approach is presented. An algorithm is presented that decomposes the LLN into edge disjoint trees with at least one spanning tree. A multicast call is allocated a physical path on one of the trees, using the smallest component tree (SCT) or the minimum interference tree (MIT) criterion. Finally, the call is allocated the least used channel from among channels that can be allocated to it. The best performance (low blocking probability) is obtained when the LLN is decomposed into many spanning trees, each of them having a small diameter. It is also found that the selection of trees for each call using the MIT criterion exhibits better performance than with the SCT criterion.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A multilevel priority scheme for fiber-optic CDMA is proposed. Users are divided into groups with different transmission power levels. Since the inherent properties and signal processing of the conventional communication channels are different from those of the fiber-optic channels, new code sequences must be constructed for fiber-optic applications. Furthermore, fiber-optic systems can be modeled as positive systems. Therefore, the packets from higher power groups can transmit successfully with higher probability than those from lower power groups. This implies that packets with higher power levels have higher priority than those packets with lower power levels. The goal of this research is to analyze the performance of fiber-optic CDMA packet networks using code sequences with given orthogonality properties.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Most fault resolution systems for communications networks represent fault resolution expertise using a rule-based reasoning (RBR) paradigm. Although the RBR paradigm is appropriate for problem-solving tasks that are confined and well-understood, its limitations are an inability to learn from experience, an inability to deal with novel problems, and the difficulty of updating the systems to keep up with rapidly changing domains such as expanding heterogeneous networks. A case-based reasoning (CBR) application that is less constrained by these limitations is described. The approach taken is to enhance a standard fault management system with a CBR component, CBR techniques for retrieving, adapting, and embedding knowledge in a case library are reviewed, and CRITTER, a CBR trouble ticketing system for managing and resolving network faults, is described.<<ETX>>},
