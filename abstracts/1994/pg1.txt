abstract={This paper proposes scalable conflict-free media-access protocols with a novel architecture called parallel queueing for WDM optical passive star networks. The processing and hardware resource requirements are low and the control signalling demand is significantly reduced by using a small number of parallel queues in each station. A new scheme called wormhole scheduling is introduced to compensate the relatively slow laser-filter tuning speed. The protocol using wormhole scheduling decreases the overhead of tuning (thus increases the throughput) and relieves the electronic processing bottleneck. The key ideas are: (1) to associate several parallel queues with a data channel, rather that one deep queue (as in DT-WDMA) of N static queues, N is the number of stations; and (2) to schedule multiple successive packets which are destined to the same receiver at one time. An analytical model is presented and verified through simulation. Numerical results from analysis and simulation indicate that with only 5-6 parallel queues, the protocols are capable of achieving high throughput. Thus the protocols can be scaled up for networks with a large number of stations and could lead to potential implementation.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The characteristics of service independence and flexibility of ATM networks make the control problems of them very critical. One of the most fundamental is source policing. The most critical situation regards the control of bursty sources. Especially for this kind of traffic the estimation of the characteristics of the source is difficult. The known policing mechanisms cannot control effectively the negotiated traffic parameters. The authors enhance the "traditional" leaky bucket (LB) using a stochastic estimator learning algorithm (SELA) in order to "learn" the behaviour of the source and, if necessary, to react. This generalized mechanism improves dramatically the performance of LB and can be used for any bursty source. It achieves tighter and faster control and exhibits no computation overhead. The above features are investigated via simulation, and the extracted results demonstrate the effectiveness of this control.<<ETX>>},

pages={1536-1543 vol.3},
abstract={The authors propose a media access protocol for an optical star-coupler network in which the stations are equipped with fixed transmitters and tunable receivers and use wavelength-division multiplexing. The protocol, called the group TDM scheme (GTDM), is a reservation-based scheme in which the nodes are assembled into groups. The nodes within a group communicate with the nodes of other groups using the TDM scheme, but they make reservations using the dynamic allocation scheme (DAS), which has been proposed earlier. GTDM tries to overcome the drawbacks of TDM (unnecessary high delays under low load) and DAS (high signaling costs) by providing a trade-off between packet delay and signaling costs. Analytical and simulation results show that GTDM can achieve good performance with low signaling complexity. It is also shown to perform better than hybrid TDM (HTDM), a hybrid of TDM and DAS, for a given signaling complexity.<<ETX>>},

pages={1528-1535 vol.3},
abstract={The authors propose MaTPi, a new media-access protocol for the efficient utilization of resources in a local-area optical WDMA network. Most of the earlier work on reservation based media access protocols for single-hop optical networks has assumed the availability of state-of-the-art transmitters and/or receivers which are capable of tuning to the required wavelengths within nanoseconds. Their protocol operates in the region where the tuning times of the end-devices are of the same order of magnitude as the transmission time of a packet. In the basic MaTPi protocol, network throughput is improved by effectively overlapping the tuning duration of a transmitter in a node with the transmitting times of lasers in other nodes. They extend this basic protocol to the mult-MaTPi protocol, where each node has more than one transmitter to further improve the bandwidth efficiency of the network. Preliminary simulation results indicate that this practical protocol is indeed capable of achieving high throughput with low-cost, off-the-shelf components. A number of extensions to this protocol are also discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The virtual path (VP) concept has been proposed to simplify traffic control and resource management in future B-ISDN. In particular, call setup processing can be significantly reduced when resources are reserved on VPs. However, this advantage is offset by a decrease in statistical multiplexing gains of the networks. The focus of this paper is on how to improve bandwidth efficiency through adaptive routing when capacity is reserved on all VPs. The authors first examine two VP capacity reservation strategies. They then design and evaluate computationally feasible Markov decision process-based routing algorithms and show that the network blocking probability can be significantly reduced by MDP routing.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Telecommunication fiber networks can be more complicated than the traditional graph-theoretic networks of nodes and links. This is due to practical and economic considerations. The paper considers two major types of deviations from the traditional graph-theoretic network, and provide an algorithm for the shortest pair of physically-disjoint paths between a given pair of nodes in the network. Such disjoint paths can be used for improving the reliability of the network, e.g., one path may be used as a back up while the other is actually used for transmission of data. Alternatively, the entire traffic between the given pair of nodes in the network may be divided equally over the two disjoint paths so that if a node or link on one of the paths fails, not all of the traffic is lost. Optimizing the length of disjoint paths helps in reducing the amount of fiber usage and network costs.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Traditional communication networks reroute connections following link or node failures. This can be regarded as forced rerouting. The next generation ATM networks are supposed to be more intelligent and to offer more services than existing networks. An intelligent network may sometimes decide to reroute a connection whose virtual channel is still alive. This can be regarded as intentional rerouting. The present paper deals with intentional rerouting of ATM connections. It shows that intentional rerouting can ensure cell FIFO and integrity. Then several possible applications of intentional rerouting are suggested and discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The problem of dynamic routing in multiple-service networks is studied. The authors consider a multirate circuit-switched broadband ISDN network that supports a variety of traffic classes with different traffic characteristics (bandwidth requirement, call arrival rate, and call holding time) and reward parameter. The task is to find a dynamic routing method which minimizes the long-run average cost of lost calls. Markov decision theory, with the objective of an average cost optimization is appropriate to the solution of this problem. Using this approach, they propose a distributed, state dependent, dynamic routing method which they call least cost routing in multiple-service networks (LCRM). They define a base policy such that the corresponding relative cost function associated with the Howard (1960) policy improvement routine of Markov decision theory is easily computed. This function is then used to determine the one-step policy improvement (LCRM).<<ETX>>},

abstract={Chao and Choe (1993) proposed a recursive modular architecture for implementing a large-scale multicast output buffered ATM switch (MOBAS). Four major functions of designing a multicast switch: cell replication, cell routing, cell contention resolution, and cell addressing, are all performed distributedly in the MOBAS, which allows the switch to grow. The architecture of the MOBAS has a regular and uniform structure and, thus, has the advantages of: (1) easy expansion due to the modular structure, (2) high integration density for VLSI implementation, (3) relaxed synchronization for data and clock signals, and (4) building the center switch fabric with a single type of chip. Multicast knockout principle, an extension of generalized knockout principle, is applied to construct the entire switch fabric so as to reduce the hardware complexity (e.g., the number of switch elements and interconnection wires) by almost one order of magnitude. In the present paper, the authors analyze a two-stage MOBAS in its cell loss rate and present some numerical results. They show that a switch that is designed, based on the multicast knockout principle, to meet the performance requirement for unicast calls will also satisfy the performance requirement for multicast calls.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The maximum throughput of a single-stage non-blocking input-queued switch such as the sort-banyan network is shown to be 0.586 under the uniform traffic model. It can be increased to 0.88 or 0.97 respectively if the switch is speeded up by a factor of 2 or 3. Hui and Lee (1992) showed that, for a large scale three-stage switch built with sort-banyan switch modules, the maximum throughput reduces to 0.458. The analysis was performed based on the assumption that the number of middle-stage switch modules is equal to the number of input/output links of a switch module. In the paper, the authors study the effect of increasing the number of middle-stage switch modules and speeding up the switch. Numerical results are obtained and verified by computer simulations for various combinations. For example, with a speedup factor of 2, the maximum throughput can be improved to 0.85 if the number of middle-stage switch modules is doubled.<<ETX>>},

It is difficult to achieve fault tolerance in binary self-routing networks without adding additional switching planes, stages, or switching elements in order to have multiple paths due to their characteristics of a unique routing path between any input and output pair. However, since the MOBAS intrinsically has multiple paths between any input and output, it is inherently robust for faults without need to add any additional switching elements. The fault-tolerance of the MOBAS is shown through the performance analysis of the MOBAS under various fault conditions.<<ETX>>},

The objective of the paper is to develop models to evaluate the throughput and packet delay, in the presence of a general traffic pattern, of an ATM switching fabric using multiple buffers at the outputs of the switching elements. The models are based on Markov chains, and use several simplifying assumptions to make the model tractable. One of the models take into account of the blocked packets and the history of blocking.

abstract={Quality of service and network controllability are issues that have yet to be clearly defined for broadband packet switching networks. One method of influencing the quality of service and the controllability of packet switched networks is queue scheduling. Unfortunately, defining an optimal queue scheduling method is highly dependent upon the cost function chosen for a particular switch implementation. Therefore, the authors propose a VLSI generic queue scheduler that can emulate a wide variety of queue scheduling methods. They implement the VLSI generic queue scheduler using a VLSI system synthesis tool, OASIS, and through measurements explore the size and speed of various system configurations. The process of employing some scheduling methods in this architecture is also detailed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={It is well known that a multistage banyan network, which is a single-path blocking structure, becomes rearrangeable non-blocking in a circuit switching environment if the number of its stages is increased so as to obtain a Benes network. Banyan networks, provided with a shared queue in each switching element, have often been proposed as the core of an interconnection network for an ATM packet switching environment. In this scenario, if the classical interstage back-pressure protocols are used, adding stages to a banyan network can even degrade the banyan network performance, in spite of the multipath capability given by the additional stages. A class of new simple interstage protocols is defined to operate in the added stages of the banyan network so that a sort of sharing of the queueing capability in each added stage is accomplished. Large improvements in the traffic performance of these extended banyan networks are obtained, especially in the region of offered loads providing a low packet loss probability.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Studies a multistage hierarchical ATM switch in which each switching component has its own local cell buffer memory that is shared among all its output ports. The authors propose a novel buffer management technique called "delayed pushout" that combines a pushout mechanism, for sharing memory efficiently among queues within the same switching component, and a backpressure mechanism, for sharing memory across switch stages. The backpressure component has a threshold to restrict the amount of sharing between stages. A synergy emerges when pushout, backpressure, and this threshold are all employed together. Using a computer simulation of the switch under bursty traffic, the authors study delayed pushout as well as several simpler pushout and backpressure schemes under a wide range of loads. At every load level, they find that the delayed pushout scheme has a lower cell loss rate than its competitors. Finally, they show how delayed pushout can be extended to share buffer space between traffic classes with different space priorities.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors have developed a system enabling high-speed encrypted file transfer, while conducting secret voice communication using ISDN. The system will simultaneously encrypt and decrypt a one megabyte plain text file on a hard disk and safely transfer the file to the disk of another party in about 2 minutes 50 seconds, between any two personal computers registered at the key management center. The authors developed a protocol for transmitting session keys from the key management center using user-user signaling at the time of calling and making connection, to share session keys between the terminals at which communications are being conducted. Using this protocol adds about 1 second to the normal time spent calling and establishing a connection, and represents a saving in communications costs.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A multihop, wavelength division multiplex (WDM)-based network, CayleyNet, is proposed for the realization of terabit lightwave networks. CayleyNets are attractive virtual topologies because they support the largest number of nodes for four-neighbor connection in a range of diameters. In general, CayleyNets are bi-directional and there are N=p/spl times/k nodes, where p is a prime and k is a factor of p-1. The analysis shows that CayleyNet has a similar performance in channel efficiency, total and user throughput as the ShuffleNet with N=4/sup kspl times/k. However, CayleyNet has the advantages of a more flexible network size and symmetric transmission distance. Compared with the N=2/sup kspl times/k ShuffleNet and toroidal mesh, the CayleyNet has a superior performance.<<ETX>>},

pages={1252-1259 vol.3},
abstract={The implementation of ShuffleNets using a single star-coupler and slowly tunable transceivers implies maximum reconfigurability. By "maximum reconfigurability", the authors mean that any node can exchange its logical position in the network with another node by simply retuning their transceivers. This allows one to reconfigure the logical topology to adapt to the changing traffic pattern. In a multi-star network, however, one does not have the same degree of freedom for reconfiguration because one is not free to exchange the logical identities of an arbitrary pair of nodes. In the paper, the authors investigate the reconfigurability issue in the multi-star implementation of ShuffleNet. They show how one can attain maximum reconfigurability by properly choosing the system parameters. An algorithm for channels allocation is proposed to maximize reconfigurability under a particular configuration.<<ETX>>},

pages={1236-1243 vol.3},
abstract={A new, fault-tolerant, scalable, and modular virtual topology for lightwave networks employing wavelength division multiplexing is proposed. The proposed architecture is based on a hypercube connected ring structure that enjoys the rich topological properties of a hypercube, but it also overcomes one of its drawbacks. In a hypercube, the nodal degree increases with the number of nodes. Hence, the per-node cost of the network increase as the network size grows. However, in a hypercube connected ring network (HCRNet) the nodal degree is small and it remains constant, independent of the network population. The HCRNet, like the hypercube, is perfectly symmetric in the sense that average internodal distance in an N-node HCRNet is the same from any source node. Its average internodal distance is in the order of logN and it is comparable to other regular structures such as Trous and ShuffleNet. The authors present the structural properties of the HCRNet and the network routing.<<ETX>>},

abstract={In communication and computer systems, autonomous sources may assign priorities to their messages or jobs locally and independently. When a remote service (e.g., message transmission or RPC) is requested at a shared server, the server cannot use priority scheduling schemes effectively unless it can make a comparison between priorities defined by individual sources. The authors investigate the strategies under which the service received by requests of one source is not affected by the priority assignments at other sources. The first approach is a combination of processor-sharing and priority queue strategies. The second approach is to map locally defined priorities onto a global priority system. The performance of these approaches is examined in terms of the average response time of all requests, the average response time of the highest priority requests and a fairness measure.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Multimedia applications integrate a variety of media, namely, audio, video, images, graphics, text, and data. These media have different bandwidth, delay, and loss requirements. Data traffic is predominantly bursty and it requires reliable service from the network, but it can tolerate delay. In contrast, audio and video traffic is stream-oriented, it can tolerate some loss of data, but it requires delivery within a bounded delay. To support multimedia communications, it is desirable to use existing network infrastructures, which are designed specifically for data applications. In such existing network infrastructures, Ethernet is the most popular LAN scheme used. The authors have simulated 10Base-T and 100Base-T Ethernet segments carrying constant bit rate audio/video streams and data traffic (bursty and non-bursty). Given the stream rate, stream delay and loss constraints, as well as the date load and burst size, they have determined the number of streams supportable.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors propose a new approach to achieving type-of-service (TOS) with adaptive next-hop routing in wide-area networks such as the Internet.

Their approach attempts to isolate the two traffic classes by using two FCFS queues at each out-going link, one for each TOS; the link is shared cyclicly between the two TOS queues. The next-hops for the delay-sensitive traffic adapts to link delays of that traffic. The next-hops for the throughput-sensitive traffic adapts to overall link utilizations. They compare their approach with a traditional approach using discrete-event simulation and Lyapunov analysis (for stability of routes). Because of the isolation feature, the proposed approach offers lower end-to-end delays for both traffic classes.<<ETX>>},

pages={1398-1407 vol.3},
abstract={This paper presents a scheme that manages bandwidth allocation and deallocation in ring local and metropolitan area networks. The scheme is based on dividing the total ring bandwidth into a number of 64 kbits/sec channels. Isochronous channels are allocated out of this total bandwidth in a dynamic manner. The maximum isochronous bandwidth that can be allocated is theoretically limited by the ring bandwidth. Release of isochronous channels is also implemented dynamically and in a distributed manner, with minimal intervention from the monitor station. In addition, the remaining bandwidth can be used for asynchronous communication. The scheme also allows a minimum amount of bandwidth to be reserved for asynchronous communication. Another feature of this scheme is that bandwidth portions used by isochronous and asynchronous channels do not interleave, and that the isochronous channels allocated to a certain call are contiguous. The paper also shows how this scheme can be adapted to the FDDI-II network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Networks used in mission-critical applications must be highly fault-tolerant. The authors propose an FDDI-based reconfigurable network (FBRN) that can survive multiple faults. An FBRN consists of multiple FDDI trunk rings and has the ability to reconfigure itself in the face of extensive damage. They consider three classes of FBRNs depending on their degree of reconfigurability: N-FBRN (nonreconfigurable), P-FBRN (partially reconfigurable) and F-FBRN (fully reconfigurable). They analyze the performance of FBRNs in terms of their available bandwidth in the presence of faults. In mission-critical systems, it is not enough to ensure that the network is connected in spite of faults; the traffic carrying capacity of the network must be sufficient to guarantee the required quality of service. They present a probabilistic analysis of the available bandwidth of FBRNs given the number of faults. They find that a fully reconfigurable FBRN can provide a high available bandwidth even in the presence of a large number of faults. A partially reconfigurable FBRN is found to be an excellent compromise between high reliability and ease of implementation.<<ETX>>},

It may easily be applied by a network designer in evaluating and comparing different network configurations. The approximation technique is applied to a variety of FDDI network configurations. The effect of certain network parameters on the network availability are examined. From these results the authors conclude that, in order to guarantee high availability, an FDDI network backbone should be interconnected using dual attachment concentrators. Furthermore, dual-homing configurations are required for high availability paths between end-stations and the backbone. For less stringent availability requirements, single attachment concentrator trees with single attachment stations may suffice.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Two major difficulties in designing a single-hop multichannel local lightwave network are: relatively large transmitter/receiver tuning overhead and large ratio of propagation delay to packet transmission time. The authors propose several scheduling algorithms which can reduce the negative impact of tuning overhead and schedule variable-length messages. Thus, a long message can be scheduled with a single control packet transmission, instead of being segmented into many fixed-length packets, thereby significantly increasing the system's efficiency. Three novel scheduling algorithms are proposed, varying in the amount of global information and processing time. Two approximate analytical models are formulated to study the effect of tuning time and the effect of having a limited number of data channels. The system's performance is found to improve (1) if a simple mechanism is employed to avoid unnecessary transceiver tuning and/or (2) if a predictive transmitter tuning strategy is adopted.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors distinguish between four types of service that may be provided to real-time traffic by packet-switched networks, ranging from "need-blind" and "need-based best-effort" to "guaranteed throughput" and "bounded delay jitter" services. They evaluate a number of scheduling policies that offer need-based, best-effort service. They introduce hop-laxity (HL) scheduling which is based on the time remaining until the packet must reach its destination as well as the number of hops separating it from the destination. HL scheduling is evaluated through simulation and has been implemented within a BSD-based kernel and tested on the DARTnet network. The results indicate that HL scheduling tends to equalize delays between calls with large and small number of hops as compared to a FIFO discipline, reducing the 99.9% percentile of delay and the fraction of late packets. They compare HL scheduling to the FIFO+ discipline suggested by Clark et al., (see SIGCOMM Symposium on Communications Architectures and Protocols, p.14-26, 1992, and Computer Communication Review, vol.22, no.4) and find that their delay properties are similar. Other disciplines, such as minimum laxity or transit priority, may actually do more harm than good.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new model of nonuniform traffic is introduced for a single-hop packet switching system. This traffic model allows arbitrary traffic streams subject only to a constraint on the number of data packets which can arrive at any individual source in the system or for any individual destination in the system over time periods of specified length. The nonuniform traffic model is flexible enough to cover integrated data networks carrying diverse classes of data. The system model is rather general and includes passive optical star wavelength division networks. Transmission algorithms are introduced for a single-hop packet switching system with such nonuniform traffic and with propagation delay that is negligible relative to the packet length. The algorithms are based on collision-free scheduling of packets using graph matching algorithms, since the global state of the system is known to all stations at any time.<<ETX>>},

In this paper the computational complexity of such a problem is analyzed in the cases of fixed and dynamically variable paths. Unfortunately, it turns out that both of the versions of the considered problem are NP-complete even under very restrictive hypothesis. Moreover, they are not approximable, that is, they can be solved only by polynomial-time heuristic algorithms such that the distance between the exact and the approximate solution is not bounded by any fixed value.<<ETX>>},

For the uniform DQDB with equal distance between adjacent nodes, the authors show that the system operates under three basic behavior profiles and a finite number of their combinations that depend on the load of the network. Consequently, the system is not fair at any load in terms of the average waiting times. In the vicinity of a critical load of 1-4/N the uniform network runs into a state akin to chaos, where its behavior fluctuates from one extreme to the other with a load variation of 2/N. The analysis is supported by simulation results. The authors also show that the main theme of the analysis carries over to the general (non-uniform) DQDB.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The isochronous channel reuse problem (ICRP) on DQDB metropolitan area networks is investigated. Given a set of established isochronous connections and a set of isochronous requests, the goal is to use a minimal number of isochronous channels to service these requests. On the other hand, given a limited isochronous bandwidth, the goal is to establish a maximal number of isochronous connections. In the paper, the authors show that the ICRP is NP-complete. For the simplified ICRP (SICRP), in which all the established isochronous connections as well as the isochronous requests are of the same bandwidth, the authors suggest a tight lower bound and propose an efficient isochronous channel reuse algorithm (ICRA). Simulation results show that for the SICRP, the solutions obtained by the ICRA are very close to the lower bound which implies the proposed ICRA is very attractive. For a limited isochronous bandwidth, the number of successful established isochronous connections obtained by the ICRA is much more than that of the original DQDB isochronous channels allocation scheme.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The paper presents a new MAC protocol, rate-based headend request control (RHRC), for dual unidirectional bus networks, which overcomes the unfairness of DQDB by allowing each station to generate multiple requests while retaining most of the positive features of DQDB, including 100% bandwidth utilization and low access delay at very low load. In addition, the protocol has two attractive features. Firstly, the transmission mechanism controlling station access to the data channel is able to provide approximately equal opportunity to messages so that they experience almost the same average delay independent of their physical locations and the traffic distribution. Secondly, the bandwidth allocation mechanism can achieve fair bandwidth sharing among stations when the network is overloaded, while maintaining fairness in terms of message delay amongst the underloaded stations. This mechanism also results in a shorter transient period than the bandwidth balancing mechanism of DQDB. Simulation results are included and comparisons are made with DQDB.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) protocol, which has been specified by the IEEE 802.6 as the metropolitan area networks (MANs) standard, has an undesirable feature that busy slots that have been already received (i.e. read) continue to propagate downstream unnecessarily. The use of special nodes, known as erasure nodes, allows conversion of read slots to empty, so that downstream nodes may reuse these slots. This should result in an increase of the total throughput of the network. In the paper, the authors introduce and evaluate the performance of an erasure node algorithm. The algorithm keeps track of past activities on both buses to effectively balance the slot erasure and the request cancellation functions. They show that this algorithm possesses a number of features which make it superior to existing algorithms.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A secret sharing scheme is a method which allows a secret to be shared among a finite set of participants in such a way that only qualified subsets of participants can recover it. A secret sharing scheme is called perfect if unqualified subsets of participants obtain no information about the secret. The authors propose an efficient construction of perfect secret sharing schemes for the access structures consisting of the closure of a graph where a vertex denotes a participant and an edge denotes a minimal qualified pairs of participants. The information rate of the scheme is at least 1/(2|P|), where P denotes the set of the participants, which is better than O(1/|P|/sup 2/) of existing schemes used for graph-based access structures. The authors also present an application of the scheme to the reduction of storage and computation loads on the key distribution server in a secure network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Datagram networks such as the Internet do not provide guaranteed resources such as bandwidth or guaranteed performance measures such as maximum delay. One way to support packet video in these networks is to use feedback mechanisms that adapt the output rate of video coders based on the state of the network. The authors present one such mechanism. They describe the feedback information, and how it is used by the coder control algorithm. They also examine how the need to operate in a multicast environment impacts the design of the control mechanism. This mechanism has been implemented in the H.261 video coder of IVS. IVS is a videoconference system for the Internet developed at INRIA. Experiments indicate that the control mechanism is well suited to the Internet environment. In particular, it makes it possible to establish and maintain quality videoconferences even across congested connections in the Internet. Furthermore, it prevents video sources from swamping the resources of the Internet, which could lead to unacceptable service to all users of the network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Due to the demand for high-speed and multimedia services, ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks have increasingly received high attention. The multimedia services in ATM networks have diverse traffic characteristics and service requirements, appropriate traffic controls of call admission and congestion are needed so as to guarantee the required quality of service (QOS) for services. Previous studies on the traffic control were based on the results of queueing analyses. In the present paper, an alternative traffic control for admission in conjunction with congestion based on fuzzy set theory are proposed for an ATM network. The performance evaluation via simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the equivalent capacity in Guerin et al.

abstract={It has been observed by many authors that under reasonable regularity conditions, the stationary distribution of queued work in a queueing system has an exponential tail. This has been observed in practise in a great variety of communications systems. The main result of this paper is a general equation for the decay coefficient of this tail. A procedure for estimating the weight of the tail is also described. The proof relies on the assumption that future values of the net input process are independent of values in the past after a sufficiently long delay but the equation does not reflect this assumption and it is conjectured that the formula holds good even when the input process retains some degree of correlation over time intervals of arbitrary length. Several examples are considered including some which do not assume that the distribution of the inputs is Gaussian. The method for determining the decay coefficient for the tail in these examples relies on finding the zero of a sample nonlinear equation.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A technique is presented to carry asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) cell streams over a lower speed synchronous transmission network. Although focus is on transport of gigabit cell streams over a lower order synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) network, the proposed functionality is in fact directly applicable to any ATM stream over any lower speed synchronous network. The approach is a single ATM virtual path (VP) connection supported by multipath transmission. Delay equalisation is performed through a set of first-in first-out (FIFO) queues at the receiver side, which get mutually synchronised by the initial retrieval action of their common server. After start up, all FIFOs will exhibit different filling levels, compensating the delay differences along the paths. Once operational, no further transmission overhead is imposed. The proposed actions take place in the uppermost part of the physical layer.<<ETX>>},

volume={},

pages={1150-1159 vol.3},
abstract={In almost all conventional transport protocols, ARQs (automatic repeat request) have been used to recover lost packets, in which receivers would request sources to retransmit lost packets. In these retransmission based error recovery schemes, the transmission delay can reach an unacceptable level for traffic with stringent delay constraints in high speed networks because their propagation delay is very large relative to packet transmission times. On the other hand, FEC (forward error correction) adds redundant packets to data ones, all of which are organized into a group called a block, and hence allows the receivers to correct some of the lost packets without retransmissions. This capability is desirable for high speed networks. The authors exactly analyze the distribution of the number of cells lost within a block in ATM networks with correlated cell arrivals, and examine the benefits due to FEC by means of the analysis.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The paper reports the findings of a simulation studying the queueing behavior of "best-effort" traffic in the presence of constant-bit-rate (CBR) and variable bit-rate (VBR) isochronous traffic. In the study, best-effort traffic refers to ATM cells that support communication between host end systems executing various applications and exchanging information using TCP/IP. The performance measures considered are TCP cell loss, TCP packet loss, mean cell queueing delay, and mean cell queue length. The simulation results show that, under certain conditions, best-effort TCP traffic may experience as much as 2% cell loss. The results also show that the probability of cell and packet loss decreases logarithmically with increased buffer size.<<ETX>>},

They find that IP traffic shows temporal locality of reference and so least recently used (LRU)-based policies perform well. A system-wide timeout, which is a special case of an LRU policy, is quite effective when the timeout value is chosen correctly. The policies proposed are easy to implement and solve the problem satisfactorily.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A cell based MAC protocol provides both efficient bandwidth utilisation and easy interfacing with the emerging ATM technology. Therefore the slotted approach is being favoured for data transmission and admission control in distributed LANs operating at data rates of more than one Gbit/s. Spatial slot reuse through destination release has been found to be the most effective way towards improving system throughput. That basic mechanism, however, is unfair by giving preference to stations positioned upstream in the ring circulation direction. The paper discusses approaches for an asynchronous media access control in slotted rings. After a general overview of system throughput obtained by an analytical model, the feasibility of various MAC proposals called ATMR, CRMA-II, Distributor, and MetaRing are compared based on simulation results. Differences in the mechanisms are analysed with a particular respect to the tradeoff between high throughput and the guarantee of bounded packet delays. It is shown, that all approaches are generally suitable to meet the requirements of the new LAN generation.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The exhaustive cycle-gated (ECG) scheme was proposed as a high throughput access mechanism for high speed bus protocols like Expressnet and Fasnet. However, the ECG scheme exhibits unfairness to the downstream station which suffers higher mean and variance of waiting time. In the paper the authors propose and analyze a new cycle-gated scheme, the shifting cycle-gated (SCG) scheme, on the Expressnet topology. They demonstrate that the SCG scheme is fair to all the stations in the sense that the mean and variance of the waiting time are the same for all stations, irrespective of the spatial distribution of the stations on the bus and the service time distribution of the packets at the stations, for uniform load. The SCG scheme achieves this fairness by shifting the order of service of stations from one cycle to the next. The analysis methodology uses space-time diagrams to derive expressions for the moment generating function, mean and variance of the waiting time under assumptions of independent nonsymmetric Poisson arrival processes at N stations on the bus. Extensive numerical results illustrate the behavior of the SCG protocol.<<ETX>>},

This addresses the combined connection admission and flow control problem (generic functions for managing and controlling traffic and congestion in BISDN). Using a novel control concept, based on only two groups of traffic (controllable and uncontrollable) they formulate a problem aimed at high (unity) utilisation of resources while maintaining quality of service at prescribed levels. Bounds on operating conditions are derived, and using simulation they show that high utilisation can be achieved as suggested by the theory, together with robustness for unforeseen traffic connections and disconnections. Even with such a high efficiency and strong properties on the quality of service, the only traffic descriptor required from the user is that of the peak rate of the uncontrollable traffic.<<ETX>>},

For media streams such as file transfers, the preservation of bursts and the provision of guarantees for loss probability at the burst level is of primary importance, while, for media streams such as voice, loss guarantees at the cell level are sufficient. Continuous media have stringent delay jitter requirements. Finally, some applications require loss-free transmission. In this paper the first complete traffic management scheme for multimedia ATM networks is introduced supporting a wide variety of quality of service requirements. The operation of the traffic management scheme is completely specified, and real-time admission control algorithms are provided.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Traffic consisting of two classes (0 and 1) arrives at a buffer in a bursty fashion. The type-0 traffic is always admitted into the buffer (of size B/sub 0/) as long as there is space for it. Type-1 traffic is admitted to the buffer only if the buffer content does not exceed a threshold B/sub 1spl les/B/sub 0/. The authors develop an analytical model to determine the bandwidth allocation in order to ensure that the packet loss probability of type-i traffic does not exceed /spl epsisub i/, where 0</spl epsisub 0spl lesspl epsisub 1/<1 are given numbers. These results extend the notion of effective bandwidth of a single class traffic. They also studied the variation of this effective bandwidth with the buffer threshold and with the amount of high priority traffic. This study provides valuable insights into the buffer dimensioning problem as well as the amount of bandwidth that can be saved by using priority discard mechanisms.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The future telecommunication networks are expected to support a wide variety of multimedia services with very different bit-rate and performance requirements. Under these circumstances, it has been recognized that the conventional simple source modeling, namely, the Poisson arrival process, is no longer adequate to describe various kinds of traffic sources accurately. Other source modelings, which give more accurate results but greatly complicate the performance analyses, have been proposed. However, all these models share a common property, that is, they can be decomposed into a superposition of independent identical interrupted Poisson processes (IPP). In order to obtain a balance between the accuracy and the complexity of analysis, the authors propose to approximate an IPP, a basic component of various models, by a Poisson distribution and use the Chen-Stein (1975, 1972) method to find an upper bound of this approximation error.<<ETX>>},

pages={1038-1045 vol.3},
abstract={The authors model an ATM virtual circuit as a tandem queueing system. At each queue, transmission of the virtual circuit traffic is interrupted by cross traffic, causing the scattering and coalescing of cells. They study this phenomenon using entropy as a traffic descriptor. They compute the entropy of traffic streams produced in simulation, via an estimation technique based on the Lempel-Ziv universal data compression method. The estimator modifies the Lempel-Ziv method to compute entropy rather than compress data. They show that the entropy of virtual circuit traffic at successive queues can either increase or decrease depending upon the types of input traffic. Even when bursty input is scattered, its entropy does not achieve maximum entropy within a reasonable number of queues. They also define a distance metric to compare the correlation structures of two output processes and observe this metric at successive queue outputs.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors introduce a deterministic fluid model and two stochastic traffic models for wireless networks. The setting is a highway with multiple entrances and exits. Vehicles are classified as calling or non-calling, depending on whether they have calls in progress. The deterministic model ignores the behavior of individual vehicles and treats them as a continuous fluid, whereas the stochastic traffic models consider the random behavior of each vehicle. However, all three model's use the same two coupled partial (or ordinary) differential equations to describe the system evolution. The call density and call handoff rate (or their expected values in the stochastic models) are readily computable by solving these equations. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate how the models can be used to investigate various aspects of time and space dynamics in wireless networks. These examples also show that the models can serve as useful tools for system engineering and planning.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Considers a single-server finite-buffer system. Its stationary random input process as characterized by the power spectrum P(/spl omega/) and the input rate steady state distribution f(x). The two functions represent second-order and steady-state input statistics. The authors use the superposition of heterogeneous 2-state Markov chains (MC) for construction of P(/spl omega/) and f(x). The resulting P(/spl omega/) is a monotone function of |/spl omega/|, and f(x) is the convolution of heterogeneous binomial functions. They show how to eliminate the state space explosion in input modeling. Unlike the existing modeling technique which matches the 2-state MC with each individual source, their 2-state MC are built to statistically match with functions P(/spl omega/) and f(x) of the aggregate input. The input state space is then reduced by many orders of magnitude. They examine the maximum throughput of a finite-buffer system to support P(/spl omega/) and f(x) subject to a desired average loss rate L. The numerical study explores a fundamental limit of buffer sizing to the maximum throughput improvement. A simple heuristic formula is developed, which tells quantitatively whether a given finite-buffer system operates in a so-called buffer-noneffective region. The new insight relating link capacity to low frequency input statistics explored in the paper is a fruitful starting point for further research.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present a new viewserver hierarchy and associated protocols that (1) satisfies policy and type-of-service (ToS) constraints, (2) adapts to dynamic topology changes including failures that partition domains, and (3) scales well to a large number of domains without losing detail. Domain-level views are maintained by special nodes called viewservers. Each viewserver maintains a domain-level view of a surrounding precinct. Viewservers are organized hierarchically. To obtain domain-level source routes, the views of one or more viewservers are merged (up to a maximum of twice the levels in the hierarchy). Their evaluation results indicate that the viewserver hierarchy finds many short valid paths and reduces the amount of memory requirement by two orders of magnitude.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The diffusing update algorithms (DUAL) constitute a family of distributed routing algorithms that has been shown to be loop-free at every instant, to converge after an arbitrary sequence of link-cost or topological changes, and to outperform all other loop-free routing algorithms previously proposed from the standpoint of the combined temporal, message, and storage complexities. Two hierarchical routing schemes based on DUAL are presented to make it more applicable to very large internets. A scheme based on McQuillan's (1974, 1980) hierarchical routing scheme and a backbone-oriented scheme, similar to the one used in OSPF, are introduced to reduce the amount of routing information maintained at each router. The performance of these schemes is compared by simulation to the performance of the basic DUAL, an ideal routing algorithm based on topology broadcast, and OSPF. The simulation results suggest that DUAL with areas outperforms OSPF, and provide additional insight on the performance of OSPF, EIGRP, and area-based routing algorithms in general.<<ETX>>},

volume={},

pages={984-991 vol.3},
abstract={In computer networks there is usually a trade-off between the performance and implementation complexity of the routing protocol, and those of the protocol for reliable transmission of data. Often, the routing protocol can perform better if it is not required to retain the FIFO order of the routed data units. However, in such a case the protocol for reliable transmission of data has to maintain many logical timers and to have an accurate estimate of the round trip delay. The paper introduces a new notion: semi-FIFO service, which means that the routing layer retains the FIFO order in part. The paper shows that sometimes a non-FIFO routing layer may easily provide for a semi-FIFO service, without changing the routing concept. Then, at proposes a new protocol for reliable transmission of data over an unreliable semi-FIFO routing layer. The protocol uses only one logical timer and does not require an estimate of the round trip delay in order to operate with maximum capacity. Therefore, the contribution of the paper is eliminating the deficiencies associated with a non-FIFO routing layer that may offer a semi-FIFO service.<<ETX>>},

The objectives of the protocol are reduced average latency per packet, support of broadcast multicast, collisionless communication, and the exploitation of the inherent distributed shared memory traffic characteristics. A hybrid strategy, in terms of channel reservation, is described that trades maximum capacity for reduced communication latency to improve system response. The performance of the protocol is analyzed through analytic and simulation models with varying system parameters such as number of nodes and channels. The performance of the new protocol is compared to a TDM-based protocol and their relative merits and demerits are examined.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Passive star-coupled optical interconnects with wavelength-division multiplexing hold a strong potential for realizing flexible large-scale multicomputer networks. Virtual point-to-point regular connectivities can be defined and modified in a network with broadcast-select routing via distributed wavelength assignment to the nodes. The system size in this approach is bound by the number of separable wavelength channels. The paper proposes a network class that achieves scalability by grouping the nodes into clusters and employing a separate pair of broadcast and select couplers with each cluster. Interconnecting the clusters according to a regular topology results in a modular architecture with reconfigurable partitions and significantly reduced fiber link density. This approach efficiently combines wavelength-division with direct space interconnection, taking advantage of the properties of each. For the topologies of most significance to parallel computing, the paper studies conflict-free wavelength assignment that maximizes spatial reuse, identifies the valid network partitions, and evaluates the fiber link density and both space and wavelength channel throughput improvement. The results show that cube and shuffle networks take most advantage of the proposed approach in terms of maximizing wavelength reuse.<<ETX>>},

abstract={This paper deals with a novel strategy for connection admission control in ATM networks. This strategy, called worst deterministic pattern allocation (WDPA), aims at reaping statistical gain of ATM, through a simple and controllable bandwidth allocation. WDPA is based on the concept of preventively constraining information sources to emit their cells according to a superimposed deterministic mask. Resource allocation is performed taking into account only the parameters of the declared deterministic mask. The same allocation rule is utilized in every network section. Application of WDPA to input and output queueing switches is also discussed and its compatibility with both these architectures is demonstrated. A performance study is presented. A comparison of the efficiency resulting from WDPA application with that relevant to peak allocation and pure statistical allocation is presented. Results show that, by fixing a maximum transit delay, WDPA outperforms statistical allocation if path length exceed few hops.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors propose a microeconomic approach to service provisioning in ATM networks. The provisioning procedure consists of two algorithms, one executed by the network and the other by individual users. The network offers directly for rent its bandwidth and buffers. Users purchase freely resources to meet their desired quality based on their own traffic parameters and delay requirements. The network periodically adjusts resource prices based on user requests monitored in the previous period. They describe the networks adjustment scheme and users' decision rule, and show that under the proposed price adjustment scheme, in order to minimize their own service cost, individual users will indeed request amounts of resources that optimize a measure of overall network performance. Since this approach does not require the network to know user traffic and delay parameters, it does not mandate traffic policing on the part of the network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={For future broadband-ISDN, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is designed not only to support a wide range of traffic classes with diverse flow characteristics (e.g., burstiness, bit rate and burst length), but to guarantee the different quality of service (QOS) requirements as well. The QOS may be measured in terms of cell loss probability and maximum cell delay. The authors consider the ATM network in which the virtual path (VP) concept is implemented. By applying the Markov modulated deterministic process method, they develop an efficient algorithm to compute the minimum capacity required to satisfy all the QOS requirements when multiple classes of on-off sources are multiplexed onto a single VP. Using the result, they then propose a simple algorithm to determine the VP combination to achieve the near optimum of the total capacity required for satisfying the individual QOS requirements. Numerical results are also presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm when compared to the optimal total capacity required.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Most work in video traffic modelling has concentrated on the frame level and little work has been done to model the cell level traffic. The authors give the cell inter-arrival statistics for several sequences and used them in a multiplexer simulation to obtain cell loss results. Many models have assumed that the cell level traffic is Poisson. They show that the cell inter-arrival is not i.i.d., but is correlated. This is due to the fact that in image coding the compression scheme is only applied locally. Thus, some correlation still remains in the cell stream produced. The cell loss obtained were larger than those from the uniform cell spacing and Poisson assumptions, and the cell burst loss length distribution was found to be approximated by a geometric distribution.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Video traffic is expected to become increasingly important with the large scale deployment of broadband ISDN. In the literature, it suggested that smoothing variable bit rate (VBR) video traffic before transmitting it onto the network would help reduce the probability of packet loss. The authors show why deterministic smoothing at the source approximates the minimum achievable loss over the network end-to-end of all possible smoothing schemes. Furthermore, they develop a powerful yet simple analytical technique that can efficiently calculate the loss probability at any point in a network carrying video traffic. They validate the analytical results using traces of actual video segments. The results can be used for admission control and traffic management. They find that in the case of highly correlated traffic such as video, the way to control loss is to ensure that the fraction of time the arrival process exceeds the service process is small.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors review the results of a two-level control framework for integrated video and image traffic in an ATM multiplexer. The framework gives priority to video traffic, and uses flow control on the image traffic in order to prevent congestion while improving its throughput. It functions on two levels, or time scales. Buffer management and scheduling are done at the level of cell arrivals and departures, or microsecond time scales, while flow control is done at the burst level, or millisecond time scales. The control framework guarantees upper bounds on cell loss rates for both video and image traffic over a defined control interval, with a specified probability.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Circuit-switched networks of video users with different grades of service are considered. The authors consider admission control schemes that result in an increase to network throughput at the expense of some fraction of the information (rate) transmitted by the video sources being dropped. The end-to-end probability of blocking video requests and the associated probability of rate dropping of video sources are evaluated along each network path for the above control schemes and for an arbitrary circuit-switched network architecture. Instead of the exact expressions, which require prohibitive computational effort, the stochastic knapsack approximation and the Monte Carlo summation method are employed.<<ETX>>},

A multicast connection is decomposed into associated cubes such that each cube can be self-routed through the network. The context of this work is a recursive scheme for multistage network where the outlets are fed back to the inlets through external links. Three routing algorithms are proposed.

The incorporation of multicast (point-to-multipoint) functions require packet duplications. If the copy network were placed on the feedforward path of the switch, it is not transparent to, and can interfere with, point-to-point switching. By placing the copy network in the feedback position, its operation can be made transparent to the point-to-point information transfer. The copy network incorporated onto the SCOQ switch is non-blocking even without an arbitration or selection network. Contrary to the feedforward approach in which the input buffers must be centrally controlled, with the copy network in the feedback loop, the input buffers all operate independent of each other.<<ETX>>},

pages={280-287 vol.1},
abstract={Fair distributed queue (FDQ) is a high speed metropolitan area network proposed by Kabatepe (1992). FDQ has fair throughput, and delay characteristics and is a highly scalable protocol in that its performance is little affected by growing networks sizes, and/or transmission speeds. While FDQ allocates equal bandwidth to all active nodes, the authors focus on dividing the capacity arbitrarily among the active nodes. Under heavy load, this would result in nodes achieving throughput rates equal to their allocated bandwidths. Under normal load conditions, they aim to provide equal quality of service to the nodes in terms of message delay, if their arrival rates turn out to be equal to their allocated bandwidths. They present the bandwidth allocation FDQ (BA-FDQ) protocol which achieves this objective subject to propagation delays. The delay characteristics of BA-FDQ are compared via simulation with FDQ, DQDB and DQDB with BWB under symmetric load (an important special case in the absence of known arrival rates). They also consider arbitrary bandwidth allocations and study the delay characteristics of BA-FDQ by simulation. The studies show that BA-FDQ makes the mean message delays of individual nodes close to each other as intended for transmissions on one of the buses.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Research in photonics is currently aimed at ways to exploit the enormous information-carrying capacity of optical fiber. Many networks based upon wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) have recently been proposed using passive star couplers. However, new advances in travelling-wave and doped-fiber amplifiers have sparked interest in multichannel ring and bus networks. A new network architecture is proposed which is applicable to both multichannel folded busses and rings. The motivation behind the designs is to simplify the user stations as much as possible, thus giving an economical implementation. As proposed by Janoska and Todd (see GLOBECOM'93, vol.1, p.481-487, 1993) this is accomplished through the use of a headend channel controller which assists in the operation of the networks.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors provide sample techniques for estimating the end-to-end jitter incurred to a periodic traffic in an ATM network. The analysis is based on carefully examining the light and heavy traffic behavior of jitter incurred to a general tagged renewal stream in a single node. The results indicate that for any number of nodes, the jitter variance is almost proportional to the variance of the background traffic competing for resources with the tagged stream. They also find that in general, as the number of nodes increases, the jitter distribution approaches a limit. In the heavy traffic, they provide the functional equation satisfying this limit which readily gives all the moments of the jitter in closed form for large number of nodes in the network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={This paper considers the multiplexing of nondeterministic periodic traffic sources which deliver packets periodically according to an arbitrary i.i.d. batch arrival process. The proposed traffic sources are representative of the packet-stream periodicities commonly found in high-speed packet networks such as ATM. An exact analytical technique, which entails the solution of Markov chains whose dimensions are independent of the periods associated with the input sources, is presented for the study of a finite-capacity multiplexer fed by N of the proposed traffic models. Numerical results indicate that the source periodicities have a significant impact on the multiplexers performance. In fact, for some regions of operating conditions, even a Poisson traffic assumption is shown to provide an extremely pessimistic estimate of the queue performance measured in terms of packet-loss probabilities.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors study discrete-time, single server queueing systems, with messages that consist of blocks of consecutive cells. They focus on the model of dispersed cell generation processes which naturally arises in packet switched networks such as ATM. Several important performance measures are considered. These are the message delay process, the maximum delay of a cell in a message and the number of cells in a message whose delays exceed a pre-specified time threshold. The latter two quantities are important for proper design of playback algorithms and time-out mechanisms. They present a new analytical approach that yields efficient recursions for the computation of the probability distribution of each quantity. Numerical examples are provided to compare this distribution with the distribution obtained by using an independence assumption on the cell delays. These examples show that the correlation between cell delays of the same message has a strong effect on each of these quantities.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Addresses the problem of virtual path routing for survivable ATM networks. An algorithm is developed to find a virtual path configuration and bandwidth assignment which minimizes the expected amount of lost flow upon network restoration from a failure. The concept of two-step restoration is introduced to achieve fast restoration as well as optimal reconfiguration. The problem can be formulated as a nonlinear nonsmooth multicommodity flow problem with linear constraints. A modified flow deviation approach is developed to obtain the steepest decent direction for a nonsmooth objective function. Based on the proposed scheme, convergence to a near-optimum is possible by properly adjusting optimization parameters.<<ETX>>},

Direct virtual paths link local switches directly and enable channel set up processing to be eliminated from transit nodes. However, this configuration, which employs no toll switches, suffers from several problems such as reduced utilization of virtual path bandwidth and increased difficulty of localized network management based on network segmentation. The authors introduce virtual path bandwidth control and the virtual path group concept into ATM transport networks to realize the direct virtual path configuration in a very efficient manner. Virtual path bandwidth control enables the optimum balance between switching and transmission systems to be struck. Virtual path groups make it possible to provide a localized network management capability in a way similar to that available in a conventional network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={In ATM networks, two levels of connections are defined: virtual path connections and virtual channel connections. Virtual paths are the building blocks of the virtual channels. This hierarchy, known as "the virtual path concept", provides considerable advantages in the design of high-speed networks. In the paper the authors show that this concept has the advantage of providing a means of improving the survivability of virtual channels. To this end, they present a simple rerouting protocol, which can be invoked upon the failure of an intermediate link or node of a virtual path. This protocol reroutes all the affected virtual channels to an alternative virtual path. Due to the simplicity of the protocol, it can be completed rapidly, thus fulfilling an essential requirement of any rerouting scheme.<<ETX>>},

The key architectural idea in SWIM is to put some processing logic inside each memory chip that allows it to perform data manipulation operations locally and to communicate directly with a disk or communication line. A complex communication task can be distributed between a large number of small memory processors each doing a sub-task, while still retaining a common locus of control for operation, administration and maintenance functions. This enables more powerful, scalable and robust designs for communications subsystems that can support emerging network services, multimedia workstations and wireless PCS systems.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors study the effectiveness of different parallel architectures for achieving high throughputs necessary for processing signaling traffic in high speed networks. They consider shared memory and distributed memory parallel architectures for processing signaling messages. A key performance issue is the trade-off between load balancing gains and call record management overhead; arranging processors in large groups potentially yields higher load balancing gains but also incurs higher overhead in maintaining consistency amongst the replicated copies of the call records. They study this tradeoff and its impact on the choice of optimal parallel architectures for protocol processing. The results show that for shared memory architectures, which provide the maximal load balancing gains, organizing the processors in small groups optimizes the performance for a wide range of traffic loads. For distributed memory architectures, which do not inherently provide any load balancing, organizing the processors into small groups and using a simple distributed load balancing scheme yields modest performance gains even after call record management overheads are taken into account. A good architecture is a hybrid one using a distributed architecture in which each node is a small processing group with shared memory.<<ETX>>},

abstract={In this work, the performance scalability of ATM functions in the B-ISDN framework is explored. The aim is to identify the potential bottlenecks in designing circuits for ATM systems and to evaluate the effect of these limitations on system performance. Dependency relationships are used to illustrate and analyse the designs,given varying degrees of parallelism. The data flow in the receiver and transmitter sections are analysed to identify the critical delay paths. The design considerations imposed by SONET framing are also discussed. Limitations imposed by AAL-5, which is the preferred ATM adaptation layer for data networks, are identified. Finally, the results are combined to establish an overall limit on performance.<<ETX>>},

abstract={This paper considers the combined problem of finding allocation of wavelengths to the stations (configuration) and finding the associated routing of the traffic to minimize congestion (the amount of maximum flow on any link). This work presents efficient algorithms for computing both upper and lower bounds on the congestion. The upper bounds-to obtain approximate solutions of this problem-are based modification of two heuristics (i) variable depth local search, and (ii) simulated annealing. A more significant contribution is a lower bound computation based on building flow trees to find a lower bound on the total flow, and then distributing the total flow over the links provide a lower bound on the congestion. This technique yields a tool which can be used in evaluating the quality of heuristic algorithms, and determining a termination criteria during minimization. This technique can be applied to other problems with flow-based objectives. Performance of the heuristics is analysed, and compared via simulation studies. It is shown that the heuristics perform on the average, within 20% of the computed lower bound, and 15% better than the previous methods to solve this problem.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Deflection routing plays a prominent role in many optical network architectures, because it can be implemented with modest packet-buffering requirements. From the practical perspective, however, the implementation of deflection routing, which is normally based on global time slotting, might pose challenges. The authors develop approaches to the implementation of both slotted and unslotted deflection-routing optical networks. They analyse important tradeoffs that are inherent to the design of optical deflection-routing networks and compare the performance of slotted and unslotted networks. Under a reasonable set of assumptions about optical technology, the results suggest that the unslotted link protocol should be the preferred approach to building the optical deflection-routing network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Explores design principles for next generation optical wide-area networks, employing wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), and targeted to nationwide coverage. This almost-all-optical network will exploit wavelength multiplexers and optical switches in routing nodes, so that arbitrary virtual topologies may be imbedded on a given physical network. The virtual topology, which is packet switched and which consists of a set of all-optical lightpaths, is set up to exploit the relative strengths of both optics and electronics viz. packets of information are carried by the virtual topology "as far as possible" in the optical domain, but packet forwarding from lightpath to lightpath is performed via electronic switching, whenever required. Algorithms are developed so that the WDM-based network architecture will (a) provide a high aggregate system capacity due to spatial reuse of wavelengths, and (b) support a large and scalable number of users, given a limited number of wavelengths. The authors illustrate their approaches by employing experimental traffic statistics collected from NSFNET.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A closed-loop, rate-based congestion control mechanism for ATM cell relay networks is presented. The goal of the congestion control mechanism is to guarantee the negotiated quality of service during overload conditions, and to allow a connection to exceed its negotiated throughput when there is unused capacity along its path through the network. With this control mechanism, the rate of an end system is adjusted based on both the network congestion state and whether its rate is within the negotiated parameters. The performance of this control mechanism for file transfer traffic is illustrated by results from simulations, Using a simple analytical model, the worst case buffer requirement and file transfer delay are analysed. From the analysis, conditions are derived for the rate increment, rate decrease factor and initial rate that minimize the buffer requirement and file transfer delay. From the analytical results, an adaptive rate reduction scheme is suggested to improve performance.<<ETX>>},

abstract={It has previously been found that feedback in an ATM network is useful in the long run to alleviate congestion. This general conclusion, although theoretically important, does not address the practical concern as to how the network behaves when it is adjusting itself in the short to medium range. The work reported in the paper is motivated by this practical concern. A new feedback based dynamic traffic control mechanism (called the balanced mechanism) is proposed and compared with the pure preventive congestion control (PCC) and an existing feedback based mechanism, known as explicit forward congestion notification (EFCN). It is shown that the balanced mechanism outperforms both PCC and the EFCN.<<ETX>>},

year={1994},
volume={},

pages={81-90 vol.1},
abstract={The paper presents a novel approach to dynamic transmission bandwidth allocation for transport of real-time variable-bit-rate video in ATM networks. The authors describe video traffic in the frequency domain: the low frequency signal captures the slow time-variation of consecutive scene changes; the high frequency signal exhibits the feature of strong frame autocorrelation. The study indicates that the video transmission bandwidth in a finite-buffer system is essentially characterized by the low, frequency signal. Since the time scale of scene changes is usually in the range of a second or longer, the low frequency video signal is defined in a well-founded low frequency band. Hence, it is feasible to implement dynamic allocation of video transmission bandwidth using on-line observation and prediction of scene changes. Two prediction schemes are examined: the recursive least square method vs. the time delay neural network method. A time delay neural network with low-complexity high-order architecture, called a "pi-sigma network", is successfully used to predict scene changes. The proposed dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme is shown to be promising and practically feasible in obtaining efficient transmission of real-time video traffic with guaranteed quality of services.<<ETX>>},

The joint PDF of the number of bandwidth units in use, is found using a known recursion formula that is amenable to numerically instability. An algorithm that fixes the instability is proposed.

abstract={A queueing network structured as a directed tree, where only transmissions towards its head are allowed, is considered. Input to each queue is assumed to follow a discrete-time Gaussian process. To compute loss probabilities, each queue is considered independently and its input statistics are derived by approximating output statistics of its immediate sources. Performance statistics of a single Gaussian queue can be accurately approximated as a function of three parameters: the mean and variance of the arrival process, and a parameter related to the asymptotic rate of the long term variance. Of these three parameters only the variance changes when the traffic is filtered through an infinite buffer queue. The authors derive an approximation of the variance of the output process. Comparisons with simulations show that the approximation is accurate. Having the parameters of the output process, the single queue analysis is extended to a tree type network of queues. A small example of a network of three queues is simulated and the performance results are found to be close to results obtained analytically.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors analyze the effect of fixed delay in conjunction with queueing and resequencing delay on the optimal distribution of traffic on multiple disjoint paths. They study a system of two hosts or end nodes, connected by a high speed network communicating on two virtual channels which follow disjoint physical paths. The paths have a different number of hops and/or physical length which leads to a different amount of constant delay for each of them. The variable delay on each path is modelled by a queue with exponential service. Furthermore the destination node delivers packets an the order they arrived at the source node, which entails additional resequencing delay. They find the optimal split of traffic, so as to minimize the total average system time (including the resequencing delay). The results show that the optimal splitting probability may be heavily dependant on the difference in the fixed delays on the two paths. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effect of fixed delay on the fraction of traffic routed to different paths. Performance can be further improved when they do a deterministic split of the traffic.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Reuse partitioning is a technique for providing more efficient spectrum reuse in cellular radio systems. A cell in such a system is divided into concentric zones, each associated with an overlaid cell plan. Calls that arise in the periphery of the cell have fewer channels in their availability than those arising close to the base station and therefore they experience higher blocking rates. The authors consider the problem of balancing uniformly the blocking probability throughout the cell offering a fair treatment to the whole area within the cell, by controlling the allocation do the different channel layers. A policy that minimizes the maximum blocking probability experienced at any location of the cell is identified and is shows to be of threshold type, An adaptive scheme that adjusts the threshold based on estimates of the blocking probabilities in the different zones of the cell as proposed. This scheme tracks the optimal threshold effectively without any knowledge of the traffic parameters. Simulation study shows that substantial capacity improvements care achieved by the application of the optimal channel assignment policy, over the uncontrolled system.<<ETX>>},

They derive an upper bound on the carried traffic of connections (or equivalently, a lower bound on the blocking probability) for any routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) algorithm in such a network. The bound scales with the number of wavelengths and is achieved asymptotically (when a large number of wavelengths is available) by a fixed RWA algorithm. Although computationally intensive, this bound can be used as a metric against which the performance of different RWA algorithms can be compared for networks of moderate size. They illustrate this by comparing the performance of a simple RWA algorithm via simulation with our bound. They also derive a similar bound for optical networks using dynamic wavelength converters, which are equivalent to circuit-switched telephone networks, and compare the two cases for different examples.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Rerouting for a circuit-switched wavelength-division-multiplexed all-optical network is considered in the paper. Due to the wavelength continuity constraint, a new connection may be blocked even if bandwidth is available between the origin and the destination. Rerouting can make the available bandwidth wavelength-continuous by changing the routes of certain existing connections to accommodate the new connection. To avoid disruptions of existing connections, move-to-vacant wavelength-retuning (MTV WR) is proposed as the basic operation of circuit migration, in which a circuit is moved to a vacant wavelength on the same path, and the parallel MTV WR rerouting scheme is considered to reroute multiple circuits on disjoint sets of links. The authors design the optimal algorithm which minimizes the weighted number of rerouted circuits with the parallel MTV WR rerouting scheme. Numerical results using simulation show that rerouting can effectively reduce the blocking probability due to the wavelength continuity constraint while minimizing the incurred disruptions.<<ETX>>},

title={Routing for all-optical networks using wavelengths outside erbium-doped fiber amplifier bandwidth},
year={1994},
volume={},

pages={946-953 vol.2},
abstract={In wavelength-division multiplexed wide-area optical networks, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are usually employed to boost lightwave power. However, EDFAs can only cover 35 nm of the 200 nm fiber bandwidth at 1.55 /spl mu/m, and therefore messages transmitted on the remaining fiber bandwidth cannot be amplified. The authors propose to use wavelengths outside the EDFA bandwidth for sending messages over short distances in which amplification is not necessary. Routing determines which wavelength and links a message is routed on, and hence whether or not a message needs amplification. The authors design static and dynamic routing algorithms in circuit-switched networks and analyze the performance using simulation. The results show that use of wavelengths outside the EDFA bandwidth can decrease blocking and increase the network capacity.<<ETX>>},

abstract={In considering a transport layer protocol for multimedia applications in packet networks, real-time and synchronization characteristics of multimedia applications have to be considered. Synchronization means that the intermedium temporal relationship for an application has to be satisfied, after the transmission across the network. Since the random delay of packet networks makes synchronization among media more complicated, a model is required to specify the temporal relationship among media across the network which can be easily implemented in a transport protocol. In the paper, a real-time synchronization model (RTSM), is presented for synchronization, and a new protocol, namely MSTP (multimedia synchronization transport protocol), is proposed based on RTSM.<<ETX>>},

abstract={In this paper, an algorithm to determine the set of packets generated continuously and periodically from different participants that are arriving at a node either for mixing at the master of a conference, or for simply playing back at a regular participant of a conference, is proposed. The essence of the algorithm is to estimate the average packet arrival time (or reference time) for each participant. With the reference time at hand, the maximum jitter and the optimum waiting time for a mixer to wait packets from all participants can be determined. An enhancement to improve synchronization which deals with the estimation of the time offsets between the individual periods of the sources and the period of the receiver is also presented. The error of the proposed algorithm is enumerated by the Chernoff bound and is shown to be acceptable in practical application.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Cell delay variations can cause a cell stream traversing an ATM LAN to occasionally exceed a connection's negotiated peak cell rate at the entry point to an ATM WAN, resulting in undesired cell discard. The article shows through analysis and simulation that peak rate regulation enables a traffic source to maintain a desired service quality despite changes in LAN usage. This approach promises to lower an ATM WAN user's communications costs by allowing the user to pay only for actual delay variations, rather than worst case delay variations.<<ETX>>},

pages={892-901 vol.2},
abstract={The main congestion problem for LAN/MAN interconnection via ATM lies in the possibility of congestion at the receiving gateway. The authors propose a buffer management scheme that stores packets in a buffer if there is a speed mismatch between the source gateways and the receiving gateway. If congestion occurs in the source gateway, it sends a source quench message to slow down the traffic from the host. They calculate the buffer size of the receiving gateway according to the bandwidth of the virtual paths, the number of virtual paths connected, the mean packet size, and the propagation delay of the turn-off signal. Their method can reduce the processing overhead of the gateways as well as achieve real-time control.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors study the problem of interconnecting several local area networks (LAN) across a highspeed backbone network (HSN). Because of the important gap between the transmission rate of the HSN compared to the ones of the LAN, a risk of severe congestion appears at the interconnection router that feeds the destination LAN. They study this problem using simplifying assumptions that allow them to develop a simulation model in the form of a queueing system. Simulation sessions made in simple cases show that significant gains in network utilization can be achieved by use of a real-time closed-loop control between the interconnection routers, at the expense of only a little additional traffic. They conclude with remarks about implementation possibilities and possible cooperation with other algorithms.<<ETX>>},

They first underline the necessity of a peak cell rate enforcement entity at the UNI between the DQDB network and the ATM access.

abstract={Flexibility and efficiency of multipoint, multimedia communications will be greatly enhance if participants get delivery of only the streams, each at a specified level of quality, each user wishes to receive. The authors investigate the problem of optimal distribution of multiple streams from a source to a set of destinations, subject to the destinations' requirements and the limitations on available link capacities. Users' requests are expressed by means of bids, which are non-negative values assigned by each destination to each offered stream. Assuming that the source gains an amount equal to a user's bid whenever a stream is delivered to that user, we seek distributions that maximize the sources' gain. The optimal assignment of streams to the links of a multicast tree is formulated as an integer programming problem, and an algorithm for determining the optimal assignment is presented. The algorithm consists of three procedures: listing candidate assignments on a single link, listing candidate assignments on tree paths, and evaluating the gain for each assignment. The algorithm's correctness is proved, and its computational complexity is ascertained.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The article considers the multicast-to-some generalization of the traditional multicast paradigm. In this form of communication, a multicast group is still associated with each multicast message. It is, however, only necessary for any randomly determined subset of the multicast group to receive a multicast message. This subset is not defined a priori nor is it necessarily the same from one multicast to the next for the same group. It explores the use of this "probabilistic" multicast communication paradigm to address scalability issues in the response collection application which arises in some distributed computing applications. It also shows how this form of multicast can be used to reduce the discarding of responses to the multicast message due to buffer overflow at the multicast source.<<ETX>>},

pages={840-847 vol.2},
abstract={The authors study the quorumcasting problem which is a generalization of multicasting. While multicasting consists of sending a message to a select group of m nodes in a system of n nodes, quorumcasting sends a message to any q out of these m nodes. The need to communicate with an arbitrary q-subset of a predefined set arises in many distributed applications, such as distributed synchronization and updating a replicated resource. Two straightforward solutions are to send the message to individual members one at a time until q members have responded and to use multicasting to deliver the message to all members. The former solution will have excessive delay and the latter can cause congestion in nodes and/or in the network. The solutions proposed here use a minimum cost tree spanning a q-subset. By choosing an appropriate set of q nodes, the communications cost can be minimized. They present several heuristics to find low cost solutions for the quorumcast routing problem and evaluate the heuristics by comparing their solutions with exact solutions obtained from enumerating the solution space. The heuristic solutions are also compared with "random" solutions, where the q quorum sites are selected at random, and then the problem is treated like a multicast. The results of their tests show that the heuristics compare favorably with the optimal solutions, and that the random solutions perform rather poorly in comparison with the heuristics.<<ETX>>},

title={Adaptive congestion control schemes for ATM LANs},
year={1994},

pages={829-838 vol.2},
abstract={New congestion control schemes using the adaptive rate control for ATM LANs are presented. It is preferable for hosts in LANs to be able to send bursts at the same speed as the interface link speed in a lightly loaded condition, and as the network load increases, to reduce their traffic rate adaptively in order to avoid network congestion. The authors propose to apply such a rate control concept for two different traffic classes in the ATM LANs. For the first traffic class requiring no bandwidth reservation, i.e. a best effort service class, a combination of the end-to-end adaptive peak rate control with the link-by-link backpressure control is proposed. For the second traffic class, requiring the bandwidth reservation for the burst transmission, i.e. a guaranteed burst service class, a combination of the adaptive peak rate control with the fast bandwidth reservation (FRP) is proposed. It is shown through simulations that, in the first class traffic, cell loss is avoided by the backpressure, while the unfairness problems caused by the backpressure in a heavy load situation are resolved with the adaptive rate control. In the second class traffic, the network throughput characteristics are shown to be improved in the heavily loaded situations, owing to the fact that the adaptive rate control reduces the bandwidth reservation blocking probability.<<ETX>>},

year={1994},
volume={},

pages={821-828 vol.2},
abstract={ATM is a connection-oriented technology in which all communication is based on virtual connections established prior to the transfer of data. Initially, it is expected that the bulk of traffic carried by the ATM network will be data traffic. Hence, a major issue regarding ATM is the support for connectionless (datagram) traffic. A scheme for the efficient support for connectionless traffic in ATM LANs based on trees of virtual connections is proposed. In this scheme a sink tree is built for every switch in the LAN. Each tree provides an efficient means of routing connectionless traffic from any switch in the network to the sink switch (root) of the tree. The sink tree solution may also be used to broadcast connectionless messages in the reverse direction. The trees can easily be updated to adapt to topological changes or congestion in the network. A protocol for refreshing the tree structure using the ATM switch routing tables is described.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors investigate burst-level bandwidth reservation schemes in ATM LANs and compare the performance of REQ/ACK and on-the-fly reservation schemes for a client-server model with a single ATM switch. To compare performance, they derive an analytical model for the mean burst transfer delay, blocking probability and throughput. They discuss the dependence of these performance parameters on the propagation delay-to-burst duration ratio and peak rate-to-link speed ratio. They show that, for moderate propagation delay-to-burst duration ratio, the on-the-fly scheme is more desirable since the REQ/ACK scheme has limited achievable throughput for fast reservation traffic due to unused bandwidth during the REQ-ACK cycle. Also, for a given burst length (in bits), the delay performance of REQ/ACK scheme is more sensitive to increase in the peak rate than the on-the-fly scheme.<<ETX>>},

pages={802-811 vol.2},
abstract={This work presents a coherent system solution for combining with no loss due to congestion, on one hand, bursty traffic with unpredictable pattern in time and space, and on the other hand, periodic real-time or connection-oriented traffic with bandwidth guaranteed requirements over fixed routes. This solution facilitates the implementation of a scalable high performance multimedia system for distributed/parallel computing with real-time interactive voice and video. The MetaNet real-time traffic has the following attributes: (1) guaranteed bandwidth with bounded delay, (2) fixed jitter-independent of the network size, (3) no loss due to congestion inside the network, (4) fixed path routing with FIFO order, and (5) support of complex periodicity scheduling. At the same time, the underlying MetaNet asynchronous (bursty) traffic properties (provided by previous works) remain unchanged. Namely, any node can try to transmit asynchronously (bursty traffic), without reservation as much as it can, and the network access and flow control ensure the following traditional LAN properties: (6) no loss with a single input buffer, (7) fair and deadlock-free access, and (8) self-routing with broadcast. The self-routing on the MetaNet is a variant of deflection routing. It makes on-line routing decisions based on the local flow of traffic (load conditions). Unlike other deflection techniques, the MetaNet routing is along a global sense of direction, which guarantees that cells will reach their destinations. Thus, this method is called convergence routing.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Multiprotocol systems are a vital tool for achieving interoperability in today's heterogeneous communication networks. An important aspect of these systems is the need to determine which of the multiple available protocols will be used to carry out a given communication task; an uninformed choice can result in failure to communicate when communication should be possible. The authors consider ways to make information about hosts' supported protocol configurations available through directory services. They discuss various representation approaches, and describe a working implementation of a multiprotocol application exemplifying their approach.<<ETX>>},

pages={776-783 vol.2},
abstract={Many important protocols in distributed computing have simple and elegant solutions if one allows the assumption of unbounded size registers. This assumption can be simulated in practice using sufficiently large but bounded registers; however the resulting protocols are extremely vulnerable to transient faults. The authors present a general methodology for the transformation of unbounded register protocols so that they can work with bounded registers in a self-stabilizing fashion. The applicability of this method is demonstrated with two examples: spanning tree computation and topology update.<<ETX>>},

abstract={It is shown in this paper that the problem of deciding if a test suite generated from a finite state machine provides complete fault coverage can be converted into the problem of minimizing the test tree representing the test suite. A fault coverage analysis procedure, capable of deciding if a given test suite provides complete fault coverage in respect to a given FSM specification, is then developed. The core of this procedure is a state minimization procedure developed specifically for the class of FSMs whose graphic representations are trees. The fault coverage analysis procedure can cope with partially specified FSM specifications which need not be reduced and faults that increase the number of states up to a chosen upper bound. Two necessary and one sufficient conditions, which in some cases may simplify the fault coverage analysis, are also presented.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Slot reuse is a simple method to improve the efficiency of MACs designed for the slotted, dual bus configuration. The authors propose several schemes for the assignment of throughput to stations in this configuration, taking into account slot reuse and assuming uniform traffic. The criteria for comparison of the schemes are throughput gain, worst message queueing and access delays at stations and the fraction of blocked messages. It turns out that the throughput gain in the scheme in which every station receives the same throughput is relatively low but it is the most attractive scheme is relation to the other criteria.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The no slot wasting immediately using the TAR bit (NSW IUT) bandwidth balancing mechanism has been previously proposed for dual bus architectures. NSW IUT is a variation of the no slot wasting bandwidth balancing (NSW BWB) mechanism and it can also introduce bandwidth fairness into a DQDB network without wasting channel slots. In addition, it enables lightly loaded stations to use more effectively the TAR=1 bits they observe and improve considerably their delay performance. In the paper, the authors use simulation to carry out a thorough investigation of the delay performance of the NSW IUT mechanism under single and multiple priority classes of traffic as well as under the presence of erasure nodes. Throughout the study, they also compare NSW IUT with NSW BWB as well as with the bandwidth balancing of the IEEE 802.6 standard.<<ETX>>},

The authors use simulation results to investigate the delay performance of the proposed priority mechanism in the case of three classes of traffic. Furthermore, they compare its performance with the corresponding performance of other (previously proposed) priority mechanisms.

pages={726-733 vol.2},
abstract={Cell loss is an inherent problem of ATM networks. The magnitude of the service degradation caused by cell loss depends on the application and loss distribution. This paper introduces a new performance criterion, called effective loss, which can quantitatively measure this degradation. Effective loss is particularly suitable for block-oriented transmissions, such as file transfer applications, but can also be applied to a broad range of other applications. In this paper the effective loss measure is applied to the study of the effectiveness of bandwidth reservation mechanisms in an ATM multiplexer. Numerical results demonstrate circumstances under which bandwidth reservation improves performance as well as circumstances in which it degrades performance.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors are concerned with the allocation of the available capacity of a statistical multiplexer to serve a number of heterogeneous on-off sources, with the cell loss rate as the performance criterion. In order to avoid using potentially lengthy simulations, they have derived computationally efficient bounds and asymptotic approximations for the cell loss rate. The union of all partitions of the available capacity which satisfies the capacity bound and the performance criterion is defined as the capacity region. Both linear approximation and nonlinear approximation of the capacity region are investigated. It is shown that the linear approximation is reasonably accurate when the activity factors of the sources are not too high (less than 0.8). For the case where the linear approximation appears too optimistic, a simple nonlinear approximation for determining the capacity region is suggested. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated using numerical examples.<<ETX>>},

volume={},
number={},
pages={698-707 vol.2},
abstract={Most of the solutions proposed to support real-time (i.e. guaranteed performance) communication services in packet-switching networks adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. In such an approach, resource allocation and route selection decisions are made before the start of the communication on the basis of resource availability and real-time network load at that time, and are usually kept for the duration of the communication. This rather static resource management approach has certain limitations: it does not take into account (a) the dynamicity of the communicating clients; (b) the dynamicity of the network state; and (c) the tradeoff between quality of service and network availability, thus affecting the availability and flexibility of the real-time network services. Availability is the ability of the network to accommodate as many real-time clients as possible, while flexibility is the ability to adapt the real-time services to changing network state and client demands. The authors present the dynamic connection management (DCM) scheme, which addresses these issues by providing the network with the capability to dynamically modify the performance parameters and the routes of any existing real-time connection. With these capabilities, DCM can be used to increase the availability and flexibility of the guaranteed performance service offered to the clients.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Successful exploitation of prioritized ATM networks requires matching the characteristics of the coded source with the unique properties of the network. This is particularly true for video which is very bandwidth intensive. The authors describe and investigate the performance of three prioritization schemes in terms of the traffic characteristics, SNR, and visual quality. These schemes are further designed such that the high priority data stream is MPEG-I compliant and only a single pass through the encoder is required. A technique for choosing parameter values which achieve a specified high priority traffic bandwidth is presented for two of these schemes. The technique is demonstrated to be remarkably accurate for different video sequences.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Recent interest in supporting packet-audio applications over wide area networks has been fueled by the availability of low-cost, toll-quality workstation audio and the demonstration that limited amounts of interactive audio can be supported by today's Internet. In such applications, received audio packets are buffered, and their playout delayed at the destination host in order to compensate for the variable network delays. The authors investigate the performance of four different algorithms for adaptively adjusting the playout delay of audio packets in an interactive packet-audio terminal application, in the face of such varying network delays. They evaluate the playout algorithms using experimentally-obtained delay measurements of audio traffic between several different Internet sites. Their results indicate that an adaptive algorithm which explicitly adjusts to the sharp, spike-like increases in packet delay which were observed in the traces can achieve a lower rate of lost packets for both a given average playout delay and a given maximum buffer size.<<ETX>>},

Such a system uses a multiresolution image coding scheme so that a user accessing the database will first see a coarse version of the images and will be able to accept or discard a given image faster, without needing to receive all the image data. The authors formalize the problem of choosing the bit allocation (e.g., in the two resolution case, how many bits should be given to the coarse image and the additional information, respectively?) so that the overall delay in the query is minimized. They provide analytical methods to find the optimal solution under different configurations and show how a good choice of the bit allocation results in a significant reduction of the overall delay in the query (by up to a factor of two in some cases).<<ETX>>},

abstract={Traffic from video services is expected to be a substantial portion of the traffic carried by emerging broadband integrated networks. For variable bit rate (VBR) coded video, statistical source models are needed to design networks that achieve acceptable picture quality at minimum cost, and to design traffic shaping and control mechanisms. For video teleconference traffic, the authors have previously shown that traffic is sufficiently accurately characterized by a multi-state Markov chain model that can be derived from three traffic parameters (mean, correlation, and variance). In the present paper, they describe modeling results for sequences with frequent scene changes (the previously studied video teleconferences have very little scene variation) such as entertainment television, news, and sports broadcasts. They analyze eleven long sequences of broadcast video traffic data. Unlike video teleconferences, the different sequences studied have different details regarding distributions of cells per frame. The authors present source models applicable to the different sequences and evaluate their accuracy as predictors of cell losses in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A service discipline for the link transmission scheduling in a virtual circuit network with arbitrary topology is proposed. The scheduling of each link is based on the traffic at its origin node only. It is performed in two levels operating in different time scales. In the slower time scale the fraction of the link capacity to be allocated to the different streams is updated such that it remains proportional to the traffic of each stream that has arrived at the origin node of the link. In the faster time scale the link capacity is shared, such that the fractions of the capacity allocated by the bandwidth allocation policy are honored. A fluid traffic model is considered and processor sharing service is assumed. The policy is analyzed and it is shown that the existence of rates of the arrival streams guarantees that the allocated bandwidth at each stream will converge to a value larger than the link load. When the arrival streams are regulated to satisfy certain burstiness constraints, then the backlog at each network node is bounded as well.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new approach to congestion management is explored. A traffic process is supposed to be passing through an infinite server queue. The resulting queueing process happens to follow or to track the periods of time during which the "congestion" is being built into the system, giving as a result a real time picture of the congestion introduced by this particular traffic process. This picture, called the congestion process, can be used to throttle the amount of "congestion" introduced to the ATM network, as well as to seize the on-line network resources necessary to guarantee a particular quality of service. Special emphasis is given to applications in ATM B-ISDN with deterministic service queues. Using the congestion process concept, a policing application is discussed as well as some ideas regarding the ATM bandwidth management problem.<<ETX>>},

They first examine the GPS and PGPS servers in isolation, and demonstrate their superiority to a general server in the stochastic environment. They then show that a network of servers, that are all either GPS or PGPS, is stable whenever the service rate of each node is larger than the total arrival rate to it. In addition, they provide exponential upper bounds to the traffic flows within the network links, and to the backlogs of each session in the various nodes on its path.<<ETX>>},

pages={610-617 vol.2},
abstract={Analyzes the throughput of a centralized packet receiver which utilizes multiuser detection in an unslotted contention channel. The receiver is capable of demodulating all overlapping, unit-length packets, provided that the T-length packet headers do not overlap, and at most K packets overlap at any one time. If one of these conditions is violated, the remainder of the busy period is assumed to be unresolvable. Assuming that the aggregate packet arrival process is Poisson, the authors analyze the throughput as a function of the total offered load (/spl lambda/), the maximum number of resolvable overlapping packets (K), and the fractional header duration (T). They derive an iterative expression for the throughput for K=2 or 3, generalizable to larger K, which permits solution of the throughput to arbitrary accuracy. A closed form solution is given for the case K=2 and T=0.5. The authors provide bounds on the throughput for arbitrary K, /spl lambda/, and T, which are more convenient than the exact approach for T>0 or large K. Numerical results illustrate the improvement in throughput due to multiuser detection, and suggest a technique for finding the minimum complexity multiuser receiver (minimum K) as a function of other system parameters.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors examine the performance implications of providing reliability in conjunction with multicast transport over a high speed wide area network. They use a block based acknowledgement and selective retransmission protocol to evaluate the impact of the loss rate and the multicast tree topology on the achievable throughput. Their results show that even when the buffer overflow probability at switches and receivers is low, the cumulative loss probability seen by a source may be quite high. They also demonstrate that the average throughput increases significantly if the transport protocol delivers packets to the application layer out-of-sequence. They investigate the scaling properties of the error control mechanism and show that the multicast tree topology that results in minimum transfer time is not necessarily the same as the one constructed using minimal bandwidth or shortest path algorithms.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Considers a problem of network design of personal communication services (PCS). The problem is to assign cells to the switches of a PCS network in an optimum manner. The authors consider two types of costs. One is the cost of handoffs between cells. The other is the cost of cabling (or trunking) between a cell site and its associated switch. The problem is constrained by the call volume that each switch can handle. They formulate the problem exactly as an integer programming problem. They also propose three heuristic solutions for this problem and show that two of them perform extremely well.<<ETX>>},

year={1994},

pages={585-592 vol.2},
abstract={In a personal communication services (PCS) network, a set of channels is assigned to every cell. When a phone call arrives, it consumes a channel until the end of the conversation. If no channel is available, the call is dropped. In many cases, channels may return shortly after a call is dropped. Thus, if some buffering mechanism is introduced to the channel allocation algorithm, a cell may accommodate more phone calls. This is referred to as call request buffering. The paper proposes both analytical and simulation models to study the impact of two call request buffering schemes. The results indicate the potential to greatly improve network performance (i.e., reducing the call blocking probability) by increasing the call-setup period by a reasonably small amount. For the offered load engineered at 1% blocking probability, call request buffering carries 5%-50% more load compared with the system without buffering.<<ETX>>},

pages={577-584 vol.2},
abstract={In personal communications applications, users communicate via wireless with a wireline network. The wireline network tracks the current location of the user, and can therefore route messages to a user regardless of the user's location. In addition to its impact on signaling within the wireline network, mobility tracking requires the expenditure of wireless resources as well, including the power consumption of the portable units carried by the users and the radio bandwidth used for registration and paging. Ideally, the mobility tracking scheme used for each user should depend on the user's call and mobility pattern, so that the current registration area approach (which ignores such information) may be wasteful of wireless resources under certain circumstances. In the paper, the authors provide a model and an optimization algorithm based on dynamic programming for choosing the mobility tracking scheme on a per-user basis. While illustrative results are provided for a simple one-dimensional mobility model, the approach is shown to be applicable to a very general class of problems.<<ETX>>},

In order to save the cost of using the wireless links mobile users should not update their location whenever they cross boundaries of adjacent cells. The paper focuses on three natural strategies in which the mobile users make the decisions when and where to update: the time-based strategy, the number of movements-based strategy, and the distance-based strategy. The authors consider both memoryless movement patterns and movements with Markovian memory along a topology of cells arranged as a ring. They analyze the performance of each one of the three strategies under such movements, and show the performance differences between the strategies.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Single-hop and multi-hop wavelength division multiplex (WDM) access systems have been proposed to take advantage of the large bandwidth available in lightwave mediums. In such systems, there are one or several transmitters and receivers at each node in the network. The receivers and transmitters may be tunable or set at particular wavelengths. The lightwave medium makes available a large number of channels at different wavelengths. Recently, the stochastic analysis of single-hop and multi-hop systems has been studied. The authors present a unified 'multi-facility blocking model' approach to the stochastic modeling and analysis of WDM networks of both the single-hop and multi-hop type. The developed model is amenable to exact analysis by an efficient recursive algorithm. The modeling and analysis technique enables one to study the performance of arbitrary access configurations under general traffic conditions including the case of uniform traffic and the case where there are 'hot spots.'.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Although WDM-based single-hop star networks are attractive owing to their all-optical communication features, the throughput of such lightwave networks is limited due to the small number of available wavelengths. In this paper, a wavelength-reusable local lightwave network which consists of interconnected WDM star networks is proposed. Based on this architecture, the lower bound for the problems of minimizing the switching duration is derived. A transmission scheduling algorithm for this architecture to efficiently reuse the wavelengths is also proposed. The analytical result shows that the proposed scheduling algorithm always produces solutions no greater than twice of the lower bounds. Simulation results show that given the same number of users and available wavelengths, the solutions (in terms of the average switching duration and the average number of switching matrices) obtained by the proposed scheduling algorithm on the interconnected WDM networks are better than the optimal solution on a single-star WDM network. In most cases, the performance improvement achieves 20% to 45%.<<ETX>>},

pages={534-543 vol.2},
abstract={The authors present a heuristic algorithm for effectively assigning a limited number of wavelengths among the access stations of a multihop network wherein the physical medium consists of optical fiber segments which interconnect wavelength-selective optical switches. Such a physical medium permits the limited number of wavelengths to be re-used among the various fiber links, thereby offering very high aggregate capacity. Although the optical connectivity among the access station can be altered by changing the states of the various optical switches, the resulting optical connectivity pattern is constrained by the limitation imposed at the physical level. They also present and study two admission control schemes, used to admit or reject requests for virtual connections. The heuristic is tested on a realistic traffic model, and the call blocking performance of new requests for virtual connections is studied through extensive simulations and compared against the blocking performance of an ideal infinite capacity centralized switch (lowest possible call blocking caused exclusively by congestion on the finite capacity user input/output links, never by the switch fabric itself). Surprisingly, they find that, for a wide range of parameters, the blocking performance of the lightwave network is almost the same as that of the ideal centralized switch. From these results, they conclude that the heuristic algorithm is effective and the admission control scheme is efficient.<<ETX>>},

The authors address the problem of characterizing and designing scheduling policies that are optimal in the sense of minimizing buffer and/or delay requirements under the assumption of commonly accepted traffic constraints. They investigate the buffer requirements under three typical memory allocation mechanisms, that represent trade-offs between efficiency and complexity. For classes with delay constraints they provide policies that are optimal in the sense of satisfying the constraints if they are satisfiable by any policy, and they also have low buffer requirements. They also address the issue of designing policies that satisfy delay constraints in a fair manner. They mainly concern ourselves with non-preemptive policies. One of the proposed policies is based on a class of non-preemptive policies that tracks preemptive policies. This class is introduced in this paper and may be of interest in other applications as well.<<ETX>>},

When congestion occurs at a queue lower priority cells can be discarded in order to insure a smaller cell loss rate for higher priority cells.

abstract={The proposed implementation of two QOS bearer services in ATM networks has generated considerable work on the analysis of implicit policy assignment space priority control buffer access schemes. Recently, there have been more interest directed towards explicit policy assignment space priority schemes because of their increased efficiency and flexibility over implicit assignment schemes. The paper considers an explicit policy assignment space priority control scheme employing the push-out buffer access mechanism. Cell loss probabilities are derived for a traffic model consisting of two service classes. Each service class consists of bursty traffic generated by a multiple number of three-state discrete-time Markov sources. The effect of cell loss probabilities on traffic load and burstiness characteristics, as well as buffer size, is examined. The authors have previously analyzed the performance of an explicit policy assignment partial buffer sharing scheme for the same traffic model. Performance comparisons between the push-out and partial buffer sharing schemes are also made in the present paper.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Studies a single server queueing system with deterministic service time in which arrivals are regulated by the leaky-bucket control. The worst traffic of arrivals passing the leaky-bucket regulation is discussed. The performance measure considered is queueing delay averaged over all packets. The worst traffic is characterized as the repetition of the following three phases: bulky arrival with bulk size related to the bucket size, arrival at every token generation for a specified length of interval, and then no arrival till the token bucket is full. The average queueing delay for the worst traffic, i.e. tight performance bound, is expressed in explicit form as a function of leaky bucket parameters (bucket size and token generation rate). The authors expect that this function will provide insights into the relationship between leaky bucket parameters and the corresponding network resources allocated.<<ETX>>},

This system is compared to a simulation of a non-blocking switch implementing a similar gated strategy. Results indicate that this method yields tight bounds for small networks with arbitrary input distributions and switch routing probabilities.

abstract={Through rigorous formalization of basic notions about interconnection networks, new and old constructions of interconnection networks are naturally organized into a systematic account. Meanwhile, generally known but vague facts about the theoretical properties of routing networks are stated precisely. "Reversible routing networks" form the basis of a class of output-buffer self-route ATM switches. Such networks can be used in error-correcting routing, and some are better choices over others in terms of the modularity of exchange patterns between stages of routing cells. The "Rotary switch" is designed over any reversible routing network. It corrects a misstep in routing without necessarily an exact reversion. This allows multiple paths for a deflected packet to proceed on and thereby reduces the probability of collision. Simulations have shown low packet loss rate vs. either the number of switching stages or the size of output multiplexers.<<ETX>>},

abstract={This paper shows how to design an ATM network, for real-time traffic, such that under full network load (i) the maximum delay of a low-rate voice connection is minimized, (ii) the delay uncertainty or jitter is a fixed network parameter, and (iii) the required buffer sizes (inside the network) to ensure loss-free routing is minimized. In addition, this design does not exclude the integration of other classes of traffic, such as connectionless, which have lower priority. The isochronous timing information is used only for regulating and pacing the traffic forwarded inside the network rather than for routing as in traditional circuit switching networks. This means that an ATM cell is sent from one switch to another not at a very specific time but within a time frame of a relatively long duration as compared to the cell transmission time. The routing of cells of each connection is based on VCI and VPI, and as a result, timing errors do not affect the ATM routing. Analytical and simulation results are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of this switching approach.<<ETX>>},
