abstract={There has been a great technological advancement in microelectronics and communications, which forces, among others, investigations on ATM switching architectures. Researchers keep on searching an efficient architecture, able to perform at a wide range of traffic loads and patterns, ensuring both minimum probability of cell loss as well as minimum cell delay. The authors propose one more architecture. The main goal is to create an architecture capable of operating at very high data rates. As the result, the switch uses the fastest method of buffer management, and is characterized by sufficiently low probability of blocking and short delay time. Appropriate simulation results are presented and some implementation issues are discussed.},

volume={1},

pages={8-15 vol.1},
abstract={Uniform traffic does not represent a realistic view of traffic patterns in real systems. Non-uniform traffic models better reflect the traffic patterns that need to be accommodated. Such traffic may cause the network performance to deteriorate to much lower levels than the ones predicted by uniform traffic analysis. The authors extend the queueing analysis for buffered networks by providing methods for analyzing the queueing behavior of switching networks under non-uniform traffic patterns. They focus on shared buffer switch elements because they have better performance than input or output buffered elements. The analytical method for performance evaluation is compared with simulation on the basis of accuracy, where the performance is measured in terms of maximum throughput and probability of cell loss.},

abstract={A new and accurate Markov chain model for evaluating the performance of multistage ATM switching fabrics with 2/spl times/2 finite output-buffered switching elements is proposed. By comparing the results obtained from the proposed model, existing models, and simulations, it has been shown that the proposed model is much more accurate than existing models in the presence of a non-uniform traffic in the switch. The results from existing models are unsatisfactory in the presence of an increased blocking in the switch arising due to a non-uniform traffic in the switch. On the contrary, the proposed model is very robust even under severe blocking inside the switch.},

pages={24-31 vol.1},
abstract={Addresses the problem of designing optimal buffer management policies in shared memory switches when packets already accepted in the switch can be dropped (pushed-out). The goal is to maximize the overall throughput, or equivalently to minimize the overall loss probability in the system. For a system with two output ports, the authors prove that the optimal policy is of pushout with threshold type (POT). The same result holds if the optimality criterion is the weighted sum of the port loss probabilities. For this system, the authors also give an approximate method for the calculation of the optimal threshold, which they conjecture to be asymptotically correct. For the N-ported system, the optimal policy is not known in general, but it is shown that for a symmetric system (equal traffic on all ports) it consists of always accepting arrivals when the buffer is not full, and dropping one from the longest queue to accommodate the new arrival when the buffer is full. Numerical investigations show that under the optimal POT policy the loss probability of a port is insensitive to traffic fluctuations in the other port.},

abstract={When multiple systems are interconnected through a high-speed backbone network and communicate without resource reservation, under certain conditions a severe overload can appear at the destination system. This problem, called the converging flows problem, can be alleviated by use of a feedback control mechanism that coordinates the emission of the sources. The authors present a dynamic resource management mechanism that both controls the losses at the congested node and attempts to optimize resource utilization. In fact it steers the entire system into a desirable operating regime. They study analytically the behavior of the system under such a control and show that it can be reduced with a few approximations to a well-known physical system. This allows to infer optimal values for the parameters of the command algorithm, and the authors show that these values have a natural physical meaning to the system.},

pages={40-48 vol.1},
abstract={A credit-based controller (CBC), which has a provision for cell tagging, is proposed for usage parameter control (UPC). Similar in concept to the leaky bucket, the CBC has a credit counter and a data buffer. Credits are accumulated at a rate initiated from the network (equivalent to the sustainable cell rate), and depleted at a rate pertaining to the network traffic load. A source has the prerogative whether or not to send its cells as tagged cells when the credit level is nonpositive. The queueing behavior of the CBC fed by a Marcov modulated source, is analyzed using a stochastic fluid flow model. It is shown that the performance of the CBC can be altered by tuning the weighting parameter within the CBC. Also, adjustments can be made to balance the ratio of tagged and untagged cells sent into the network.},

year={1995},

pages={56-63 vol.1},
abstract={The control of source-coded traffic at a multiplexer has been a topic of extensive research. Traditional approaches typically use feedback information on the buffer level in designing the control policy. While important, buffer levels capture only part of the information about the overall system state. By setting up this problem as a Markov decision process, the authors show that using information on the state (activity) of the sources, in addition to the buffer level, can result in significant improvements over traditional approaches. They demonstrate this for a multiplexer fed by /spl mu/-law encoded voice sources. Some of the scenarios studied exhibit a reduction in distortion exceeding 35%. In general, the improvement is heavily dependent on the correlation statistics of the sources. Emulations validate the analysis. The form and characteristics of the optimal control policies are also discussed.},

abstract={Continually growing number of users have to exchange increasing amounts of information. Local area networks (LANs) are commonly used as the communication infrastructure that meets the demands of the users in the local environment. These networks typically consist of several LAN segments connected together via bridges. The authors describe an algorithm for designing LANs with the objective of minimizing the average network delay. The topology design includes issues such as determination of the number of segments in the network, allocating the users to the different segments and determining the interconnections and routing among the segments. The determination of the optimal LAN topology is a complicated combinatorial optimisation problem. Therefore, a heuristic algorithm which is based on genetic ideas is used. Numerical examples are provided and the quality of the designs obtained by using the algorithm is compared with lower bounds on the average network delay that are developed.},

abstract={Next generation wide area networks will be connection-oriented, with data-link layer connectivity being provided by asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). For the huge existing investment in current IP networks such as the Internet to remain useful, one must devise mechanisms to carry IP traffic over ATM networks. A fundamental issue is to devise holding policies for virtual circuits carrying datagrams. The authors consider two pricing schemes, the first is a likely pricing scheme of future ATM networks, while the second is based on characteristics of current networks. For each pricing scheme, the authors devise a simple holding policy that adapts to the characteristics of the IP traffic. The authors simulate their policies on actual network traffic and find that they perform significantly better than previous policies.},

abstract={The paper presents a new design methodology and tools to construct a switch-based LAN with (i) scalable throughput, (ii) no loss due to congestion, and (iii) two routing modes: FIFO or non-FIFO. More specifically, given a bounded degree (number of switch ports) at each node, the design is based on the construction of multiple virtual rings under the following constraints: (i) the virtual rings are pairwise edge-disjoint, and (ii) there is at least one virtual ring between any pair of nodes. The target topology is obtained from the edge union of the multiple virtual rings. The objectives of the above two constraints are (i) to ensure no loss due to congestion inside the network of bursty traffic sources, and (ii) to ensure convergence of packets/cells to their destinations. The virtual rings are constructed by a new methodology that employs combinatorial block designs together with a new algorithm for realizing any size networks. It is shown that the bound on the maximum route length, under the two constraints, is O(/spl radic/N) for an N-node network.},

abstract={Considers the problem of optimal scheduling of soft handoffs as applicable to DS/CDMA based cellular networks. The authors have formulated the phenomenon of soft handoffs as a reward/cost stochastic optimization problem wherein the reward is a function of some measurable characteristics of the received signal, and cost can be associated with different factors such as multiple simultaneous active connections, connection set-up and termination overheads. Using dynamic programming, a maximum net reward policy that specifies the optimal base stations the mobile should be associated with during each time slot, is determined. The authors also extend their results to the case when there are more than two base stations. Furthermore, the decisions are taken in a decentralized online manner. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms offer considerable improvement over the policy proposed in the IS-95 standard.},

A common communication channel is to be dynamically shared between the cells. The authors propose a distributed inter-cell channel allocation policy that is easy to implement through the use of simple signalling between neighboring cells. For cells arranged in a line they show that the proposed policy achieves maximum throughput. The same is true when the cells are arranged in a circle and the channel can be reused in every other cell. For larger reuse distances and planar hexagonal arrays, the policy may not always achieve maximal throughput. For these cases the authors provide regions of achievable cell throughputs under the proposed policy and show that they are tight in certain cases.},

We provide a lower bound to the completion time of any off-line schedule with an arbitrary number of wavelengths. We then describe a near-optimal schedule which is based on the principle of having idle transmitters tune to wavelengths just-in-time to start their transmissions. Stability and capacity issues in the transmission of real-time traffic are considered. We show that the scheduling problem admits a single stable equilibrium point, and point out how the traffic capacity of a broadcast network can be reached.

abstract={Optical networks can provide higher throughputs while high speed electronic networks possess the intelligence for network control and management. We present a two level high speed network architecture that combines the throughput advantage of optical networks and the intelligence of electronic processing. One level is a high speed mesh LAN which uses wormhole routing, source routing and hop-by-hop flow control mechanisms with mesh routers (asynchronous pipelined crossbar switches) to provide a high speed electronic network. The second level is an optical star network interconnecting high speed mesh networks distributed across metropolitan area distances. We obtain analytical expressions for the average message (worm) delays for the GTDM (group time division multiplexing) multi-access protocol (which includes as special cases TDM and DAS) for single-hop packet switching in the optical network of such an architecture. We use a two state discrete time Markov chain to model the arrival of messages to the optical network. Results for both uniform traffic and non-uniform traffic are presented. Finally, a modified dynamic allocation scheme is presented for single-hop packet switching which handles the message as a unit rather than sending a message as several fixed sized packets.},

abstract={A new distributed global queueing strategy and medium access protocol that users employ to schedule their transmissions to avoid receiver collisions is introduced for an optical fiber network. The network uses wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) for the data channels. The medium access control utilizes TDMA on the control channel to allow users to implement a global reservation scheme to send data packets. The data channels operate under a distributed demand assignment scheme that allows receiver collision-free operation and efficient scheduling. An analytical solution is obtained via equilibrium point analysis (EPA). It was shown that the maximum throughput obtained is approximately 42% which exceeds the maximum throughput of ALOHA based medium access protocols. The delay is shown to be relatively constant for a wide range of operation.},

abstract={Traffic streams-originally shaped to comply with desired traffic descriptors-may suffer substantial distortion within an ATM network due to statistical multiplexing. As a consequence, traffic re-shaping within the network may be necessary. In this work the modification of a tagged traffic stream due to a series of multiplexing operations is studied. The standard FCFS service policy, as well as a peak-rate enforcing multiplexing discipline, are considered. Tagged cell delay, jitter and inter-departure processes are considered for the characterization of the tagged traffic stream.},

abstract={In this paper, we provide: (a) An efficient method for simplifying MMPP source models, which can be used to solve multi-media queueing problems with complicated aggregate input traffic. The effectiveness of the method is verified through numerical examples. (b) An approximation algorithm for analyzing multi-link queueing networks with MMPP traffic sources and arbitrary configurations. In this algorithm, a queueing network is analyzed by decomposing it into individual queues, each with an arrival rate appropriately reduced by the packet dropping occurred in other queues. Each queue is then solved individually by using the simplified source models of (a) while the interdependencies with the other queues are accounted for through this reduced-load approximation. Any desirable end-to-end performance measure characterizing the quality of service (QOS) of the multi-media traffic can be calculated in this manner. The results obtained by the algorithm have been compared with simulation results, and the observed relative error is satisfactory.},

abstract={We present the design of a high performance ATM host-network interface for multimedia workstations and servers. At Washington University, as part of an ARPA-sponsored gigabit local ATM testbed, we are building a prototype of this interface that can support a sustained aggregate bidirectional data rate of 2.4 Gbps. The centerpiece of our interface design is a custom chip called the APIC (ATM port interconnect controller). Multiple such chips can be interconnected to yield a desk-area network (DAN) which would serve as a high speed I/O interconnect for the host computer. This paper details the internal design of the APIC chip, and outlines some of its key features. Noteworthy among these are: connection caching, transmit pacing, cell batching, remote control, and support for AAL-0, AAL-5, multipoint, and loopback connections. We have chosen to defer to a later paper the details pertaining to several other features which provide support for zero-copy, improved interrupt handling, direct control of the chip from user-space, and efficient buffering and demultiplexing.},

pages={188-196 vol.1},
abstract={Shaping of traffic at its source is a prominent congestion control solution in ATM networks. The "leaky bucket" with a "cell spacer" is a very popular traffic shaping approach. By sizing the leaky bucket and spacer parameters, an end-station shapes its traffic to conform to a "good behavior" contract with the network. The leaky bucket delays the transmission of selected number of cells, while the spacer forces a minimum time-distance between transmitted cells. When a contracted transmission rate is close to the traffic generation rate by the end-station, this traffic stream will utilize most of the bandwidth available on its virtual connection. The high utilization of such a connection leads to large queues of frames and cells at the end-station, With high adverse consequences to the end-to-end delay and jitter. In this paper, based on the negotiated traffic parameters and source traffic characteristics, we study, through simulations, the contribution of the leaky bucket plus cell spacer subsystem to the delay and jitter in an end-station. We also study the distribution of the size of the burst of cells leaving the end-station and entering the network. Finally, we derive the theoretical upper bound for the size of bursts of cells.},

abstract={In this paper, we refine the calculus proposed previously by Chang et al. (1994). The new calculus, including network operations for multiplexing, input-output relation, and routing, allows us to compute tighter exponential bounds for the tail distributions of queue lengths in intree networks with routing. In particular, if external arrival processes and routing processes are either Markov arrival processes or autoregressive processes, the stationary queue length at a local node is stochastically bounded above by the sum of a constant and an Erlang random variable. The decay rate of the Erlang random variable is not greater than (in some cases equal to) the decay rate of the tail distribution of the stationary queue length. The number of stages of the Erlang random variable is the number of external arrival processes and routing processes contributing to its queue length. For the single queue case, both the lower and upper-bounds are derived.},

abstract={One of important properties of a multihop network is the mean internodal distance for evaluating transmission delay. The connective semi-random network achieves a smaller mean internodal distance than other networks. However, the results have only been obtained by computer simulation and no theoretical analysis has been performed. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the mean internodal distance of a connective semi-random network. Moreover, we also theoretically analyze a restricted connective semi-random network whose network connective probability is larger than that of a conventional connective semi-random network. It is shown that the theoretical analyzed results agree well with the simulated results in a conventional model and our model with small restriction. The influence of restriction on the mean internodal distance becomes small as the number of outgoing links per node becomes large.},

abstract={The paper focuses on the dynamic resource allocation problem. In communication networks such as wireless or circuit switching networks, resources correspond to base stations or links, and the load corresponds to the calls in the network. The principle of load balancing is examined for dynamic resource allocation. The question of interest is the performance of simple allocation strategies which can be implemented online. Either finite capacity constraints on resources or mobility of users can be incorporated into the setup. The load balancing problem is formulated as an optimal control problem, and variants of a simple "least loaded routing" policy are shown to be asymptotically optimal for large call arrival rates.},

pages={239-252 vol.1},
abstract={In credit-based flow control for ATM networks, a buffer is first allocated to each VC (virtual circuit) and then credit control is applied to the VC for avoiding possible buffer overflow. Receiver-oriented, adaptive buffer allocation allows a receiver to allocate its buffer dynamically, to VCs from multiple upstream nodes based on their bandwidth usage. The paper describes, in detail, such an adaptive algorithm capable of supporting a wide range of link speeds and propagation delays, and also packing multiple allocation and credit records in a single message. Analysis and simulation results show that even under highly bursty traffic, the adaptive scheme guarantees no cell loss due to congestion, and achieves excellent performance in utilization, fairness, ramp-up and packing, while requiring only relatively small node memory and bandwidth overhead. The required memory need only be 4*RTT+2*N, where RTT is the link round-trip time in cell cycles and N is the number of VCs.},

Although existing protocols provide efficient error control over conventional networks, wireless networks present significant new challenges. The radio link introduces noise and multipath interference causing long periods of increased error rate, while host motion requires changing communication paths that can cause packet delay, misordering, duplication, and loss. Furthermore, scarce radio resources make bandwidth efficiency desirable. Using measurements from a field-deployed PCS system in Boulder Colorado, the authors identify two types of reception area. They highlight the benefits of powerful error control mechanisms in the fringe reception areas, especially selective acknowledgments and combining data from multiple transmissions.},

abstract={Derives a time complexity bound for the gradient projection method for optimal routing in data networks. This result shows that the gradient projection algorithm of the Goldstein-Levitin-Poljak type formulated by Bertsekas (1982) converges to within /spl epsiv/ in relative accuracy in O(/spl epsiv//sup 2/h/sub min/N/sub max//sup L/) iterations, where N/sub max//sup L/ is the number of paths sharing the maximally shared link, and h/sub min/ is the diameter of the network. Based on this complexity result, the authors also show that the one-source-at-a-time update policy has a complexity bound which is O(n) times smaller than that of the all-at-a-time update policy [Bertsekas, 1982], where n is the number of nodes in the network. The result of the paper argues for constructing networks with low diameter for the purpose of reducing the complexity of the network control algorithms. The result also implies that parallelizing the optimal rotating algorithm over the network nodes is beneficial.},

pages={278-288 vol.1},
abstract={The paper considers the problem of routing a set of permanent virtual circuit requests over a backbone network. Several factors make this routing problem complicated. Routing decisions must be made on-line without any knowledge of future request sets. Furthermore, frequent rerouting to correct inefficiencies that can result from the on-line routing decisions is not possible since rerouting creates a service disruption for the customer. Finally, the forward and reverse bandwidth of a virtual circuit must be routed over the same single path. Using an extensive set of simulations, the paper evaluates several different strategies for on-line permanent virtual circuit routing. The authors find that a strategy based on results in competitive analysis and ideas from combinatorial optimization consistently provides the best performance. The problem of admission control is closely related to the problem of routing. The paper also provides a theoretical lower bound that suggests that non-greedy admission control is a fundamental component of an efficient on-line permanent virtual circuit routing algorithm.},

This method represents the one-step policy improvement on a chosen base policy. As a base policy /spl pi//sub 0/, we use the policy which allows direct link routing only. The policy /spl pi//sub 0/ also requires that each call class has a portion of link bandwidth dedicated to it. The task is to find an efficient computational way to obtain the corresponding relative cost values, which represent costs of routing a call over one link.

abstract={We consider a communication network in which dynamic routing is used for establishing connections that support information transfer between end-users. Link state information is exchanged and maintained up-to-date among network nodes for path computation and network resource allocation. When the population of users is large, the amount of link state information can be overwhelming. A common solution is to use a hierarchical structure. In this paper, we present a method for aggregating link state information in a hierarchical network. We assume that each link state parameter associated with a link is symmetrical in both directions of the link. The key idea for the method is to first reduce the original subnetwork topology to a full-mesh representation that consists of a logical link for each pair of border nodes in the subnetwork, and then encode the link state information associated with the full-mesh representation with an appropriate spanning tree.},

Next, an implementation scheme is proposed. We propose that the self-healing function be implemented as a software process, and that OAM cells are utilized for fast message transmission. Next, results of a prototype system that we implemented on an ATM cross-connect system are discussed. The fundamental characteristics of restoration performance are measured using an experimental network. Based on these results, an NE processing system analysis and computer simulation for estimating the characteristics as applied to a real-scale network are discussed. Finally, a management scheme for self-healing is proposed based on the TMN concept.},

abstract={The exact calculation of call blocking probabilities for multiservice ATM networks with alternate or adaptive routing for virtual channels (VC) is hardly possible. Therefore the paper presents and investigates the equivalent single path model as an approximation to omit the VC routing algorithm in the calculation. The model can be applied to ATM networks with several direct virtual path connections between each node pair. Further different methods to calculate the multiservice call blocking probabilities are reviewed and compared. A new approximate method is presented for networks, where the trunk reservation fairness mechanism is applied. This method is accurate, fast and may also be used for noninteger capacities and bandwidth requirements, which is important for statistical multiplexing of variable bitrate traffic.},

abstract={Discusses methods for adjusting the layout of virtual paths in an ATM network, to the dynamics of changes in the usage of the network by its end-users. The authors first present a centralized algorithm for finding a better layout for the current traffic pattern, and for applying the change in the network, and discuss its drawbacks. They then present a distributed algorithm that emulates the centralized algorithm with a much lower overhead, and enhanced durability to faults. They prove that both algorithms produce identical layouts, thus showing the superiority of the latter algorithm. Both algorithms base the changes in the network on a new rerouting protocol, which does not cause any losses in data, nor changes in the FIFO order of cells.},

abstract={We analyze the distribution of the delay of messages in an infinite capacity M/M/1 queue. A message is composed of n packets, and the arrival of the packets to the queue is Poisson. Our calculations are based on recursive schemes. We obtain explicit expressions for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform (LST) of the delays, which enables to obtain exact expressions for the moments of the delay in a complexity smaller than the one obtained by using recursive schemes. We repeat the above calculations for the case that messages are dispersed, i.e. packets from several sources arrive to an M/M/1 queue and are served according to the FIFO discipline. Hence, several packets of other messages may arrive between consecutive packets of a given message.},

abstract={Two asymptotic analyses of the queue length distribution at a statistical multiplexer supporting heterogeneous exponential on-off sources are considered. The first analysis is performed by approximating the cell generation rate as a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and then applying the Benes queueing formula. In the second analysis, we start with a system of linear equations derived from the exact expressions of the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix governing the queue length distribution. Assuming that there are a large number of sources, we obtain asymptotic approximations to the dominant eigenvalue. Based on the analyses, we define a traffic descriptor to include the mean and the variance of the cell generation rate and a burstiness measure. A simple expression for the quality of service (QoS) in cell loss rate is derived in terms of the traffic descriptor parameters and the multiplexer parameters (output link capacity and buffer size). This result is then used to quantify the factors determining the required capacity of a call taking the statistical multiplexing gain into consideration.},

This importance sampling technique has two phases, with a different importance sampling strategy in each phase.

abstract={Establishing a multicast tree in a point-to-point network of switch nodes, such as a wide-area ATM network, is often modeled as the NP-complete Steiner problem in networks. In this paper, we study algorithms for finding efficient multicast trees in the presence of constraints on the copying ability of the individual switch nodes in the network. We refer to this problem as the degree-constrained multicast tree problem and model it as the degree-constrained Steiner problem in networks. Steiner heuristics for the degree-constrained case are proposed and their simulation results for sparse, point-to-point networks are presented. The results are compared with respect to their quality of solution, cost (running time), and the number of test cases for which no solution could be found. The results of our research indicate that efficient multicast frees can be found in large, sparse networks with small multicast groups even with limited multicast capability in the individual switches. Some of the Steiner heuristics tested yielded degree-constrained multicast trees within 5% of the best heuristic solution found in most of the cases. Even when the fanout of each switch node was restricted to 2, the heuristics we used were able to generate efficient multicast trees in almost all our test networks. Surprisingly few test networks were unsolvable. In those cases where no solution was found by a heuristic, backtracking solved many of the remaining cases. Among the heuristics we used, degree-constrained versions of simple path-distance heuristics such as SPH and SPH-R provided the best tradeoffs between quality of solution and cost.},

abstract={A new heuristic algorithm is presented for constructing minimum-cost multicast trees with delay constraints. The new algorithm can set variable delay bounds on destinations and handles two variants of the network cost optimization goal: one minimizing the total cost (total bandwidth utilization) of the tree, and another minimizing the maximal link cost (the most congested link). Instead of the single-pass tree construction approach used in most previous heuristics, the new algorithm is based on a feasible search optimization method which starts with the minimum-delay tree and monotonically decreases the cost by iterative improvement of the delay-bounded tree. The optimality of the costs of the delay-bounded trees obtained with the new algorithm is analyzed by simulation. Depending on how tight the delay bounds are, the costs of the multicast trees obtained with the new algorithm are shown to be very close to the costs of the trees obtained by the Kou, Markowsky and Berman's algorithm (1981).},

A protocol is then developed to provide for dynamic allocation and release of multicast addresses, as well as maintaining state information for a connection. The protocol is independent of the address partitioning scheme; it is also shown to be robust and efficient. Finally, we describe two different mechanisms that enable the use of a common port number by all session participants.},

abstract={Multicasting in broadband packet switches and metropolitan networks can be achieved by first replicating the packets and then routing them to their destinations. This paper studies a very simple but general replication scheme that can be applied to arbitrary interconnection-network topologies. The replication process of a packet adapts itself according to the network topology and the traffic condition. Hot spots of replication activities are diffused by this scheme which automatically moves part of the replication efforts to less active network regions. The scheme can potentially be used in networks (e.g., the Manhattan-street network) in which multicasting were thought to be inherently difficult. Fundamental issues and critical problem areas are laid out, and solutions addressing them are proposed. The performance of the replication algorithm and its implementation (logic diagram level) in the shuffle-exchange copy network are investigated in detail. It is found that the performance of the algorithm improves with the increase of network dimensions.},

In designing a new traffic model, the authors retain the basic notion of a flow but allow the flow rate to fluctuate. In particular, they introduce the concept of a burst which, in a video flow, is a sequence of packets that carry the bits of an encoded picture. They present the architecture of a class of packet switching networks, called burst scheduling networks, for carrying video, audio, and data traffic. The class is characterized by (i) use of virtual clock value as priority in scheduling, (ii) end-to-end delay and delay jitter guarantees provided to flows conforming to the new traffic model, and (iii) traffic flows (in particular, video flows) scheduled efficiently in bursts. Some experimental results are presented from a discrete-event simulation in which traces from several MPEG video sequences were used as video sources.},

abstract={Considers methods that perform all point-to-multipoint permutations in ATM radix tree and banyan networks. The authors investigate the relationship between the structure of the routing tab and the ease of performing multicasting. They first consider a simple explicit addressing scheme that requires (N-1)(log/sub 2/N+1) routing bits. They then present an addressing filtering scheme that requires N routing bits. Next they propose a new method, the vertex isolation addressing (VIA) scheme, which requires r(N-1)/(r-1) bits for radix-r tree networks. Thus for binary trees the routing tab i 2(N-1) bits long and as r approaches N the routing tab approaches N bits. The authors demonstrate that the "excess" bits in the VIA routing tab provide certain error detection capabilities. Encoding and decoding algorithms and hardware implementations for the VIA method are presented. Modified VIA schemes are then investigated for large tree networks. Finally the authors show that the VIA scheme and its modifications are applicable to banyan networks.},

abstract={Introduces and analyzes a method for providing bandwidth reservations in an input-buffered non-blocking crossbar switch. The scheme, which the authors call weighted probabilistic iterative matching (WPIM), is an improvement over probabilistic iterative matching and allows flexible allocation of bandwidth among the switch inputs sharing a common output link in a simple manner. Weighted probabilistic iterative matching allocates the output bandwidth among the inputs based on reservations made during the connection setup phase, and can guarantee that traffic from each input receives its promised share of the bandwidth of the output link. In addition, the algorithm provides isolation between two flows arriving on distinct input links and directed at a common output link; misbehaving flows at one of the inputs do not affect the bandwidth guarantees or delays of traffic from other inputs. Results from simulations show that the scheme is able to maintain probabilistic bandwidth and delay guarantees in the presence of misbehaving traffic. the authors also derive an analytical upper bound for the average delay under the scheme and validate it by simulation.},

The SMARTNet architecture is ATM capable and fits naturally with, and takes best advantage of, the kinds of high speed optoelectronic and optical components that can actually be constructed. For certain meshed-ring regular physical topologies, an upper bound on the network's throughput efficiency is derived. Specific network configurations are demonstrated which achieve a throughput efficiency level which is close to 90% of this bound. Such network structures exhibit a throughput capacity level which is 80% higher than that realized by traditional (non-meshed) ring networks.},

abstract={Observations of both Ethernet traffic and variable bit rate (VBR) video traffic have demonstrated that these traffics exhibit "self-similarity" and/or infinite asymptotic index of dispersion for counts (IDC). We report here on measurements of traffic in a commercial public broadband network where similar characteristics have been observed. For the purpose of analysis and dimensioning of the central links of an ATM network we analyse in this paper the performance of a single server queue fed by Gaussian traffic with infinite IDC. The analysis lends to an approximation for the performance of a queue in which the arriving traffic is "fractal" Gaussian and consequently where there does not exist a dominant negative-exponential tail. The term "fractal" is used here in the sense that the autocovariance of the traffic exhibits self-similarity, that is to say, where the autocovariance of an aggregate of the traffic is the same, or asymptotically the same for large time lags, as the original traffic. We are not concerned with proving or exploiting this self-similarity property as such, but only with performance analysis techniques which are effective for such processes. In order to be able to test the performance analysis formulae, we show that traffic with the same autocovariance as measured in a real network over a wide range of lags (sufficiently wide a range for the traffic to be equivalent from the point of view of queueing performance) can be generated as a mixture of two Gaussian AR(1) processes. In this way we demonstrate that the analytic performance formulae are accurate.},

The proposed method consists of intra-stream and inter-stream synchronization mechanisms. The inter-stream synchronization control is performed after the intra-stream synchronization control. Then, whether the intra-stream synchronization is still maintained or not is checked. The mechanism con be used in networks which have unknown delay bounds, and it does not suppose periodical generation of media units such as video frames. It also deals with two types of media streams depending on how strictly to synchronize media streams: tightly-coupled media streams and loosely-coupled media streams. Furthermore, we enhance the mechanism to support real-time-inputted media streams as in TV conferencing.},

abstract={Multimedia distribution on demand will impose extremely severe bandwidth requirements on the distribution network and will require the use of very high capacity video servers. In the context of archival programs playout (typical video-on-demand applications), the information source can potentially be stored at any level in the distribution network. Part of the information may even be duplicated. Of course, there is a tradeoff between the bandwidth required to transport the programs to the users and the storage server capabilities of the overall deployment. The paper presents an analytical study of this tradeoff considering different mechanisms aimed at reducing the overall bandwidth and/or storage server costs. A model of the distribution network is established. A cost function is proposed to capture the different parameters and allow comparison of the possible strategies. Results provide good insight into the problem, and are used to discuss the proper placement of storage in a distribution network.},

abstract={The authors treat traffic control methods suitable to ATM LAN, in which two service classes are considered; one is for high speed data transfer based on a fast reservation protocol (FRP service class) and the other is for continuous bit rate (CBR) traffic such as motion video (CBR service class). The authors first evaluate the performance of the FRP service class. When the terminal requests the data transfer, its usable bandwidth is negotiated with the traffic descriptor (C/sub max/, C/sub min/) The former is a desirable data transfer rate, and the latter is a sustainable rate when the network is congested. By carrying out a mathematical analysis, the authors show an appropriate set of the traffic descriptor. The coexistence of FRP and CBR service classes are then treated. By using an analytic method, the performance of the CBR service class traffic is shown to be heavily affected by the FRP service class traffic. Therefore, the authors introduce a reserved bandwidth to the CBR service class to guarantee some appropriate level of performance to the CBR service class.},

pages={1044-1052 vol.3},
abstract={Although the product-form solution provides an accurate characterization of equilibrium voice-traffic behavior in wireless integrated voice/data networks, it does not directly provide a method to evaluate data-packet delay. However, examination of each link separately in a manner that incorporates interaction with the rest of the network permits one to take advantage of the wireless nature of the network and obtain a three-flow characterization of each link, which also satisfies a product-form solution and is hence termed a "mini-product-form" solution. By matching the values of these flows, which are natural to the wireless network, to the average values obtained from the product-form solution of the entire network, the authors obtain a three-dimensional Markov chain characterization of the voice occupancy state on the link, which permits a simpler evaluation of data-packet delay. A further reduction is possible by converting the three-dimensional chain to a single-dimensional one.},

abstract={Describes the design, validation, implementation and performance of an asymmetric link-layer protocol for a wireless link. The motivation for designing a new link-layer protocol is to obtain better performance in terms of end-to-end throughput and latency by correcting errors in an unreliable wireless link in addition to end-to-end correction rather than by correcting errors only by end-to-end retransmissions. The protocol described concentrates on asymmetry, although the concept of adaptive forward error correction is briefly introduced. The protocol also supports mobility. The asymmetry is needed in the design because the wireless terminals have limited power and smaller processing capability than the base stations. The key ideas in the design consist of placing the bulk of the intelligence in the base station as opposed to placing it symmetrically, in requiring the wireless terminal to combine several acknowledgments into a single acknowledgment to conserve power, and in designing the base stations to send periodic status messages, while making the acknowledgment from the wireless terminal event driven. The asymmetry in the protocol design results in a one-third reduction of the compiled code and a two-thirds reduction of processing overhead in the wireless terminal. Some performance results are also presented.},

pages={1063-1074 vol.3},
abstract={We propose a combined multicast routing and resource reservation protocol, termed reservation-based multicast (RBM), that performs routing in a fashion similar to protocol independent multicast (PIM), but which is intended for mobile operation and routes hierarchically-encoded data streams based on user-specified fidelity requirements, real-time delivery thresholds and prevailing network bandwidth constraints. The protocol retains the fully distributed operation, scalability and receiver-initiated orientation of PIM; but, unlike PIM, the protocol is tightly coupled to an underlying, distributed, unicast routing protocol thereby facilitating operation in a dynamic topology. This paper focuses on the initial route construction phase, assumed to occur during a static "snapshot" of the dynamic topology, and therefore outlines an approach to reservation-based multicast routing for fixed networks as well, e.g. the Internet.},

abstract={We introduce an adaptive call admission control mechanism for wireless/mobile networks supporting multimedia traffic, and discuss a number of resource sharing schemes which can be used to allocate wireless bandwidth to different classes of traffic. The adaptive call admission control reacts to changing new call arrival rates, and the resource sharing mechanism reacts to rapidly changing traffic conditions in every radio cell due to mobility of mobile users. In addition, we have provided an analytical methodology which shows that the combination of the call admission control and the resource sharing schemes guarantees a predefined quality-of-service to each class of traffic. One major advantage of our approach is that it can be performed in a distributed fashion removing any bottlenecks that might arise due to frequent invocation of network call control functions.},

abstract={Real-time multimedia applications will require guaranteed quality of service (QoS) such as a bound on the maximum message delay and/or on the maximum message loss rate. This poses an exciting challenge to the highspeed transport protocol design and implementations. In this paper, we study the resource and connection admission control algorithms, and give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the schedulability, of n real-time transport connections at a destination host under preemptive and non-preemptive deadline scheduling policy for deterministic QoS guarantees. These necessary and sufficient conditions form the mathematical basis for the deterministic QoS guarantees in real-time transport communication services. On the basis of these necessary and sufficient conditions, we give the connection admission control algorithms for deterministic QoS guarantees. We also calculate the buffer space needed for each real-time transport connection. The results show that real-time transport connections with deterministic QoS guarantees can reserve the buffer space at the establishment phase, and no flow control mechanism is required during the data transport phase. Our results could be applied to other fields as well, such as real-time operating systems.},

pages={1103-1110 vol.3},
abstract={Many network applications that require quality-of-service (QoS) support, such as transmission of digital voice and video, tolerate a certain level of service degradation. In this study, a novel network service, referred to as service with bounded degradation (BD service), is presented that can take advantage of the delay tolerance of applications. Different from previous proposals for similar services, the BD service can guarantee hard lower bounds of the service degradation. This is achieved by strictly limiting the amount of traffic that is subject to service degradation. To implement a BD service, network traffic is partitioned into components with different delay requirements. Policing of the traffic components is achieved by multi-level leaky buckets. A novel scheduler, referred to as EDD-BD (earliest deadline due-bounded degradation) scheduler, performs switching of packets. Properties of the EDD-BD scheduler are presented and analyzed.},

abstract={The sustainable cell rate (SCR) was introduced by the ATM Forum as a means of characterizing the statistical activity of ATM VBR connections. The SCR traffic descriptor (SCR-TD), composed of the sustainable cell rate 1/T/sub SCR/ and the intrinsic burst tolerance /spl tau//sub IBT/, is defined with respect to an algorithmic characterization, the generic cell rate algorithm (GCRA). This method makes source parameter enforcement straightforward. Unfortunately, the current specification of the SCR-TD is incomplete, leaving the source with an infinite number of (T/sub SCR/, /spl tau//sub IBT/) couples to choose from, This ambiguity could bear a negative impact on network efficiency. The authors investigate the issues involved in selecting suitable SCR-TD values for a given source, both from a user's perspective and from a networking point of view.},

pages={1137-1145 vol.3},
abstract={Compressed digital video is one of the most important types of traffic in future integrated services networks. It is difficult to support this class of traffic since, on one hand, compressed video is bursty, while on the other hand, it requires performance guarantees from the network. The common belief is that we are unlikely to achieve a high network utilization while providing performance guarantees to such bursty sources. The authors introduce a new deterministic bounding interval-dependent (D-BIND) traffic model, together with tight analysis techniques, to explore the possibility of providing deterministic performance guarantees to VBR traffic while still achieving a reasonable network utilization. The D-BIND model consists of a family of rate-interval pairs where the rate is a bounding rate over the interval length. The model captures the intuitive property that over longer interval lengths, a source may be bounded by a rate lower than its peak rate and closer to its long-term overage rate. While the D-BIND model is a general deterministic model that can be used to characterize a wide variety of sources, the authors focus on MPEG-compressed video. Using two 10 minute traces, they demonstrate the effectiveness of the new model and show that, contrary to common belief, reasonable network utilization can be achieved for compressed video, even when deterministic guarantees are provided.},

In particular, the slot reuse protocol proposed for the IEEE 802.6e standard [Hassanein et al., 1994] results in unfair steady state bandwidth allocations for some overloaded DQDB networks and can cause unbounded access delays under some stable workloads. In contrast, a previously proposed simple counter protocol results in bandwidth allocations in overload that are shown to be at least weakly fair for all workloads and optimally fair for many important workloads. This simple protocol also guarantees bounded access delays for any stable workload. A new modified counter protocol is proposed that has superior fairness characteristics to either of the previous protocols.},

The allocation scheme is guaranteed to find a feasible slot allocation (in the sense that all messages can be transmitted in a timely manner) as long as the total message density is less than or equal to a certain threshold, where the total message density is defined as the summation (over all message streams) of the ratio of maximum message size to message deadline. The implementation of this scheme is simple and does not require any change of the current DQDB standard.},

The match of demand and service patterns is achieved at fairly uniform delays and success rates of transmission at every node.

Analysis and simulation studies for three standard load patterns, viz., symmetric, asymmetric and equal probability loads, show that it outperforms the bandwidth balancing mechanism.},

abstract={DQDB is the IEEE 802.6 MAC standard protocol for metropolitan area networks. It is designed for the slotted, dual BUS configuration. A simple way to improve the performance of DQDB is to perform slot reuse and many methods have been suggested in the past to efficiently incorporate slot reuse with DQDB. However, some of them can lead to starvation. The authors improve one of these previous suggestions and the main contribution of the paper is that for the first time they also provide a proof that the improved scheme ensures lack of starvation.

Applications communicate over the V-NET by using simplex end-to-end network connections which support specific real-time and reliability characteristics tailored to meet the application's specified requirements. V-NET differs from other proposed architectures in that it does not assume one specific packet scheduling algorithm or a specific traffic policing mechanism.

abstract={The loop-free path-finding algorithm (LPA) is presented. LPA specifies the second-to-last hop and distance to each destination to ensure termination; in addition, it uses an inter-neighbor synchronization mechanism to eliminate temporary loops. A detailed proof of LPA's correctness is presented and its complexity is evaluated. LPA's average performance is compared by simulation with the performance of algorithms representative of the state of the art in distributed routing, namely an ideal link-state (ILS) algorithm and a loop free algorithm that is based on internodal coordination spanning multiple hops (DUAL). The simulation results show that LPA is a more scalable alternative than DUAL and ILS in terms of the average number of steps, messages, and operations needed for each algorithm to converge after a topology change. LPA is shown to achieve loop freedom at every instant without much additional overhead over that incurred by prior algorithms based on second-to-last hop and distance information.},

abstract={Proposes a new self-routing ATM switch. The switch is constructed based on a banyan network in which each inter-stage link is dilated by the stage number power of 2, each dilated link is concentrated from 2/sup d+1/ to 2/sup d/ multiple paths after stage d, and a new proposed shared-link design is used to reduce the cell blocking probabilities yielded by the concentration. By the scheme of interleaving the dilation, concentration, and sharing idle links after stage d, the new network has the advantages: (1) the delay-throughput performance is approximately the same as that of a knockout network with 2/sup d/ output links per output concentrator under the uniform traffic; (2) the hardware cost of network is of O(d2/sup d/nlogn)/spl ap/O(nlogn) as d is small; (3) the self-routing mechanism is very simple and identical to that of a banyan network; and (4) it is very feasible in VLSI design that only three simple and regular CMOS chips are enough to construct any size of ATM switch.},

abstract={The technique of virtual paths is used in ATM networks to perform bandwidth allocation for virtual circuits and to simplify setting up of virtual circuits in response to connection requests. The author describe a new technique called virtual trees that can be used for bandwidth allocation in ATM networks. A virtual tree corresponds to pre-allocated bandwidth along a set of links in the network that form a tree rooted at a source node and leading to various destinations. The use of virtual trees provides more flexibility to a source node in setting up a virtual circuit and results in smaller rejection probabilities for connection requests. virtual trees retain all the advantages of virtual paths but have a better performance potential. The authors present an optimization model for bandwidth allocation for virtual tree configurations and present the results of a simulation study comparing the performance of virtual trees with that of virtual paths.},

abstract={This paper proposes a framework for optimal policing in ATM networks. A general approach to modeling controllers which implement the policing function is described using finite-state automata. The theory of finite-state accepting automata and regular expressions enables the symbolic computation of the worst-case source and therefore provides a basis for the formulation and derivation of optimal bandwidth enforcement schemes. Exhaustive searches are performed for small cases to find optimal finite-state automata. These optimal results are extended to obtain near-optimal solutions for higher-state automata. The optimal and near-optimal finite-state automata are compared to existing schemes, such as leaky buckets, and improvement in terms of cell loss rate of the declared source is achieved.},

pages={1248-1255 vol.3},
abstract={Because of the burstiness of video traffic, a very large sampling interval is needed to obtain acceptable cell loss probability. Previous studies reported very high cell loss probabilities for well-behaved sources when using the leaky bucket mechanism (LB) to police VBR video sources. In this paper, a mean rate policing mechanism called cooperating leaky bucket (CLB) is introduced. This mechanism can attain better cell loss probability by sharing the leaky buckets among all sources. In addition, it guarantees that the cell loss probability will never be higher than that obtained by LB. Depending on the number of traffic sources available, the cell loss probability can be significantly reduced when compared to LB. At the same time, the combined traffic entering the network is enforced to below the total negotiated traffic rate. Moreover, the additional overhead due to the implementation of CLB is minimal.},

One-way on-the-fly reservation is a method for allocating resources for short bursts of data when regular reservation is too costly. The first such algorithms were recently suggested by Turner. We investigate two examples that are characteristic to the way traffic streams interact in virtual circuit networks: a three node subnetwork that also acts as a 4/spl times/2 switch and a ring. For both systems we compute system throughput under homogeneous load, and compare it with the throughput when fast reservation protocols are used. For the three node subnetwork we also give an explicit expression for an upper bound.},

abstract={The ATM adaptation layer type 5 (AAL5) is a new adaptation layer protocol for the ATM layer of broadband integrated services digital networks. Among several features, it is unique in the sense that it includes an end-of-packet (EOP) indicator in the header of the ATM cell (the ATM-layer-user-to-ATM-layer-user (AUU) parameter in the payload type (PT) field). It was previously suggested that the use of this indicator may be used to provide a means by which buffer occupancy can be reduced by dropping cells from already incomplete packets (Armitage, 1993). The objective of this paper is to study the performance of this layer and the effectiveness of the EOP indicator. The performance measures of interest are the probability of packet loss and the mean packet delay. An approximate analytical model is constructed in which the blocking of a tagged source is kept track of in an exact manner. The rest of the sources are modeled approximately. The accuracy of the model is enhanced through an iterative approach. A simulation model is also constructed to assess the accuracy of the approximate model.},

abstract={The MetaRing is a medium access control (MAC) protocol for LANs and MANs operating at a speed of 1 Gbit/sec and above. The MetaRing MAC protocol offers its users synchronous and asynchronous types of services and can operate under two basic access control modes: buffer insertion for variable size packets, and slotted for fixed length cells. The latter mode of operation is considered in this paper. In the first part of the paper an analysis of the asynchronous type of service is performed. The analysis has been carried out on a network configuration (hereafter called scenario) which, other than being realistic, is particularly critical with respect to slot reuse. It consists of a group of equally spaced nodes sending asynchronous traffic to a gateway interconnecting the MetaRing with other communication subnetworks. Results obtained show that the MetaRing is unfair and that the unfairness depends, in particular, upon the offered load, besides the K and L protocol parameter values. In the second part of the paper we focus on the study of the traffic integration capability provided by the MetaRing MAC protocol. The results provide a strong indication that the MetaRing MAC protocol is suitable for VBR video and data traffic integrations.},

abstract={A closed-form analytical expression is derived for the individual priority classes of FDDI based on a nonpreemptive priority delay model. To faithfully model the FDDI network using the nonpreemptive priority delay model, we use a concept of modified-vacations. The expressions for the mean waiting time of individual priority classes are functions of first and second moments of the modified-vacation intervals of that class. It can be shown that the expression derived for the first and second moments of the modified-vacation intervals of the respective classes are functions of mean and variance of the number of messages transmitted by each priority class per token rotation. These variables are evaluated using an iterative procedure that utilizes the prior knowledge of the throughput characteristics of the FDDI network. Simulation results show that the nonpreemptive priority delay model provides accurate estimates for the mean waiting time of individual priority classes of a homogeneous FDDI network.},

pages={1290-1299 vol.3},
abstract={In this paper, we present three logarithmically scalable routing algorithms for very large optical networks. The algorithms are based on a hierarchical approach. Each algorithm requires a different amount of information to be stored at each node, and results in a different efficiency. The network capacity provided by each algorithm is compared with that provided by the global shortest path algorithm (which is not scalable). It is found that the network capacities of the three algorithms are almost the same as that of the global shortest path algorithm. For fixed routing algorithms, we use an approximate analysis from which the blocking probability at a fixed network load can iterately be obtained (we use call blocking probability as our quality objective and compare network capacity by observing the difference in the offered load which produces the same blocking probability). The approximate analysis is validated through simulation and is found to be very accurate. Scalable, quasi-dynamic routing algorithms are also studied. Numerical results show that, when the node-capacity is equal to the capacity of a single wavelength and the bandwidth required per call is large ( greater than 24% of the link capacity), the capacity provided by the quasi-dynamic routing algorithm is very close to that of an infinite capacity centralized switch (lowest possible call blocking caused exclusively by congestion on the finite capacity user input/output links, never by the switch fabric itself). In all the examples considered, the improvement of the quasi-dynamic routing algorithm over the fixed routing algorithm is significant.},

Various policies for wavelength routing, and the corresponding assignment of wavelengths along the routes have been studied before, which are based on minimizing congestion, average hop-distance, and call blocking probability or on maximizing carried traffic, and the number of clear channels. However these approaches often lead to scenarios where a significant number of available wavelengths at the input/output ports of the routers cannot be used due to potential wavelength conflict. The wavelength routing and assignment algorithms presented in this paper focus on maximizing the wavelength-utilization at the switching devices which also improve the overall network performance.},

In the future, customers will demand increasingly high bandwidth services requiring TONs to be regularly upgraded.

year={1995},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1316-1325 vol.3},
abstract={This paper considers the problem of designing a logical topology over a wavelength-routed all-optical network physical topology. The physical topology consists of the nodes and fiber links in the network. On an all-optical network physical topology, we can set up lightpaths between pairs of nodes, where a lightpath represents a direct optical connection without any intermediate electronics. The set of lightpaths along with the nodes constitutes the logical topology. For a given network physical topology and traffic pattern (relative traffic distribution among the source-destination pairs), our objective is to design the logical topology and the routing algorithm on that topology so as to maximize the network throughput while constraining the average delay seen by a source-destination pair and the amount of processing required at the nodes (degree of the logical topology). We will see that ignoring the delay constraints can result in fairly convoluted logical topologies with very long delays. On the other hand, in all our examples, imposing it results in a minimal reduction in throughput. While the number of wavelengths required to imbed the resulting logical topology on the physical all-optical topology is also a constraint in general, we find that in many cases of interest this number can be quite small. We formulate the combined logical topology design and routing problem described above (ignoring the constraint on the number of available wavelengths) as a mixed integer programming problem which we then solve for a number of cases of a 6-node network. Since this programming problem is computationally intractable for larger networks, we split it into two subproblems: logical topology design, which is computationally hard and will probably require heuristic algorithms, and routing, which can be solved by a linear program. We then compare the performance of two heuristic topology design algorithms (that do take wavelength assignment constraints into account) against that of randomly generated topologies.},

abstract={This paper investigates a wavelength-division-multiplexed optical packet switch with wavelength converters which can shift optical packets to any wavelength of their destined outbound links. Wavelength conversion can reduce packet dropping probability due to wavelength contentions. However, not all the packets need conversion, and hence conversion should be optimized to reduce the number of converters and improve the quality of signals by reducing unnecessary conversion. We derive the maximum number of conversions in a packet switch with l inbound/outbound links and w wavelengths per link and develop a switch control algorithm to minimize the number of wavelength conversions while maintaining the same minimum number of dropped packets.

abstract={We consider single-hop all-optical networks in which wavelength-routed connections (lightpaths) between source-destination pairs are dynamically established and torn down in response to a random pattern of arriving connection requests and connection holding times. A connection request may be blocked if no wavelength is available on a suitable path from source to destination. For these networks we consider several methods for routing and wavelength assignment which combine in various ways three main principles: wavelength reservation, protecting threshold and alternate routes. The methods are evaluated and compared in two case studies. In this type of network the traffic over lightpaths consisting of multiple links is susceptible to high blocking probabilities, which can interfere with the quality of service requirements. It is shown that some of the routing and wavelength assignment methods studied have the potential to overcome this difficulty.},

abstract={This paper investigates video aggregation, a concept that integrates compression and multiplexing of video information. We focus on the transmission of a group of video sessions as a bundle, the practical examples of which include entertainment-video broadcast and video-on-demand. The shortcomings of the approaches that separate the processes of compression and multiplexing are explained from the viewpoints of image quality, bandwidth usage, network management and operation. We argue that it is better to perform compression and multiplexing together before the bundle of video traffic enters the network. This paper presents preliminary experimental results which indicate that video aggregation can provide better image quality for a given bandwidth than traditional statistical multiplexing.},

abstract={This paper investigates soft multiplexing, an issue that arises in VP-based ATM networks. The main distinguishing feature of this form of multiplexing (as opposed to traditional statistical multiplexing) is that the output channel is a variable-bit rate VP. The concepts of work conservation and greediness were introduced to study soft multiplexing systematically. We assume that the overall multiplexed output traffic is regulated and policed by a leaky bucket. Before being allowed to access the output channel, each input traffic stream is also controlled by a leaky bucket. It is shown that although strict performance guarantee can be provided to each input traffic stream by independent leaky bucket operation, output-channel utilization can be rather low, and it can be improved significantly if we allow some interactions among the leaky buckets of the input streams. In particular, we show that two simple soft-multiplexing schemes, excess token passing and token borrowing, can achieve higher output-channel utilization, better delay and loss performance without sacrificing guarantee to each session.},

abstract={This paper presents a study of the statistical characteristics and multiplexing of variable-bit-rate (VBR) MPEG-coded video streams. Our results are based on 23 minutes of video obtained from the entertainment movie, The Wizard of Oz. The experimental setup which was used to capture, digitize, and compress the video stream is described. Although the study is conducted at the frame level (as opposed to the slice level), it is observed that the inter-frame correlation structure for the frame-size sequence involves complicated forms of pseudo-periodicity that are mainly affected by the compression pattern of the sequence. A simple model for an MPEG traffic source is developed in which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the original captured video stream. The number of cells per frame is fitted by a lognormal distribution. Simulations are used to study the performance of an ATM multiplexer for MPEG streams.},

abstract={We consider an ATM system with an architecture which is designed to accommodate users with very different quality of service requirements. Sources which belong to a high priority class share a FCFS buffer, which has priority access to the trunk. A low priority class of sources have a separate FCFS buffer, which receives the residual bandwidth, if any. By administering admission control the service guarantees for both classes may be satisfied. The sources are bursty and stochastic fluid models are used to handle burst-scale congestion effects. We develop simple, fast and robust analytic approximations for the queue distributions in the two buffers. We calculate the admissible set by using our analytic approximations and find that it is reasonably accurate and a conservative approximation to the correct set. The key element in our analysis is a characterization of the output of the high priority buffer as another Markov-modulated fluid source. A refinement to the now well known effective bandwidth approximation is used to calculate buffer content distributions.},

year={1995},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={481-489 vol.2},
abstract={We propose a per-user forwarding strategy for locating users who move from place to place while using personal communications services (PCS). The forwarding strategy augments the basic location strategy proposed in existing standards such as GSM and IS-41, with the objective of reducing network signalling and database loads in exchange for increased CPU processing and memory costs. With the forwarding strategy, calls to a given user will first query the user's home location register (HLR) to determine the first visitor location register (VLR) which the user was registered at, and then follow a chain of forwarding pointers to the user's current VLR. This strategy is useful for those users who receive calls infrequently relative to the rate at which they change registration areas. We use a reference PCS architecture and the notion of a user's call-to-mobility ratio (CMR) to quantify the costs and benefits of using forwarding and classes of users for whom it would be beneficial. We show that sender a variety of assumptions forwarding is likely to yield significant net benefits for certain classes of users, in exchange (possibly) for a small increase in mean call setup time. For instance, under certain cost assumptions, for users with CMR<1 forwarding can result in 20-60% savings over the basic strategy, with no increase in mean call setup time.},

abstract={Efficient paging procedures help minimize the amount of bandwidth expended in locating a mobile unit. Given a probability distribution on user location, the optimal paging strategy which minimized the expected number of locations polled E[L] is to query each location sequentially in order of decreasing probability. However, since sequential search over many locations may impose unacceptable polling delay, D, optimal paging subject to delay constraints is considered. Substantial reductions in E[L] can be had even after moderate constraints are imposed on acceptable D (i.e., D/spl les/3) Since all methods of mobility management eventually reduce to considering a time-varying probability distribution on user location, this work should be applicable to a wide range of problems in the area. Most notably those with additive cost structures.},

The purpose of the new protocol is to minimize these consequences of location changes: as long as a mobile moves from one cell to another but stays in the same region, the protocol avoids loss of packets and preserves order of transmission. Thus it increases the performance of the transport layer protocol by minimizing the need to retransmit packets.},

As before, we consider non-complete-sharing policies involving upper-limit and guaranteed-minimum bounds for the different classes, but here we consider both bounds simultaneously.

They also suggest modifying the lowest level of the tree in order to reflect neighboring geographical regions more accurately and to support simple location data management. The modification of the lowest level also supports simple handoffs. The update of the proposed location database ensures correct location data following any number of transient faults that corrupt the location database information and thus is self-stabilizing.},

The system identification is used to measure transmission delays between two arbitrarily selected nodes in the networks, and multilevel network management is achieved by selecting those two nodes appropriately in accordance with the levels to be managed.},

abstract={In communication networks, a large number of alarms exist to signal any abnormal behavior of the network. As network faults typically result in a number of alarms, correlating these different alarms and identifying their source is a major problem in fault management. The alarm correlation problem is of major practical significance. Alarms that have not been correlated may not only lead to significant misdirected efforts, based on insufficient information, but may cause multiple corrective actions (possibly contradictory) as each alert is handled independently. The paper proposes a general framework to solve the alarm correlation problem. The authors introduce a new model for faults and alarms based on probabilistic finite state machines. They propose two algorithms. The first one acquires the fault models starting from possibly incomplete and incorrect date. The second one correlates alarms in the presence of multiple faults and noisy information. Both algorithms have polynomial time complexity, use an extension of the Viterbi algorithm to deal with the corrupted data, and can be implemented in hardware. As an example, they are applied to analyse faults using data generated by the ANS (Advanced Network and Services, Inc.)/NSF T3 network.},

abstract={A noncooperative network is considered, in which each user routes its flow in a way that optimizes its individual performance objective. Nash equilibria characterize the operating points of the network. The network designer aims to allocate link capacities, so that the resulting Nash equilibria are efficient, according to some system-wide performance criterion. In a noncooperative setting, the solution of such design problems is, in general, complex and at times counterintuitive, since adding link capacity might lead to degradation of user performance. For systems of parallel links, it is shown that such paradoxes do not occur and that the capacity allocation problem has a simple and intuitive optimal solution, that coincides with the solution in the single-user case. Extensions to general network topologies are also derived.},

Conversely, in the dynamic version of the multicast problem, the identities of the destination nodes are revealed to the routing algorithm one by one. The authors studied three MFCR-based multicast routing algorithms: one for the static multicast problem and two for the dynamic multicast problem.

At each time period each node selects an outgoing link, through which an incoming packet is sent. No buffers are used. We investigate first the problem of how to route a network-wide demand of packets, given the predetermined schedule. We show that certain versions of the problem have efficient solutions, while other versions are intractable. We then consider the problem of finding an optimal schedule given a network-wide demand of packets. We indicate that the problem is tractable for either a single source or single destination. However for the multi-source multi-destination case we show that it is an NP-complete problem. The problem remains intractable even for a simple topology of nodes arranged on a bidirectional line. We present an efficient heuristic for directed tree-networks, and adapt it to general topologies through a recursive scheme, for which an efficient performance bound is shown.},

As a consequence, cell routing becomes more flexible and significant call setup processing can be reduced when resources are reserved on VP's. In this paper, we study the routing problem in homogeneous VP-based ATM networks in which VP's are used for traffic segregation such that all VC's in a VP have the same traffic characteristics and QOS requirement. Four adaptive routing algorithms based on the least loaded routing (LLR) concept are designed and evaluated. Our simulation results show that network blocking probability can be significantly reduced by LLR routing.},

abstract={In this paper a new algorithm based on aggregation/disaggregation and decomposition/composition (HAD) scheme is proposed to solve the optimal routing problems (ORP) for hierarchically structured networks. Our algorithm has two major differences with the existing HAD algorithms for hierarchically clustered networks: 1. Our algorithm works with networks which are more general than networks with clustered structure; 2. Our algorithm parallelizes the computations for different commodities so that it speeds up with a parallel time complexity of O(mlog/sup 2/(n)), which is much less than O(Mlog/sup 2/(n)) needed for the existing HAD algorithms, for an n-node network with M commodities. Here, m is a positive number usually much smaller than M and is a function of the patterns of all the commodities. The implementation of the algorithm for a 200-node network is simulated using the OPNET simulation package.},

abstract={The analytical tool developed in this paper provides a general solution technique for the integration of traffic measurement and queueing analysis. The frequency-domain approach is used to combine the advanced techniques in two areas: signal processing and queueing analysis. Essentially, signal processing techniques are used to obtain the steady-state and second-order statistics of a traffic stream. The focus here is on the construction of a special class of Markov chains that can statistically match with each given traffic stream (or superposition of different traffic streams). The analytical queueing solutions can therefore be obtained by the folding-algorithm based on the Markov chain input modeling. Comprehensive numerical examples show the great potential of the SMAQ tool to solve measurement-based traffic management issues.},

pages={613-623 vol.2},
abstract={Consider a class of queueing systems which can be modeled by a finite quasi-birth-death (QBD) process. In this paper we develop a powerful computational technique for spectral analyses (i.e. second-order statistics) of output, queue and loss. Emphasis is placed on output power spectrum and input-output coherence function in response to various input power spectral properties and system parameters. The coherence function is defined to measure linear relationship between input and output processes. A key technical contribution of this paper is the exploration of linearity of low frequency traffic flow. Through the evaluation of the coherence function, one can identify a so-called nonlinear break frequency, /spl omega//sub b/, under which the low frequency traffic stay intact via a queueing system. Such a low frequency I/O linearity plays an important role in characterizing the output process, which may form a partial input to other "downstream" queues of the network. After all, it is the "upstream" output low frequency characteristics that will have most impact on the "downstream" queueing performance. Our study further indicates that the link capacity required by an input process is essentially characterized by its maximum input rate filtered at /spl omega//sub b/.},

abstract={Message-based process architectures are widely regarded as an effective method for structuring parallel protocol processing on shared memory multi-processor platforms. A message-based process architecture binds one or more processing elements with data messages and control messages received from applications and network interfaces. In this architecture, parallelism is achieved by simultaneously escorting multiple messages on separate processing elements through a stack of protocol tasks. The paper reports performance results from empirical comparisons of a connection-oriented TCP/IP protocol stack implemented using two different parallel message-based process architectures. These performance experiments measure the throughput, context switching, and synchronization exhibited by the two process architectures on a shared memory multi-processor platform. The experimental results demonstrate the extent to which the selection of a parallel process architecture affects protocol stack performance.},

abstract={Develops and analyzes a dilated high performance fault tolerant fast packet multistage interconnection network (MIN). In this new design, the links at the input and the output stages of a dilated banyan-based MIN are rearranged to create multiple routes for each source-destination pair in the network after removing one stage in the network. These multiple paths are link- and node-disjoint. Fault tolerance at low latency is achieved by sending multiple copies of each input packet simultaneously using different routes and different priorities. This guarantees that high throughput is maintained even in the presence of fault. Throughput is analyzed using simulation and analysis and the authors show that the new design has considerably higher performance in the presence of a faulty switching element (SE) or link in comparison to dilated networks.},

The fat-banyan switch model is a unifying model for the design and analysis of dilated banyan switches. The dilated banyan network forms a special case of the fat-banyan model. By keeping the number of input and output links of a switching element to be variable, the fat-banyan switch achieves a lower order of complexity than the dilated banyan.

abstract={A technique for the efficient analysis of multistage ATM switch architectures is presented. It is flexible in that it permits arbitrary switching element sizes, a full range of hardware speedup and backpressure between stages. The arriving traffic is assumed to be bursty and the authors do not assume homogeneity of all traffic sources. The flow of cells through the network is approximated as a fluid process, yielding computational complexity that depends only on the representation of the arrival and departure processes of a queue, independent of the number of buffers. Simulation results verify the accuracy of this approach. Finally, the analysis is used to examine the effect of nonhomogeneous traffic, as well as to present a comparison of the various modes of operation and implementation parameters of the multistage switch, providing insights on design trade-offs.},

abstract={Rearrangeable multihop lightwave networks can be dynamically reconfigured to adapt the connectivity among network stations to prevailing traffic conditions. Most of the literature has analyzed the performance of such networks assuming no limitations on the range of tunability of the transmitters and/or receivers allocated to each network station. Therefore, all connection diagrams could be realized among network stations, within the constraints of the number of transmitters and receivers at each station. Since the number of wavelengths in use may be very large, a practical implementation would restrict the tunability range of each transmitter and receiver to some limited set of contiguous wavelengths, or waveband. However, there is a penalty associated with such restrictions in that all connection diagrams might not be achievable and the network performances could degrade. The author derives lower bounds on the performance degradation experienced by the network when there are tunability limitations. He then proposes and analyzes a waveband assignment and grouping scheme, illustrating that one can design networks with good performance even though there are tunability constraints on the transceivers. He also describes other architectures (multi-fiber physical topology, subcarrier division multiplexing) for which the model and analysis readily apply.},

It is shown that this type of logical topology yields networks which have significantly superior performance features, when compared with either purely optical networks, or with multihop networks based on point-to-point connections.

abstract={WDM multihop networks require that their virtual topology and routing algorithm be simple and efficient while providing extremely high performance. To comply with this, the interconnections of the bidirectional manhattan street network (BMSN) is hierarchically rearranged. The resulting virtual topology constitutes a four-connected MSN-based network called the hierarchical MSN (HMSN). Having the same node degree as BMSN, the proposed HMSN increases no H/W complexity. Routing in HMSN is not also a serious burden to the overall processing overhead since it is a simple two-level extension of the deflection routing used in the two-connected MSNs. Nevertheless, HMSN performs better than the competing BMSN. This improvement in network delay and throughput is verified through numerical implementations.},

The jitter second-order statistics are shown to depend strongly on those of the queue, and the queue second-order statistics depend strongly on those of the input traffic. The authors show that the shape of the jitter correlation is determined by the weighted difference in queue correlations, and they derive a method for obtaining the weights for an MMPP traffic stream. In the numerical study emphasis is placed on a periodic traffic stream (such as CBR video) multiplexed on a major communication node; the authors investigate the impact of input traffic correlations and queueing system parameters on the queue length and delay jitter second-order statistics.

abstract={The major source of errors in B-ISDN/ATM systems is expected to be buffer overflow during congested conditions, resulting in ATM cell losses which degrade the quality of service. It has been shown by many authors that the performance of the end-to-end system can be made much less sensitive to cell loss by means of forward error correction. This paper discusses the use of a two-level forward error correction scheme for virtual channel and virtual path connections in ATM networks. The scheme exploits simple block coding and code interleaving simultaneously. The simple block, interleaved, and joint coding schemes are studied and analyzed by using a novel and accurate discrete-time analytical method which enables the burstiness of cell losses be captured precisely. Detailed performance calculations, which indicate that it is possible to reduce the cell loss rate by several orders of magnitude over a wide range of network load for various traffic conditions, are discussed, and compared with simulation results. The comparisons show that the method is very accurate for bursty traffic. The advantages of the three coding techniques are quantified for different traffic characteristics and scenarios.},

The amount of excess traffic released is varied dynamically based on delayed feedback from the bottleneck. We present analytical and numerical results for this model that allow us to study the role of delayed feedback vis-a-vis certain time constants and traffic parameters associated with the system. In particular we show that even for a large propagation delay such as that required for the length of the continental USA the feedback policy is more effective, though the relative improvement of the feedback policy decreases as the delay increases.

abstract={TES (transform-expand-sample) is a versatile class of stationary stochastic processes which can model arbitrary marginals, a wide variety of autocorrelation functions, and a broad range of sample path behaviors. TES models include one set of parameters for exact fitting of the empirical distribution (histogram), and another for approximating the empirical autocorrelation function. The former is easy to determine algorithmically, but the latter involves a hard heuristic search on a large parametric function space. This paper describes an algorithmic procedure which largely automates TES modeling. The algorithm is cast in a nonlinear programming setting with the objective of minimizing a weighted square distance between the empirical autocorrelation function and its candidate TES-model counterpart. It combines a brute-force search with a steepest-descent nonlinear programming technique, and it performs well owing to the simplicity of the constraints and the nice local behavior of the objective function. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of our approach via two examples from the domain of VBR (variable bit rate) compressed video.},

abstract={In this paper we analyze the performance of a video transport across an ATM network that uses both retransmission and concealment to recover from errors due to cell loss resulting from congestion. We limit the number of retransmission attempts to one. If a frame is still in error after one retransmission attempt, the remaining errors are concealed. We obtain analytic expressions for the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) with combined retransmission and concealment. The analysis shows that significant improvement in the signal to noise ratio of the reconstructed picture can be achieved if retransmission and concealment are used together.},

abstract={This paper presents an efficient transmission mechanism, using frame spreading, for variable bitrate (VBR) MPEG compressed video, through an ATM multiplexer, such as a cable head-end. A priority scheme is implemented in a software MPEG encoder which produces a proportionate traffic in both (i.e., high and low) priority partitions for all three frame types (intraframe, predicted and interpolated) used in MPEG. An ATM multiplexer with a pushout buffer scheme is implemented for the study, in order to provide priority scheduling at the multiplexer for the two priority partitions. The multiplexer is fed with VBR MPEG traffic and performance statistics such as the cell loss ratios are studied for various frame spreading scenarios. Two statistical models are developed using TES (transform expand sample) for VBR MPEG video having two levels of priority. The first model is matched with the empirical histogram and autocorrelation function of each frame type (I, P and B). The second model is created with the assumption of a gamma distribution for the number of bits in each frame type. Experiments are conducted using both models and the results are compared.},

abstract={The effect of long-memory processes on queue length statistics of a single queue system is studied through a controlled fractionally differenced ARIMA (1,d,0) input process. This process has two parameters /spl phi//sub 1/ and d representing an auto-regressive component and a long-range dependent component, respectively. Results show that the queue length statistics studied (mean, variance and the 0.999 quantile) are proportional to e(c/sup c/spl phi/1/) e(c/sub 2/d), where (c/sub 1/, c/sub 2/) are positive constants, and c/sub 2/>c/sub 1/. The effect of the auto-correlation structure on queue length statistics is also dependent on the tail of the distribution of the input process. Therefore, multiplexing gains can be achieved for long-range dependent processes because the resulting process has a tighter tail distribution. Given these observations, and the need to provide guaranteed maximum-delay, delay-jitter bounds, and low cell-loss probabilities, the solution appears to be (a) allocating higher rates if the distribution tails are large, (b) using multiplexing to narrow these tails, (c) applying a per circuit frame-clock in conjunction with an active cell-discard strategy to deal with long-range dependence.},

abstract={In addition to the large data size requirement and real-time constraint in continuous media, future video applications such as video editing demands the flexible storage placement and the random access capability on the video-frame level. To offer efficient buffering schemes and flexible storage placement for supporting random access, we present two buffering schemes: the two-buffer scheme and the k-buffer compensation scheme. The two-buffer scheme requires only all the frames in a block to be stored consecutively while providing random access between blocks. However, this intuitive buffering scheme potentially requires a large block size and buffer space. The k-buffer compensation scheme is proposed to resolve this large buffer space requirement by using more than two buffers and requiring a minimal number of blocks randomly placed in each cylinder. Experimental measurement results reveal the significant improvements on the buffer-size reduction and placement flexibility by using the k-buffer compensation scheme.},

abstract={The leaky bucket (LB) access control scheme has been widely proposed as the usage parameter control (UPC) mechanism at the user-network interface (UNI) for B-ISDN. An important goal for any UPC scheme is that it be able to accommodate a wide range of services. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the LB as an access control mechanism for transmission of variable bit rate (VBR) MPEG video. In particular, we focus on the following issues: 1) the requirements for lossless video transmission, 2) the trade-offs between token pool size and token regeneration rate, 3) the effect of traffic smoothing and 4) the performance of different encoded video sequences. Finally, we present a new technique for VBR video transmission using multiple LB's and we discuss the advantages of this techniques when cell losses occur.},

abstract={A framework for adaptive bandwidth management in ATM based networks is presented. The central concept of this approach is an adaptive estimation of the aggregate effective bandwidth required by connections carried on each link of the network. To achieve reliable results the estimation process takes into account both the traffic source declarations and the connection superposition process measurements on the network links. This is done in an optimization framework provided by estimation theory. In the paper the authors concentrate on evaluation of a bandwidth reserved for possible estimation error. For this purpose they use the error covariance matrix from a linear two state Kalman filter applied for the system state estimation. The bandwidth reserved for the estimation error provides that the source parameter declarations can be more relaxed and that the source policing can be less stringent.},

abstract={A multimedia ATM network is shared by media channels with different performance requirements and traffic characteristics. To make efficient use of network resources, the quality of service provided to the users should be as close as possible to their requirements. A scheme with two levels of cell loss priority within each channel is proposed. Priorities are assigned and enforced by the network locally at each switch along the path of a connection. The assignment, which can be different for the same connection at two different switches, is also dynamic; it is updated every time a connection is set up or one is terminated. Algorithms used by the network to decide the fraction of cells of each stream assigned to each cell loss priority level, along with a simple mechanism to enforce the desired priority assignment and a real-time admission control algorithm, with decision time of very few milliseconds even for thousands of heterogeneous sources are presented.},

abstract={In multimedia, multiparty communications a typical participant receives and often generates multiple real-time streams. Network resources are dedicated to each stream and are dynamically allocated and released in response to changing users demands throughout the session. Admission control procedures, which prioritize users' requests for stream delivery, and decide which resources to allocate, are considered. Existing admission control schemes base their decisions on resources that are unused at the time of the request, and reject a request (or queue it) if there are insufficient unused resources. The paper presents a novel approach in which admission is based not only on the unused resources but also on the resources occupied by the streams that are currently received by the requestor. If sufficient unused resources to deliver a requested stream are not available, other streams that are delivered to the requestor are preempted and the resources they occupy are reallocated to satisfy the new request. The manner by which candidate streams for preemption are identified and resources are reallocated depends on the relative importance of the streams to the recipient and the topology of the paths leading to it. The effect of the routing used by the network on the topology of the paths leading to a multi-stream receiver is discussed and protocols for preemption-based reallocation are presented.},

abstract={Presents a method to establish real-time connections with guaranteed quality-of-services, based on per-session (/spl sigma/,/spl rho/)-characterization. Under two distinctive service disciplines, rate proportional processor sharing and fixed rate processor sharing, the authors derive tighter probabilistic bounds on per-session end-to-end overage cell loss rate, which is caused by either buffer overflow in the route or excessive delay at the destination. One remarkable feature of the bounding solutions is that they are solely determined by the probabilistic (/spl sigma/,/spl rho/) characterization of each session itself, independent of the network environment and other connections. To improve network resource utilization, the method is extended to allow statistical sharing of buffer resources at each node. The admission control scheme presented in the paper has a great flexibility in connection management since both bandwidth and buffer resources can be adaptively allocated among incoming and existing sessions according to present network resource availability. The (/spl sigma/,/spl rho/)-characterization strongly depends on traffic characteristics. The study of real multimedia traffic streams reveals the interrelationship among (/spl sigma/,/spl rho/)-characterization, traffic statistics and QOS constraint and also provides many engineering aspects of (/spl sigma/,/spl rho/)-characterization for connection management.},

This investigation is carried out in the context of an ATM network where network packets are of fixed size (cells), and the authors concentrate mostly on the impact of the application peak transmission rate. Varying this parameter for a given source while keeping network cell losses constant can translate into significant variation in the loss probability of application messages.

abstract={Continues a study of document marking to deter illicit dissemination. An experiment performed reveals that the distortion on the photocopy of a document is very different in the vertical and horizontal directions. This leads to the strategy that marks a text line both vertically using line shifting and horizontally using word shifting. A line that is marked is always accompanied by two unmarked control lines one above and one below. They are used to measure distortions in the vertical and horizontal directions in order to decide whether line or word shift should be detected. Line shifts are detected using a centroid method that bases its decision on the relative distance of line centroids. Word shifts are detected using a correlation method that treats a profile as a waveform and decides whether it originated from a waveform whose middle block has been shifted left or right. The maximum likelihood detectors for both methods are given.},

abstract={Usage-based pricing of offered traffic to a data network can be an effective technique for congestion control. To gain insight into the benefits usage-based pricing offers, the authors propose and study a simple model in which many users wish to transmit packets to a single-server queue. Based on the announced price per packet and the available quality of service (QoS) (e.g., mean delay), each user independently decides whether or not to transmit. Given statistical assumptions about the incoming traffic streams and the QoS as a function of offered load, the equilibrium relationship between price and QoS is determined by a fixed-point equation. The relationships among price, QoS, revenue, and server capacity are illustrated numerically, assuming a particular type of random user population. These examples indicate that adjusting the price to maximize revenue results in an efficient use of service capacity with an associated small mean delay.},

abstract={Numerous methods have been proposed to integrate real-time and non-real-time services of the timed-token medium access control (MAC) protocol. One of the key issues in tailoring the timed-token MAC protocol for real-time applications is the synchronous bandwidth allocation (SEA) problem whose objective is to meet both the protocol and deadline constraints. Several non-optimal local SEA schemes and an optimal global scheme have been proposed previously. Local SEA schemes use only information available locally to each node, and are thus preferred to global schemes because of their lower network-management overhead. Unfortunately it has been formally proved in Han et al. (1995) that there does not exist any optimal local SEA scheme. Chen et al. [1992] proposed the only-known optimal global SEA scheme which is based on an iterative approach. However, their algorithm may not terminate theoretically. The present authors give an optimal global SEA scheme of polynomial-time worst-case complexity.},

We present performance measures which assess the new access- and flow-control algorithm: (i) locality- only the sub-network containing conflicting traffic streams gets involved in the fairness regulation; (ii) scalability-the data-structure sizes used in the algorithm are a function of the switching node degree, and use constant space control signals of only a-bit (the ATM standard, for example, dedicates four bits in the header of each cell to generic flow-control); (iii) linear access-time measured by the "the maximal clique in the conflict-graph to which a node belongs", and a frequency which is inverse linear in this parameter (when the traffic pattern stabilizes).},

Our approach is based on statistical multiplexing of traffic within a traffic class by using a virtual path for the class and deterministic multiplexing of different virtual paths, and on providing dynamic bandwidth and reconfigurability through the virtual path concept depending on traffic load during the course of the day. We show that, for test problems based on realistic network data, our approach does between 6% to 20% better than a local shortest path heuristic in terms of network cost. We also show that considering network dynamism through variation of traffic during the course of a day by doing dynamic bandwidth and virtual path reconfiguration can save between 10% to 14% in network design costs compared to a static network based on maximum busy hour traffic.},

abstract={In a multi-channel photonic dual bus network, each unidirectional bus contains a number of channels (wavelengths) and the bus headend periodically generates fixed length slots on each of the channels. Generally, one channel called the control channel is used to carry signals and the others are data channels. Each station is equipped with one-fixed-transmitter and one fixed-receiver which are permanently tuned to the dedicated control channel, and n tunable-transmitters and m tunable-receivers are tunable over the entire wavelength range. For non-overlapping traffic in the network, the maximum network throughput will be achieved by applying the wavelength reusing concept. Given a set of serving traffic, a set of new traffic requests, and c data channels (wavelengths), the wavelength/receiver assignment problem ((n, m, c)-WRAP) is to assign a transmission wavelength and a receiver for each request such that the network throughput is maximized and the number of assigned wavelengths is minimized. In this paper, we prove that the (n, m, c)-WRAP is NP-hard. An efficient distributed tunable-channel access protocol (DTCAP) is proposed for the (1, m, c)-WRAP. Based on the DTCAP, three different schemes are proposed for assigning the wavelength/receiver. The performance of the three proposed schemes on the DTCAP are evaluated and compared by simulation. Simulation results demonstrate that for a limited number of wavelengths and receivers, the proposed schemes substantially improve the network throughput and access delay under general traffic demands.},

abstract={In wavelength-division-multiplexed ring and bus networks, stations normally connect to the fiber using fused biconical taper (FBT) attachments. In this paper, we investigate protocols for multichannel photonic bus/ring LANs which use active wavelength-selective taps rather than passive ones. Since stations actively tap the channel that they are accessing, synchronization and other functions are identical to existing single-channel LANs. However, in order to avoid "re-tuning collisions", the media access protocols in these designs must ensure that stations do not re-tune their couplers at inappropriate times. This constraint places restrictions on the physical parameters over which system performance is efficient. In particular, we find that these designs may be efficient in the local area but lack the scalability required for metropolitan coverage. In this paper, capacity and delay models are also derived, and comparisons are made with conventional passive networks.},

abstract={This paper studies the variation on the power budget, in an infrared optical link for indoor channels with multipath propagation. The multipath propagation produces heavy distortion over the received signal and reduces the maximum baud rate for a given bit error rate. Focusing on IR wireless local area network (IRWLAN), we study some emitter and receiver configurations. In order to allow computer portability these links can be diffuse or quasi-diffuse. These channels do not rely upon the line-of-the-sight path. This works deals not only with the total received power, but with its time and spatial distribution. This paper considers the channel as characterized by its channel transfer function in a deterministic way. This is a good approximation if the variations in the environmental conditions are slow enough compared with the baud rate of the communication system. The source is an IR emitter diode (IRED) with different values of directivity, pointing to a reflecting surface, while the receiver is a photodiode characterized through its field of view (F.O.V.) value. The results show that an optical Q-diffuse link improves the performances of a diffuse one. We use for the comparative analysis the RMS spread delay of the impulse response, the spatial distribution of received power and its standard deviation from the mean. We present extensive simulation results, an emitter configuration and the first measured results obtained using an APD as receiver.},
