abstract={Input buffered switch architecture has become attractive for implementing high performance routers, and expanding use of the Internet sees an increasing need for quality of service. It is challenging to provide a scheduling technique that is both highly efficient and fair in resource allocation. We first introduce an iterative fair scheduling (iFS) scheme for input buffered switches that supports fair bandwidth distribution among the flows and achieves asymptotically 100% throughput. The iFS is evaluated both under synthetic workload and with Web traces from the Internet. Compared to the commonly used synthetic input, our simulation results reveal significant difference in performance when real network traffic is employed. We then consider fair scheduling under various buffer management mechanisms and analyze their impact on the fairness in bandwidth allocation. Our studies indicate that early packet discard in anticipation of congestion is necessary and per-flow based buffering is effective for protecting benign users from being adversely affected by misbehaved traffic. Buffer allocation according to bandwidth reservation is especially helpful when the input traffic is highly bursty.},

pages={1151-1159 vol.3},
abstract={Network calculus is known to apply in general only to feedforward routing networks, i.e., networks where routes do not create cycles of interdependent packet flows. We address the problem of using network calculus in networks of arbitrary topology. For this purpose, we introduce a novel algorithm, called turn-prohibition (TP), that breaks all the cycles in a network and thus prevents any interdependence between flows. We prove that the TP-algorithm prohibits the use of at most 1/3 of the total number turns in a network, for any network topology. Using analysis and simulation, we show that the TP-algorithm significantly outperforms other approaches for breaking cycles, such as the spanning tree and up/down routing algorithms, in terms of network utilization and delay bounds. Our simulation results also show that the network utilization achieved with the TP-algorithm is within a factor of two of the maximum theoretical network utilization, for networks of up to 50 nodes of degree four. Thus, in many practical cases, the restriction of network calculus to feed-forward routing networks may not represent a significant limitation.},

title={Towards simple, high-performance schedulers for high-aggregate bandwidth switches},
year={2002},
volume={3},

pages={1160-1169 vol.3},
abstract={High-aggregate bandwidth switches are those whose port count multiplied by the operating line rate is very high; for example, a 30 port switch operating at 40 Gbps or a 1000 port switch operating at 1 Gbps. Designing high-performance schedulers for such switches is challenging for the following reasons: (i) high performance requires finding good matchings; (ii) good matchings take time to find; (iii) in high-aggregate bandwidth switches there is either too little time (due to high line rates) or there is too much work to do (due to a high port count). We exploit the following features of the switching problem to devise simple-to-implement, high-performance schedulers: (a) the state of the switch (carried in the lengths of its queues) changes slowly with time, implying that heavy matchings will likely stay heavy over a period of time; (b) observing arriving packets conveys useful information about the state of the switch. These features are exploited using hardware parallelism and randomization to yield three scheduling algorithms for IQ (input-queued) switches - APSARA, LAURA and SERENA. These algorithms are shown to achieve 100% throughput and simulations show that their delay performance is quite competitive with respect to the maximum weight matching. The stability proof involves a derandomization procedure and uses methods which may have wider applicability.},

abstract={This paper explores, primarily by means of analysis, the differences that can exist between individual and aggregate loss guarantees in an environment where guarantees are only provided at an aggregate level. The focus is on understanding which traffic parameters are responsible for inducing possible deviations and to what extent. In addition, we seek to evaluate the level of additional resources, e.g., bandwidth or buffer, required to ensure that all individual loss measures remain below their desired target. The paper's contributions are in developing analytical models that enable the evaluation of individual loss probabilities in settings where only aggregate losses are controlled, and in identifying traffic parameters that play a dominant role in causing differences between individual and aggregate losses. The latter allows the construction of guidelines identifying what kind of traffic can be safely multiplexed into a common service class.},

pages={1180-1189 vol.3},
abstract={Group communication has become increasingly important in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). Current multicast routing protocols in MANET have a large overhead due to the dynamic network topology. To overcome this problem, there is a recent shift towards stateless multicast in small groups. We introduce a small group multicast scheme, based on packet encapsulation, which uses a novel packet distribution tree construction algorithms for efficient data delivery. The tree is constructed with the goal of minimizing the overall bandwidth cost of the tree. Two construction algorithms, for a location-guided k-ary (LGK) tree and a location-guided Steiner (LGS) tree, utilize the geometric locations of the destination nodes as heuristics to compute the trees. They are accompanied by a hybrid location update mechanism to disseminate location information among a group of nodes. Our simulation results show that LGS tree has lower bandwidth cost than LGK tree when the location information of the nodes is up-to-date, and its cost is similar to that of an optimal Steiner multicast tree. When location information of the nodes is out-dated, LGK tree outperforms LGS tree due to its lower computational complexity.},

year={2002},
volume={3},

pages={1190-1199 vol.3},
abstract={A number of large-scale distributed Internet applications could potentially benefit from some level of knowledge about the relative proximity between its participating host nodes. For example, the performance of large overlay networks could be improved if the application-level connectivity between the nodes in these networks is congruent with the underlying IP-level topology. Similarly, in the case of replicated Web content, client nodes could use topological information in selecting one of multiple available servers. For such applications, one need not find the optimal solution in order to achieve significant practical benefits. Thus, these applications, and presumably others like them, do not require exact topological information and can instead use sufficiently informative hints about the relative positions of Internet hosts. In this paper, we present a binning scheme whereby nodes partition themselves into bins such that nodes that fall within a given bin are relatively close to one another in terms of network latency. Our binning strategy is simple (requiring minimal support from any measurement infrastructure), scalable (requiring no form of global knowledge, each node only needs knowledge of a small number of well-known landmark nodes) and completely distributed (requiring no communication or cooperation between the nodes being binned). We apply this binning strategy to the two applications mentioned above: overlay network construction and server selection. We test our binning strategy and its application using simulation and Internet measurement traces. Our results indicate that the performance of these applications can be significantly improved by even the rather coarse-grained knowledge of topology offered by our binning scheme.},

abstract={Multicast services can be provided either as a basic network service or as an application-layer service. Higher level multicast implementations often provide more sophisticated features, and can provide multicast services, where no network layer support is available. Overlay multicast networks offer an intermediate option, potentially combining the flexibility and advanced features of application layer multicast with the greater efficiency of network layer multicast. Overlay multicast networks play an important role in the Internet. Indeed, since Internet service providers have been slow to enable IP multicast in their networks, Internet multicast is only widely available as an overlay service. This paper introduces several routing algorithms that are suitable for overlay multicast networks and evaluates their performance. The algorithms seek to optimize the end-to-end delay and the interface bandwidth usage at the routing sites within the overlay network. The interface bandwidth is typically a key resource for an overlay network provider, and needs to be carefully managed in order to maximize the number of sessions that can be served. The simultaneous optimization of both delay and bandwidth is an NP-hard problem. We propose several heuristic algorithms and simulate their performance under various traffic conditions and on various network topologies.},

abstract={This paper contains a detailed description of the congestion control algorithm of TRAM, a tree-based reliable multicast protocol. This algorithm takes advantage of regular acknowledgements from the receivers that propagate back to the sender via the repair tree. This scalable feedback mechanism is used to collect receiver credits. Complementing the windowing mechanism, packet transmission is smoothed by using a data rate commensurate with the window size. Additional details, such as how to prune slow receivers, and how to implement the rate scheduler on non-real-time systems are also discussed. The performance of the congestion control algorithm is then evaluated in extended LANs, and wide area networks. The fairness of bandwidth-sharing with other (TCP) traffic is also evaluated.},

abstract={This paper sketches the design of NLS, a scalable naming and location service, and presents an analysis and evaluation of its scalability. NLS resolves textual names to a nearby instance of a set of replicated objects associated with that name, and is designed to scale to the dimensions of a world-wide service. Applications include resolving Web URIs (uniform resource identifiers) to the nearest cached or replicated objects that provide the associated content. The key design goals of NLS are scalability, performance, availability and ease of administration. NLS is based on a dynamically configured, distributed search tree, with a fat-tree based topology at the global layer and spanning trees at the local layer. Analysis and preliminary empirical results obtained with a prototype implementation indicate that the system scales as expected.},

pages={1228-1237 vol.3},
abstract={Efficient data retrieval in a peer-to-peer system like Freenet is a challenging problem. We study the impact of cache replacement policy on the performance of Freenet. We find that, with Freenet's LRU (least recently used) cache replacement, there is a steep reduction in the hit ratio with increasing load. Based on intuition from the small-world models and the recent theoretical results by Kleinberg, we propose an enhanced-clustering cache replacement scheme for use in place of LRU. Such a replacement scheme forces the routing tables to resemble neighbor relationships in a small-world acquaintance graph - clustering with light randomness. In our simulation, this new scheme improved the request hit ratio dramatically while keeping the small average hops per successful request comparable to LRU. A simple, highly idealized model of Freenet under clustering with light randomness proves that the expected message delivery time in Freenet is O(log/sup 2/n) if the routing tables satisfy the small-world model and have the size /spl theta/(log/sup 2/n).},

pages={1238-1247 vol.3},
abstract={Caching is a popular technique for reducing both server load and user response time in distributed systems. We consider the question of whether caching might be effective for search engines as well. We study two real search engine traces by examining query locality and its implications for caching. Our trace analysis produced three results. One result shows that queries have significant locality, with query frequency following a Zipf distribution. Very popular queries are shared among different users and can be cached at servers or proxies, while 16% to 22% of the queries are from the same users and should be cached at the user side. Multiple-word queries are shared less and should be cached mainly at the user side. Another result shows that if caching is to be done at the user side, short-term caching for hours is enough to cover query temporal locality, while server/proxy caching should use longer periods, such as days. The third result showed that most users have small lexicons when submitting queries. Frequent users who submit many search requests tend to reuse a small subset of words to form queries. Thus, with proxy or user side caching, prefetching based on the user lexicon looks promising.},

abstract={Several routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks work efficiently only in bidirectional networks. Unidirectional links may exist in a real network due to variations in transmission power of different nodes, noise or other signal propagation phenomena, and heterogeneity in the transmission hardware of nodes in the network. We introduce a sub-layer called sub routing layer, SRL, between the network and the MAC layer to provide a bidirectional abstraction of the unidirectional network to the routing protocols. We present a scalable and efficient way to provide this abstraction by finding and maintaining multi-hop reverse routes to each unidirectional link. We simulate SRL and a modified version of AODV (ad hoc on demand distance vector) that uses SRL to route packets in a unidirectional network. We observed that with SRL, the packet delivery of AODV in unidirectional networks increases substantially. Further our simulations indicate that reverse routes are often only a few hops long and hence the overhead of using SRL is very low.},

pages={1268-1277 vol.3},
abstract={Several localized routing protocols (see Bose, P. and Morin, P., Proc. 10th Annual Int. Symp. on Algorithms and Computation ISAAC, 1999) guarantee the delivery of packets when the underlying network topology is the Delaunay triangulation of all wireless nodes. However, it is expensive to construct the Delaunay triangulation in a distributed manner. Given a set of wireless nodes, we more accurately model the network as a unit-disk graph, UDG, in which a link between two nodes exists only if the distance between them is at most the maximum transmission range. Given a graph H, a spanning subgraph G of H is a t-spanner if the length of the shortest path connecting any two points in G is no more than t times the length of the shortest path connecting the two points in H. We present a novel localized networking protocol that constructs a planar 2.5-spanner of UDG, called the localized Delaunay triangulation, as network topology. It contains all edges that are in both the UDG and the Delaunay triangulation of all wireless nodes. Our experiments show that the delivery rates of existing localized routing protocols are increased when localized Delaunay triangulation is used instead of several previously proposed topologies. The total communication cost of our networking protocol is O(n log n) bits. Moreover, the computation cost of each node u is O(d/sub u/ log d/sub u/), where d/sub u/ is the number of 1-hop neighbors of u in UDG.},

The low per-node cost will allow these wireless networks of sensors and actuators to be densely distributed. The nodes in these dense networks will coordinate to perform the distributed sensing tasks. Moreover, as described in this paper, the nodes can also coordinate to exploit the redundancy provided by high density, so as to extend overall system lifetime. The large number of nodes deployed in these systems will preclude manual configuration, and the environmental dynamics will preclude design-time pre-configuration. Therefore, nodes will have to self-configure to establish a topology that provides communication and sensing coverage under stringent energy constraints. In ASCENT, each node assesses its connectivity and adapts its participation in the multi-hop network topology based on the measured operating region. This paper motivates and describes the ASCENT algorithm and presents simulation and experimental measurements.},

abstract={In the context of heterogeneous networks and diverse communication devices, real person-to-person communications can be achieved with a universal personal identification (UPI) that uniquely identifies an individual and is independent of the access networks and communication devices. Hierarchical mobility management techniques (MMT) have been proposed to support UPI. Previously proposed profile replication algorithms for improving the performance of such MMT are either threshold-based or off-line. In contrast to an off-line algorithm that assumes perfect knowledge of user calling and mobility statistics, we propose in this paper on-line replication algorithms that decide whether to distribute new replicas or delete existing replicas after serving each request, all based on the input sequence seen so far. The performance of our on-line profile replication algorithms is studied via large scale network simulations.},

abstract={We use recent advances from the theory of multivariate stochastic orderings to formalize the "folk theorem" to the effect that positive correlations lead to increased buffer occupancy and larger buffer levels at a discrete-time infinite capacity multiplexer queue. Input sequences are compared in the supermodular (sm) ordering and buffer contents in the increasing convex (icx) ordering, respectively. Three popular classes of (discrete-time) traffic models are discussed, namely the fractional Gaussian noise traffic model, the on-off source model and the M|G|/spl infin/ traffic model. The independent version of an input process in each of these classes of traffic models is a member of the same class. In varying degree of generality, we show that this independent version is smaller than the input sequence itself, and that the corresponding buffer content processes are similarly ordered.},

pages={1307-1315 vol.3},
abstract={A message (or a frame) is a group of consecutive packets (or cells in ATM terminology). Often a loss of one packet from the message can result in the loss of the whole message. Selective message discarding policies have been proposed to achieve the twin goal of increased goodput and reduced network congestion by discarding the packets which do not belong to (or have potential of not belonging to) good messages. In this paper we provide a fluid analysis of early message discard. We obtain approximations for performance metrics which are valid for heavy traffic conditions. In particular, we obtain exact expressions for the distribution of the stationary workload process and the fluid goodput ratio. Our analytical results will be quite helpful in selecting an optimal discarding threshold, in studying the sensitivity of goodput ratio to different parameters and also in problems related to buffer and/or capacity dimensioning to achieve a desired quality of service.},

This result provides a new tool for analyzing network congestion points with moderately heavy-tailed characteristics, e.g. log normal distributions, that have been recently empirically discovered in Web traffic.

abstract={Several recent studies have proposed methods to accelerate the receipt of a file by downloading its parts from different servers in parallel. This paper formulates models for an approach based on receiving only one copy of each of the data packets in a file, while different packets may be obtained from different sources. This approach guarantees faster downloads with lower network use. However, out-of-order arrivals at the receiving side are unavoidable. We present methods to keep out-of-order low to insure more regulated flow of packets to the application. Recent papers indicate that out-of-order arrivals have many unfavorable consequences. A good indicator to the severeness of out-of-order arrival is the resequencing-buffer occupancy. The paper focuses on the analysis of the resequencing-buffer occupancy distribution and on the analysis of the methods used to reduce the occupancy of the buffer.},

abstract={We present the design, implementation, and performance analysis of group-aided multicast (GAM), a scalable many-to-many reliable multicast transport protocol. GAM achieves high quality ACK trees while keeping the tree maintenance overhead reasonably low in the presence of dynamic group membership and route changes. It is supported by a group configuration mechanism organizing the members in a multicast session into multiple small groups and a tree configuration mechanism maintaining logical trees according to the underlying multicast routing trees. With the two mechanisms, GAM builds a two-layer hierarchy of multi-level logical trees from which high-quality per-source ACK trees are generated. Simulation results show that the GAM protocol is more scalable than a NACK suppression protocol in terms of processing time for request/repair messages and recovery latency.},

pages={1346-1355 vol.3},
abstract={Many protocols and applications need a discovery mechanism to enable a given client node to locate one or several specific nodes involved in the same communication. However, there is no protocol ready to fulfill this service at the network layer. Every protocol usually implements its own solution. In particular, multicast protocols often use a search technique called expanding ring search. This method searches for those specific nodes in all directions and thus uses much bandwidth. However, a typical search can usually restrict its scan in a specific direction. To answer this problem, we propose a network layer search service in replacement of the expanding ring search whenever it is appropriate. This service is based on an oriented multicasting protocol in order to ensure an efficiency higher than the expanding ring search. The oriented multicasting principle is to channel the multicasting of search packets towards a special node, involved in the communication, in order to scan only a limited area. We describe both the network layer search service and the oriented multicasting and we provide comparative simulation results between our service and the expanding ring search.},

abstract={Scalable reliable multicast protocols have been the focus of recent research, tackling the problem of efficient reliable data delivery to an arbitrarily large number of receivers. Yet, the common applications of multicast, such as multi-point file delivery, or video streaming from a media server, typically only involve a moderate number of receivers, such as a thousand or fewer. Moreover, because of the limited deployment of these specialized multicast protocols, it is common, when feasible, for applications to use multiple TCP connections instead, one for each receiver, to implement multi-point delivery, causing a significant demand on the transmission server and the downstream links. We describe a multicast extension to TCP, called single-source multicast optimization (SMO), that optimizes this case of multipoint delivery, providing the benefits of multicast together with the familiar features and API of TCP. Our results from experiments based on a Linux implementation and performed on a testbed show that TCP-SMO requires just a modest extension to the TCP implementation and provides scalable performance of multicast up to over a thousand receivers, thereby satisfying the common case requirements. In addition, used with TCP-RTM (real-time mode), TCP-SMO also supports real-time multimedia multicast applications well.},

abstract={While the advantages of multicast delivery over multiple unicast deliveries is undeniable, the deployment of the IP multicast protocol has been limited to "islands" of network domains under single administrative control. Deployment of inter-domain multicast delivery has been slow due to both technical and administrative reasons. In this paper we propose a Host Multicast Tree Protocol (HMTP) that (1) automates the interconnection of IP-multicast enabled islands and (2) provides multicast delivery to end hosts where IP multicast is not available. With HMTP, end-hosts and proxy gateways of IP multicast-enabled islands can dynamically create shared multicast trees across different islands. Members of an HMTP multicast group self-organize into an efficient, scalable and robust multicast tree. The tree structure is adjusted periodically to accommodate changes in group membership and network topology. Simulation results show that the multicast tree has low cost, and data delivered over it experiences moderately low latency.},

abstract={The increasing popularity of wireless broadband access in local and wide area networks is the main expression of the need for flexible and ubiquitous wireless connectivity. In order to satisfy user resource requirements in the presence of volatility of the wireless medium, sophisticated multiple access and adaptation techniques are required, which alleviate channel impairments and increase system throughput. The use of multiple antennas at the base station allows intra-cell channel reuse by multiple spatially separable users through space division multiple access (SDMA) and hence enhances cell capacity. However, the employment of antennas in the physical layer raises significant issues in the medium access control (MAC) layer. We investigate the impact of antenna arrays on MAC layer channel allocation in the context of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which is the predominantly proposed signaling scheme for wireless broadband access. We propose an algorithm to allocate channels to users based on their spatial separability properties, while appropriately adjusting beamforming weights and transmission rates for each user in a channel. The unified consideration of such adaptive techniques yields significant throughput benefits.},

abstract={Intelligent mobile terminals (or users) of next generation wireless networks are expected to initiate voice over IP (VoIP) calls using session set-up protocols like H.323 or SIP (session initiation protocol). To guarantee service quality of such applications, the call set-up protocol should be robust against network impairment generated in wireless networks. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the H.323 call setup procedure over the wireless link. We used two call modes of operation for this analysis namely regular and fast connect. The proposed model assumes that a transparent radio link protocol (RLP), but without RLP retransmission, be used for VoIP packets while non-transparent (regular) RLP be used for H.323 control packets. Our analytical models prove that the VoIP call set-up performance can degrade significantly even for moderately high air-link frame error rates (FER). Furthermore, the call setup performance can be improved significantly using the robust radio link layer such as RLP with the modifications proposed in our paper. The analytical results were validated by our experimental measurements.},

year={2002},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1395-1404},
abstract={The majority of the existing ad hoc wireless network routing protocols has a tendency to use the shortest single path from the source to the destination. However, in constantly changing topologies such as those in mobile ad hoc networks, the shortest single path is quite unstable for reachability and also for traffic load equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called Applicative Indirect Routing (AIR), to control network traffic congestion and refine the route availability by coping with unreliable links quickly. The proposed scheme, acting as a proactive routing protocol, utilizes additional information about the neighbors shared (defined as proxies) by the sender and receiver to find ondemand an alternative for the original path with unreliable links. The additional bandwidth usage in AIR to obtain the information about shared neighbors is so minimal that the bandwidth availability for data packets is not significantly affected. In our scheme, it is possible for the nodes to dynamically reroute incoming packets into alternative paths so the packets will reach their destinations even when the ideal routing path fails. The conducted simulation experiments show that AIR leads to a much improved system performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end packet delay, and network reliability as compared with a conventional proactive protocol, namely Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV). AIR is also a competitive protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio as compared with two existing reactive protocols; namely Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR).},

abstract={We investigate efficient schemes for data communication from a server to a mobile terminal over a wireless channel of fluctuating quality. A user requests to access various data items on the terminal. If a requested item is found in the local terminal buffer or cache, no access delay is incurred. If not, it is downloaded from the server and the user incurs a delay cost until it becomes locally available. Moreover, a power cost is incurred to transmit the data item at a selected power level over the wireless link. To lower both the average delay and power costs, the system may prefetch data items and predictively cache them on the terminal - especially during link quality 'highs' - in anticipation of future user requests. The goal is to minimize the overall delay and power cost, by judiciously choosing which data item to fetch and what power level to use, given the current user, buffer, and channel states. We develop a modeling framework - based on controlled Markov chains and dynamic programming - capturing the essential performance tradeoffs in the system and allowing computation of optimal decisions on items to (pre)fetch and power levels to use. To cope with emerging complexities, we then design efficient heuristics, whose simulation analysis demonstrates substantial performance gains over standard approaches.},

abstract={An important goal of the design of WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) networks is to use less wavelengths to serve more communication needs. According to the wavelength conflict rule, we know that the number of wavelengths required in a WDM network is at least equal to the maximal number of channels over a fiber (called maximal link load) in the network. By placing wavelength converters at some nodes in the network, the number of wavelengths needed can be made equal to the maximal link load. In this paper we study the problem of placing the minimal number of converters in a network to achieve that the number of wavelengths in use is equal to the maximal link load. For duplex communication channels, we prove that an optimal solution can be obtained in polynomial-time. For unidirectional communication channels, which was proved to be NP-complete, we develop a set of lemmas which lead to an efficient approximation algorithm whose approximation ratio is two.},

abstract={Metropolitan WDM networks play an important role in the emerging Internet hierarchy; they interconnect the backbone WDM networks and the local access networks. The current SONET/SDH-over-WDM-ring metropolitan networks are expected to become a serious bottleneck - the so-called metropolitan gap-as they are faced with an increasing amount of bursty data traffic and quickly increasing bandwidths in the backbone networks and access networks. Innovative metropolitan WDM networks that are highly efficient and able to handle variable-size packets are needed to alleviate the metropolitan gap. In this paper we study an AWG-based single-hop WDM metropolitan network. We analyze the photonic switching of variable-size packets with spatial wavelength reuse. We derive computationally efficient and accurate expressions for the network throughput and delay. Our extensive numerical investigations - based on our analytical results and simulations - reveal that spatial wavelength reuse is crucial for efficient photonic packet switching. In typical scenarios, spatial wavelength reuse increases the throughput by 60% while reducing the delay by 40%.},

pages={1442-1450 vol.3},
abstract={We study routing and wavelength assignment for a circuit-switched time division multiplexed (TDM) wavelength-routed (WR) optical WDM network. In a conventional WR network, an entire wavelength is assigned to a given session (or circuit). This can lead to lower channel utilization when the individual sessions do not need the entire channel bandwidth. We consider a TDM-based approach to reduce this inefficiency. In this architecture, each wavelength is partitioned in the time-domain into fixed-length time-slots organized as a TDM frame. Multiple sessions are multiplexed on each wavelength by assigning a sub-set of the TDM slots to each session. Thus, given a session request with a specified bandwidth, the goal is to determine the route, wavelength and time-slot assignment (RWTA) that meets the request. This is similar to routing and wavelength assignment in WR networks. We present a family of RWTA algorithms and study the blocking performance. We use the existing shortest-path routing algorithm with a new link cost function, least resistance weight (LRW) function, that incorporates wavelength utilization information. We employ the known least loaded (LL) wavelength selection and present three variations of the least-loaded time-slot (LLT) algorithm. Simulation based analyses are used to compare the proposed TDM architecture to traditional WR networks, both with and without wavelength conversion. The goal is to compare the benefits of TDM and wavelength conversion towards improving performance in WR networks. The results show that the use of TDM provides substantial gains, especially for multi-fiber networks.},

abstract={We consider power and server allocation in a multi-beam satellite downlink which transmits data to N different ground locations over N time-varying channels. Packets destined for each ground location are stored in separate queues, and the server rate for each queue i depends on the power p/sub i/(t) allocated to that server and the channel state c/sub i/(t) according to a concave rate-power curve /spl mu//sub i/(p/sub i/, c/sub i/). We establish the capacity region of all arrival rate vectors which admit a stabilizable system. For the case when channel states and arrivals are iid from timeslot to timeslot, we develop a particular power allocation policy which stabilizes the system whenever the rate vector lies within the capacity region. Such stability is guaranteed even if the channel model and the specific arrival rates are unknown. As a special case, this analysis verifies the stability of the "choose-the-K-largest-connected-queues" policy when channels can be in one of two states (ON or OFF) and K servers are allocated at every timestep (K<N). These results are extended to treat a joint problem of routing and power allocation, and a throughput maximizing algorithm for this joint problem is constructed. Finally, we address the issue of interchannel interference, and develop a modified policy when power vectors are constrained to feasible activation sets. Our analysis and problem formulation is also applicable to power control for wireless systems.},

abstract={Third generation (3G) mobile communication systems are intended to provide enhanced high-speed data, multimedia, and voice services to mobile users. Beamforming techniques have been proposed to increase the spectral efficiency of the wireless channel. In a commercially deployed 3G system, it is likely that these techniques will coexist with resource management. Resource management in a wireless system should take care of channel impairments and non-ideal antenna patterns. Mobile users moving from one beam to another give rise to resource reallocation issues. We propose a resource allocation and management scheme tailored to systems with smart antennas supporting heterogeneous users. The algorithm works by comparing the received power in each beam. Elasticity of user requirements for data services is exploited to provide adaptive QoS to the users, thereby preventing dropping of a call due to user mobility. Simulation results showing the channel and MAI effects on system performance are presented. The throughput advantage obtained using the management scheme is compared to a system without resource management. It is also seen that the throughput of the system increases for a user population exhibiting higher elasticity. In addition, the algorithm can be modified to handle call hand-off as well.},

abstract={This paper considers resource allocation and pricing for the downlink of a wireless network. We describe a model that applies to either a time-slotted system (e.g. Qualcomm's HDR proposal) or a CDMA system; the main feature of this model is that the channel quality varies across the users. We study using a pricing scheme for the allocation of radio resources. We show that to maximize revenue in such a system, the base station should allocate resources in a discriminatory manner, where different users are charged different prices based in part on their channel quality. However, optimally allocating resources in this way is shown to require knowledge about each user's utility function. We consider a suboptimal scheme which does not require knowledge of the users' utility functions, and show that this scheme is asymptotically optimal, in the limit of large demand. Moreover, such a scheme is shown to maximize social welfare. We also consider a heuristic scheme for the case of small demand, which does not require perfect knowledge about the users' utility functions. We provide numerical results that illustrate the performance of this heuristic.},

pages={1480-1489 vol.3},
abstract={We use a utility based power allocation framework in the downlink to treat multi-class CDMA wireless services in a unified way. Our goal is to obtain a power allocation which maximizes the total system utility. Natural utility functions for each mobile are non-concave. Hence we cannot use existing techniques on convex optimization problems to derive a social optimal solution. We propose a simple distributed algorithm to obtain an approximation to the social optimal power allocation. The algorithm is based on dynamic pricing and allows partial cooperation between mobiles and the base station. The algorithm consists of two stages. At the first stage, the base station selects mobiles to which power is allocated, considering their partial-cooperative nature. This is called partial-cooperative optimal selection, since in a partial-cooperative setting and pricing scheme, this selection is optimal and satisfies system feasibility. At the next stage, the base station allocates power to the selected mobiles. This power allocation is a social optimal power allocation among mobiles in the partial-cooperative optimal selection, thus, we call it a partial-cooperative optimal power allocation. We compare the partial-cooperative optimal power allocation with the social optimal power allocation for the single class case. From these results, we infer that the system utility obtained by partial-cooperative optimal power allocation is quite close to the system utility obtained by social optimal allocation.},

abstract={Dedicated infrastructures for end-to-end measurements are complex to deploy and manage. Equipment cost, the requirements for reporting bandwidth, and the administrative diversity of the Internet, are factors that potentially hamper scalability. This paper describes the architecture and implementation of an alternative approach in which the end-to-end probing and measurement reporting functions are embedded in a transport protocol, namely RTP (real-time transport protocol). Suitably enabled hosts in a multicast group are effectively co-opted to form an impromptu measurement infrastructure. Coupled with our previous work on multicast-based inference (see Adams, A. et al., IEEE Commun. Magazine, 2000), this enables the determination of the performance characteristics of internal network links of very large multicast distribution trees. Our experimental results show that an accuracy of about 1 part in 10 is attainable when inferring link loss rates in the 1% to 10% range, down to 1 part in 3 for loss rates down to 0.1%, this for probes generated by a regular audio source over a few hundred seconds.},

abstract={The increasing presence of UDP traffic in the Internet and the emergence of sensing applications which do not require full reliability motivates the search for a robust acknowledgement scheme for unreliable flows. TCP-styled cumulative ack relies on the eventual retransmission of all lost packets and hence cannot be used for unreliable flows. Our contribution is the design and analysis of a simple, yet robust acknowledgement scheme for unreliable flows. We show that our scheme achieves good performance even when the actual network conditions deviate from the designer's estimate. It works in networks having orders of magnitude difference in bandwidth and loss probability, with little variation of overhead and no change to the algorithms.},

abstract={Modern personal digital assistant (PDA) architectures often utilize a wholesale data transfer protocol known as "slow sync" for synchronizing PDAs with personal computers (PCs). This approach is markedly inefficient with respect to bandwidth usage and latency, since the PDA and PC typically share many common records. We propose, analyze, and implement a novel PDA synchronization scheme (CPIsync - characteristic polynomial interpolation-based synchronization) predicated upon recent information-theoretic research. The salient property of this scheme is that its communication complexity depends on the number of differences between the PDA and PC, and is essentially independent of the overall number of records. Moreover, our implementation shows that the computational complexity of CPIsync is practical, and that the overall latency is typically much smaller than that of slow sync. Thus, CPIsync has potential for significantly improving synchronization protocols for PDAs and, more generally, for heterogeneous networks of many machines.},

year={2002},
volume={3},

pages={1520-1529 vol.3},
abstract={Layered transmission has been proposed as a solution to video multicast over the Internet. Existing protocols usually perform adaptation at the receiver and use static rate allocation techniques at the sender. As a result, significant mismatches between the fixed transmission rates and the heterogeneous and dynamic rate requirements for the receivers can occur. We show that such mismatches can be minimized by employing dynamic layer rate allocation at the sender by taking advantage of the recent development in layered video coding. Specifically, we study the optimization criteria for layer rate allocation, and propose a metric, called fairness index, which fairly reflects the degree of a receiver's satisfaction. We then formulate this into an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the expected fairness index, and derive an efficient and scalable algorithm to solve it. We further demonstrate that such sender rate adaptation can be seamlessly integrated into an end-to-end adaptation protocol called HALM (hybrid adaptation layered multicast). This protocol is designed for the current best-effort Internet and is TCP-friendly. Its control overhead is also kept at a low level. Simulation results show that HALM improves the degree of fairness for receivers with heterogeneous bandwidth requirements, and interacts with TCP flows substantially better than static allocation based protocols. In addition, increasing the number of layers in HALM always leads to a higher degree of fairness and 3 to 5 layers are usually sufficient. However, this is not true for the static allocation based protocols.},

pages={1530-1539},
abstract={We propose a simple and robust mechanism for detecting SYN flooding attacks. Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.},

abstract={Multicast and anycast have received considerable attention due to their ability to support networked services. There are distinct and significant security vulnerabilities in both the multicast and anycast model including denial of service, theft or service, eavesdropping, and masquerading. The multicast problem requires a secure IGMP. The anycast problem requires secure anycast server advertisements. We generalize these two problems into a problem of group access control and propose Gothic, a complete architecture for providing group access control. Gothic centers around a novel authorization architecture. This is complemented by a proposal for a group policy management system that allows the group owner to be authenticated before being allowed to specify the group access rights. This system can be applied to other works that involve group policy. We show how Gothic operates in a number of environments including application-layer multicast, source-specific multicast, application-layer anycast and global IP-anycast. We evaluate the security and scalability of the architecture and show that it improves scalability over previous solutions while maintaining or increasing the level of security. We also propose methods of integrating Gothic with the group key management system and content distribution tree. We propose and evaluate a group access control aware group key management technique that leverages the existence of a group access control system to substantially reduce overhead.},

abstract={Forcing all IP packets to carry correct source addresses can greatly help network security, attack tracing, and network problem debugging. However, due to asymmetries in today's Internet routing, routers do not have readily available information to verify the correctness of the source address for each incoming packet. In this paper we describe a new protocol, named SAVE, that can provide routers with the information needed for source address validation. SAVE messages propagate valid source address information from the source location to all destinations, allowing each router along the way to build an incoming table that associates each incoming interface of the router with a set of valid source address blocks. This paper presents the protocol design and evaluates its correctness and performance by simulation experiments. The paper also discusses the issues of protocol security, the effectiveness of partial SAVE deployment, and the handling of unconventional forms of network routing, such as mobile IP and tunneling.},

year={2002},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1567-1576 vol.3},
abstract={This paper proposes S-MAC, a medium-access control (MAC) protocol designed for wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with individual nodes remaining largely inactive for long periods of time, but then becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in almost every way: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses three novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. To reduce energy consumption in listening to an idle channel, nodes periodically sleep. Neighboring nodes form virtual clusters to auto-synchronize on sleep schedules. Inspired by PAMAS, S-MAC also sets the radio to sleep during transmissions of other nodes. Unlike PAMAS, it only uses in-channel signaling. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for sensor-network applications that require store-and-forward processing as data move through the network. We evaluate our implementation of S-MAC over a sample sensor node, the Mote, developed at University of California, Berkeley. The experiment results show that, on a source node, an 802.11-like MAC consumes 2-6 times more energy than S-MAC for traffic load with messages sent every 1-10 s.},

abstract={Gupta and Kumar (see IEEE Transactions an Information Theory, vol.46, no.2, p.388-404, 2000) determined the capacity of wireless networks under certain assumptions, among them point-to-point coding, which excludes for example multi-access and broadcast codes. We consider essentially the same physical model of a wireless network under a different traffic pattern, namely the relay traffic pattern, but we allow for arbitrarily complex network coding. In our model, there is only one active source/destination pair, while all other nodes assist this transmission. We show code constructions leading to achievable rates and derive upper bounds from the max-flow min-cut theorem. It is shown that lower and upper bounds meet asymptotically as the number of nodes in the network goes to infinity, thus proving that the capacity of the wireless network with n nodes under the relay traffic pattern behaves like log n bits per second. This demonstrates also that network coding is essential: under the point-to-point coding assumption considered by Gupta et al., the achievable rate is constant, independent of the number of nodes. Moreover, the result of this paper has implications' and extensions to fading channels and to sensor networks.},

None of these algorithms have constant approximation factors. Thus these algorithms can not guarantee to generate a CDS of small size. Their message complexities can be as high as O(n/sup 2/), and their time complexities may also be as large as O(n/sup 2/) and O(n/sup 3/). We then present our own distributed algorithm that outperforms the existing algorithms. This algorithm has an approximation factor of at most 8, O(n) time complexity and O(n log n) message complexity. By establishing the /spl Omega/(n log n) lower bound on the message complexity of any distributed algorithm for nontrivial CDS, our algorithm is thus message-optimal.},

abstract={Many studies provide an extended investigation of the maximum throughput achievable in input-queueing (IQ) or combined-input-and-output-queueing (CIOQ) packet switches. Some scheduling policies, among which are maximum weight matching algorithms, were identified as optimal, in the sense that they were proved to achieve 100% throughput under any admissible single-class traffic pattern. Most of the results in the literature, however, consider just one switch in isolation, operating on packets belonging to a single traffic class. In this paper we first generalize known results, showing that a wide class of IQ schedulers operating on multiple traffic classes can achieve 100% throughput. In addition, we address the problem of the maximum throughput achievable in a network of interconnected IQ switches loaded by multiclass traffic, and we devise some simple scheduling policies that guarantee 100% throughput when switches are interconnected in a network. Both the Lyapunov function methodology and the fluid models approach are used to obtain our results.},

abstract={Output queued switches are appealing because they have better latency and throughput than input queued switches. However, they are difficult to build: a direct implementation of an N/spl times/N output-queued switch requires the switching fabric and the packet memories at the outputs to run at N times the line rate. Attempts have been made to implement output queuing with slow components, e.g., by having memories at both inputs and outputs running at twice the line rate. In these approaches, even though the packet memory speed is reduced, the scheduler time complexity is high - at least /spl Omega/(N). We show that idealized output queuing can be simulated in a shared memory architecture with (3N-2) packet memories running at the line rate, using a scheduling algorithm whose time complexity is O(log/sup 2/ N) on a parallel random access machine (PRAM). The number of processing elements and memory cells used by the PRAM are a small multiple of the size of the idealized switch.},

abstract={In this paper, we explore the issue of exploiting traffic predictability to enhance the performance of active queue management (AQM). We show that the correlation structure present in long-range dependent traffic ran be detected on-line and used to accurately predict the future traffic. We then design, with the objective of stabilising the instantaneous queue length at a desirable level, a LMMSE-based controller, and figure in the prediction results in the calculation of the packet dropping probability. The resulting scheme is termed predictive AQM (PAQM). Through analytical reasoning, we show that PAQM is a generalized version of RED with a new dimension of congestion index - the amount of traffic that will arrive in the next few measurement intervals. By stabilizing the queue at a desirable level with consideration of future traffic, PAQM enables the link capacity to be fully utilized, while not incurring excessive packet loss. Through ns-2 simulation, we compare PAQM against existing AQM schemes with respect to different performance criteria. In particular., we show that under most cases PAQM outperforms SRED in stabilizing the instantaneous queue length, and adaptive virtual queue (AVQ) in reducing packet loss ratio and better utilizing the link capacity.},

pages={1640-1649 vol.3},
abstract={Existing packet schedulers that provide fair sharing of an output link can be divided into two classes: sorted priority and frame-based. Sorted priority methods provide excellent approximation for weighted fair queueing (WFQ) while frame-based methods are more computationally efficient. We present a new packet scheduling algorithm called bin sort fair queueing (BSFQ) that combines the strengths of both type of schedulers. As a result, BSFQ is highly scalable and can provide very good approximation for WFQ. We prove that BSFQ can provide end-to-end delay and fairness guarantees to conformant flows. BSFQ also has a built-in buffer management function that can protect packets of conformant flows from nonconformant traffic. The performance of BSFQ and its ability to detect nonconformant flows are studied using simulations and compared to those of the deficit round robin method.},

pages={1650-1659 vol.3},
abstract={This paper describes and evaluates a probabilistic packet scheduling (PPS) algorithm for providing different levels of service to TCP flows. With our approach, each router defines a local currency in terms of tickets and assigns tickets to its inputs based on contractual agreements with its upstream routers. A flow is tagged with tickets to represent the relative share of bandwidth it should receive at each link. When multiple flows share the same bottleneck, the bandwidth that each flow obtains is proportional to the relative tickets assigned to that flow. Simulations show that PPS does a better job of proportionally allocating bandwidth than DiffServ and weighted CSFQ. In addition, PPS accommodates flows that cross multiple currency domains.},

abstract={Many location based routing protocols have been developed for ad hoc networks. This paper presents the results of a detailed performance evaluation on two of these protocols: location-aided routing (LAR) and distance routing effect algorithm for mobility (DREAM). We compare the performance of these two protocols with the dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol and a minimum standard (i.e., a protocol that floods all data packets). We used NS-2 to simulate 50 nodes moving according to the random waypoint model. Our main goal for the performance investigation was to stress the evaluated protocols with high data loads during both low and high speeds. Our performance investigation produced the following conclusions. First, the added protocol complexity of DREAM does not appear to provide benefits over a flooding protocol. Second, promiscuous mode operation improves the performance of DSR significantly. Third, adding location information to DSR (i.e., similar to LAR) increases both the network load and the data packet delivery ratio; our results conclude that the increase in performance is worth the increase in cost. Lastly, our implementation of DREAM provides a simple location service that could be used with other ad hoc network routing protocols.},

abstract={A novel framework is presented for the study of scalability in ad hoc networks. Using this framework, the first asymptotic analysis is provided with respect to network size, mobility, and traffic for each fundamental class of ad hoc routing algorithms. Protocols studied include the following: plain flooding (PF), standard link state (SLS), dynamic source routing (DSR), hierarchical link state (HierLS), zone routing protocol (ZRP), and hazy sighted link state (HSLS). It is shown that PF and ZRP scale better with mobility, SIJS and ZRP scale better with respect to traffic, and HSLS scales better with respect to network size. The analysis provides deeper understanding of the limits and trade-offs inherent in mobile ad hoc network routing. Our analysis is complemented with a simulation experiment comparing HSLS and HierLS. An important contribution of this paper is that HSLS is an scalable, easy-to-implement, alternative to hierarchical approaches for large ad hoc networks.},

abstract={Numerous clustering algorithms have been proposed that can support routing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). However, there is very little formal analysis that considers the communication overhead incurred by these procedures. Further, there is no published investigation of the overhead associated with the recursive application of clustering algorithms to support hierarchical routing. This paper provides a theoretical upper bound on the communication overhead incurred by a particular clustering algorithm for hierarchical routing in MANET. It is demonstrated that, given reasonable assumptions, the average clustering overhead generated per node per second is only polylogarithmic in the node count. To derive this result, novel techniques to assess cluster maintenance overhead are employed.},

volume={3},

pages={1707-1716 vol.3},
abstract={Many ad hoc routing protocols are based on some variant of flooding. Despite various optimizations, many routing messages are propagated unnecessarily. We propose a gossiping-based approach, where each node forwards a message with some probability, to reduce the overhead of the routing protocols. Gossiping exhibits bimodal behavior in sufficiently large networks: in some executions, the gossip dies out quickly and hardly any node gets the message; in the remaining executions, a substantial fraction of the nodes gets the message. The fraction of executions in which most nodes get the message depends on the gossiping probability and the topology of the network. In the networks we have considered, using gossiping probability between 0.6 and 0.8 suffices to ensure that almost every node gets the message in almost every execution. For large networks, this simple gossiping protocol uses up to 35% fewer messages than flooding, with improved performance. Gossiping can also be combined with various optimizations of flooding to yield further benefits. Simulations show that adding gossiping to AODV results in significant performance improvement, even in networks as small as 150 nodes. We expect that the improvement should be even more significant in larger networks.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently streaming a set of heterogeneous videos from a remote server through a proxy to multiple asynchronous clients so that they can experience playback with low startup delays. We develop a technique to analytically determine the optimal proxy prefix cache allocation to the videos that minimizes the aggregate network bandwidth cost. We integrate proxy caching with traditional server-based reactive transmission schemes such as batching, patching and stream merging to develop a set of proxy-assisted delivery schemes. We quantitatively explore the impact of the choice of transmission scheme, cache allocation policy, proxy cache size, and availability of unicast versus multicast capability, on the resultant transmission cost.. Our evaluations show that even a relatively small prefix cache (10%-20% of the video repository) is sufficient to realize substantial savings in transmission cost. We find that carefully designed proxy-assisted reactive transmission schemes can produce significant cost savings even in predominantly unicast environments such as the Internet.},

year={2002},

pages={1736-1745 vol.3},
abstract={We propose a system that improves the performance of streaming media CDN by exploiting the path diversity provided by existing CDN infrastructure. Path diversity is provided by the different network paths that exist between a client and its nearby edge servers; and multiple description (MD) coding is coupled with this path diversity to provide resilience to losses. In our system, MD coding is used to code a media stream into multiple complementary descriptions, which are distributed across the edge servers in the CDN. When a client requests a media stream, it is directed to multiple nearby servers which host complementary descriptions. These servers simultaneously stream these complementary descriptions to the client over different network paths. This paper provides distortion models for MDC video and conventional video. We use these models to select the optimal pair of servers with complementary descriptions for each client while accounting for path lengths and path jointness and disjointness. We also use these models to evaluate the performance of MD streaming over CDN in a number of real and generated network topologies. Our results show that distortion reduction by about 20 to 40% can be realized even when the underlying CDN is not designed with MDC streaming in mind. Also, for certain topologies, MDC requires about 50% fewer CDN servers than conventional streaming techniques to achieve the same distortion at the clients.},

abstract={This paper develops simple cost models for provisioning content distribution networks that use the simple and highly scalable bandwidth skimming protocol for streaming. New insight is obtained into: (1) how cost-effective proxy servers are in multicast streaming systems; (2) the most effective streaming protocol; and (3) the optimal proxy content, as a function of the system configuration and workload. A key result is that proxy servers are only cost effective if: (a) the origin server does not have a multicast capability; or (b) the file request rate is low, and thus multicast is not highly effective; or (c) the cost of a proxy server stream is a very small fraction (i.e., approximately 1/P) of the cost of an origin server stream, where P is the number of proxy servers and the cost of either type of stream includes both the server and network resource costs. For cases where proxy servers are cost effective, results in the paper provide the optimal proxy content and the most effective streaming protocol, as a function of a wide range of system configuration and workload parameters. In contrast to previous work, full file caching outperforms prefix caching over a significant region of this system design space, due to more efficient multicast streaming protocols as well as a more complete exploration of the practical system configuration space.},

abstract={This paper presents an optimization of the power saving mechanism in the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) in the IEEE 802.11 standard. In the IEEE 802.11 power saving mode specified for DCF, time is divided into so-called beacon intervals. At the start of each beacon interval, each node in the power saving mode periodically wakes up for a duration called the ATIM window. The nodes are required to be synchronized to ensure that all nodes wake up at the same time. During the ATIM window, the nodes exchange control packets to determine whether they need to stay awake for the rest of the beacon interval. The size of the ATIM window has a significant impact on energy saving and throughput achieved by the nodes. This paper proposes an adaptive mechanism to dynamically choose a suitable ATIM window size. We also allow the nodes to stay awake for only a fraction of the beacon interval following the ATIM window. On the other hand, IEEE 802.11 DCF mode requires the nodes to stay awake either for the entire beacon interval following the ATIM window or none at all. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the IEEE 802.11 power saving mechanism in terms of throughput and the amount of energy consumed.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of energy efficient packet scheduling in a wireless environment. We consider a wireless transmitter which is limited by its finite battery resource. Our objective is to design a transmission schedule that maximizes battery lifetime subject to some delay constraints. To achieve this, we exploit two previously unconnected ideas: (i) channel coding can be used to conserve energy by transmitting at reduced power levels over longer durations; (ii) electro-chemical mechanisms in batteries allow them to recover energy during idle periods. While the first idea favors extending transmission durations, the second idea requires the transmitter to be idle to allow for recovery. Therefore, a strategy which is based entirely on either one or the other idea is not optimal. We provide a framework to merge these two ideas. We consider two kinds of delay constraints, one a deadline constraint and the other an average delay constraint and show that energy aware scheduling strategies for both these scenarios can result in significant energy savings.},

abstract={The paper develops algorithms for minimizing the energy required to transmit packets in a wireless environment. It is motivated by the following observation: In many channel coding schemes it is possible to significantly lower the transmission energy by transmitting packets over a long period of time. Based on this observation, we show that for a variety of scenarios the offline energy-efficient transmission scheduling problem reduces to a convex optimization problem. Unlike for the special case of a single transmitter-receiver pair studied by (see Prabhakar, Uysal-Biyikoglu and El Gamal. Proc. IEEE Infocom 2001), the problem does not, in general, admit a closed-form solution when there are multiple users. By exploiting the special structure of the problem, however, we are able to devise energy-efficient transmission schedules. For the downlink channel, with a single transmitter and multiple receivers, we devise an iterative algorithm, called MoveRight, that yields the optimal offline schedule. The MoveRight algorithm also optimally solves the downlink problem with additional constraints imposed by packet deadlines and finite transmit buffers. For the uplink (or multiaccess) problem MoveRight optimally determines the offline time-sharing schedule. A very efficient online algorithm, called MoveRightExpress, that uses a surprisingly small look-ahead buffer is proposed and is shown to perform competitively with the optimal offline schedule in terms of energy efficiency and delay.},

The lifetime of a battery depends on both the manner of discharge and the transmission power requirements. We present a framework for computing the optimal discharge strategy which maximizes the lifetime of a node by exploiting the battery characteristics and adapting to the varying power requirements for wireless operations. The complexity of the optimal computation is linear in the number of system states. However, since the number of states can be large, the optimal strategy can only be computed offline and executed via a table-lookup. We also present a simple discharge strategy which can be executed online without any table lookup, and attains near maximum battery lifetime. Finally, we use state space reduction techniques to approximate the optimal computation in significantly lower complexity.},

The employment of multiple prioritized heuristic criteria and an efficient link disjoint paths search algorithm are proposed. With less computational effort, the proposed heuristic approach allows one to obtain good suboptimal results compared to the exact integer-linear-programming optimization.

With respect to the case in which any assembly mechanism is missing, the results show that an accurate dimensioning of the burstification period yields negligible penalties with regard to the low speed sources and significant benefits with regard to the high speed sources.},

abstract={Efficient planning and optimization of wavelength division multiplexing networks is an important issue today. Integer linear programming (ILP) is the most used exact method to perform this task. We propose a new ILP formulation that allows to solve optimization with less computational effort compared to other ILP approaches. This formulation applies to multifiber mesh networks with or without wavelength conversion, when either the total fiber number or the total fiber length is the cost function to be minimized. After presenting the formulation we discuss the results we obtained by exploiting it in the optimization of two case-study networks.},

abstract={Wavelength routed optical networks allow to design a logical topology, comprising lightpaths and routers, which is overlayed on the physical topology, comprising optical fibers and optical cross-connects, by solving a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem. In this paper we extend the concept of lightpath to the one of super-lightpath, which uses a simple bit level time division multiplexing that can be directly implemented in the optical domain, to split the wavelength bandwidth among more than one traffic flow. This allows to design logical topologies with an increased number of logical links, thus reducing the average distance among nodes, i.e., the number of electro-optic and opto-electronic conversions, and the traffic congestion on logical links. At the same time, this reduces the number of wavelengths required to solve the RWA problem. Being the super-lightpath RWA problem computationally intractable, we propose two heuristics which show that the number of wavelengths required to overlay the same logical topology on the same physical topology is reduced by more that 65% using super-lightpaths.},

abstract={At the access to networks, in contrast to the core, distances and feedback delays, as well as link capacities are small, which has network engineering implications that are investigated in this paper. We consider a single point in the access network which multiplexes several bursty users. The users adapt their sending rates based on feedback from the access multiplexer. Important parameters are the user's peak transmission rate p, which is the access line speed, the user's guaranteed minimum rate r, and the bound /spl epsi/ on the fraction of lost data. Two feedback schemes are proposed. In both schemes the users are allowed to send at rate p if the system is relatively lightly loaded, at rate r during periods of congestion, and at a rate between r and p, in an intermediate region. For both feedback schemes we present an exact analysis, under the assumption that the users' job sizes and think times have exponential distributions. We use our techniques to design the schemes jointly with admission control, i.e., the selection of the number of admissible users, to maximize throughput for given p, r, and /spl epsi/. Next we consider the case in which the number of users is large. Under a specific scaling, we derive explicit large deviations asymptotics for both models. We discuss the extension to general distributions of user data and think times.},

pages={13-20 vol.1},
abstract={As an effective mechanism acting on the intermediate nodes to support end-to-end congestion control, active queue management (AQM) takes a trade-off between link utilization and delay experienced by data packets. Most of the existing AQM algorithms are heuristic, and a lack systematic and theoretical design and analysis approach. From the viewpoint of control theory, it is rational to regard AQM as a typical regulating system. Although the PI controller for AQM outperforms the RED algorithm, the mismatches in the simplified TCP flow model inevitably degrade the performance of a controller designed with classical control theory. In this paper, a robust SMVS controller for AQM is put forward based on sliding mode variable structure control (SMVS), its superiority is insensitive to the noise and variance of the parameters, thus it very suitable to a time-varying network system. The principle and guidelines on design of a SMVS controller are presented in detail. The integrated performance is evaluated using ns simulations. The results show that SMVS is very responsive and robust against disturbances. At the same time, a complete comparison between the SMVS controller and PI controller is made. The conclusion is that both the transient and steady performance of the SMVS controller is superior to that of the PI controller, thus the SMVS controller is in favor of the achievement of AQM objectives.},

pages={21-30 vol.1},
abstract={Previously, a class of solutions including core-stateless fair queueing (CSFQ), rainbow fair queueing, and Diffserv have been proposed to address the scalability concerns that have plagued stateful architectures such as Intserv and fair queueing. However, despite some desirable properties, these solutions still have serious scalability, robustness, and deployment problems. Their scalability, suffers from the fact that the core cannot transcend trust boundaries (such as at ISP-ISP interconnects), and so the high-speed routers on these boundaries must maintain per flow or per aggregate state. The lack of robustness is because a single malfunctioning edge or core router could severely impact the performance of the entire network. The deployability is hampered because the set of routers must be carefully configured with a well-defined set of edge routers surrounding the core. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these limitations. The main idea is to use statistical verification to identify and contain the flows whose packets carry incorrect information. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach we develop an extension of CSFQ, called self-verifying CSFQ (SV-CSFQ). With SV-CSFQ, rate estimation is performed by sending hosts, and all routers statistically verify these rate estimates. Statistical verification allows routers to identify misbehaving flows and routers, and thereby protect other flows. This makes our approach robust and highly scalable as it eliminates the need for stateful routers at trust boundaries, and for the core-edge distinction. We present simulations and analysis of the performance of this approach, and discuss its general applicability to provide other scalable and robust network services.},

pages={31-40 vol.1},
abstract={Interactive TCP applications, such as Telnet and the Web, are particularly sensitive to network congestion. Indeed, congestion-induced queuing and packet loss can be a significant cause of large delays and variability, thereby decreasing user-perceived quality. We consider addressing these effects using service differentiation, by giving priority to interactive applications' traffic in the network. We study different packet marking schemes and handling mechanisms (packet dropping and scheduling) in the network. For marking packets, two approaches are considered. First, we look into application-based marking, and show how the protection of Telnet traffic against loss can eliminate large echo delays caused by retransmit timeouts, and how, by limiting packet loss for Web page downloads, their delays can be significantly reduced, resulting in enhanced interactivity. Second, we consider differentiation based on TCP state, where we present a marking algorithm that prioritizes packets at the source, based on each connection's window size. In addition, we describe the shaping mechanisms required for conformance to agreements with the network. We show how this marking results in good response times for short transfers, which are characteristic of interactive applications, without significantly affecting longer ones.},

pages={41-47 vol.1},
abstract={A number of bandwidth reservation schemes have been proposed for multi-channel rings, generally classified as centralized and distributed. Besides simulation results, the existing analytical models address only the blocking probability and achievable throughput of such schemes. However, in determining the properties and advantages of each reservation scheme (especially the LightRing, a scheme previously proposed by the authors) the above performance figures are not sufficient, as network latency plays a determinant role when fast bandwidth provisioning is of the essence. This paper presents an analytical framework that allows one to derive the response time and throughput of such schemes under the assumption that a single request for bandwidth can be stored and processed by the source at a time. Numerical results obtained using the proposed model reveal a number of interesting properties of the existing bandwidth reservation schemes.},

abstract={We present a new approach to the virtual-topology reconfiguration problem for wavelength-routed, optical wide-area networks under dynamic traffic demand. By utilizing the measured Internet backbone traffic characteristics, an adaptation mechanism is proposed to follow the changes in traffic without assuming that the future traffic pattern is known. In that sense, our work differs from previous studies which redesign the virtual-topology according to an expected (or known) traffic pattern, and then modify the connectivity to reach the target topology. The key idea of our approach is to adapt the underlying optical connectivity by measuring the actual traffic load on lightpaths continuously (periodically based on a measurement period) and reacting promptly to the imbalances caused by fluctuations in the traffic by adding or deleting one lightpath at a time. We aim to correct the encountered load imbalance directly, either by tearing down a lightpath that is lightly loaded or by setting up a new lightpath when congestion occurs. We introduce high and low watermark parameters on lightpath loads to detect any over/underutilized lightpath, and to trigger an adaptation step. The adaptation method is evaluated through simulations and the effect of system parameters (high and low watermarks, length of the measurement period) are investigated.},

abstract={Coupling MPLS traffic engineering on top of a wavelength-routed WDM layer offers great flexibility to operators to allocate traffic demands in their networks. We consider the problem of off-line joint configuration at both packet and optical layers. We consider time-variant offered traffic, and assume that the operator has knowledge of the traffic dynamics as a set of traffic matrices at different instants. A novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is proposed, which takes as input this set of traffic matrices, and provides an optimal static configuration capable of accommodating the time-varying traffic. We provide a resolution strategy based on heuristics, and give numerical results for some sample cases. The proposed method is compared with a simple alternative approach for obtaining a single static solution, to show that our method utilizes much fewer resources. The solution under the proposed formulation is also compared with the set of solutions obtained by running distinct optimization problems at different instants, showing that the increase of resource is minimal. Hence our approach can provide a static configuration with about the same resources as a fully adaptable dynamical configuration.},

abstract={This paper concerns itself with the performance of deflection routing in optical burst-switched networks based on just-enough-time (JET) signaling. Generally speaking, buffer requirement is not vital for JET-based optical burst switching (OBS). However, if deflection routing is enabled, optical buffers are necessary to solve the insufficient offset time problem. A variant of priority queuing model is proposed to approximate burst loss probability and the results show that the model provides an accurate estimation. We also evaluate the performance of deflection routing in Arpanet-2 topology. Simulation results indicate that deflection routing evidently brings significant blocking performance gain, especially with fewer wavelengths and under lighter load. In addition, we notice that excessive deflection will cause longer end-to-end delay and reduce the blocking performance. Therefore, it is necessary to control the maximum allowed deflection occurrences of a burst.},

abstract={We consider a queue fed by a mixture of light-tailed and heavy-tailed traffic. The two traffic classes are served in accordance with the generalized processor sharing (GPS) discipline. GPS-based scheduling algorithms, such as weighted fair queueing (WFQ), have emerged as an important mechanism for achieving service differentiation in integrated networks. We derive the asymptotic workload behavior of the light-tailed class for the situation where its GPS weight is larger than its traffic intensity. The GPS mechanism ensures that the workload is bounded above by that in an isolated system with the light-tailed class served in isolation at a constant rate equal to its GPS weight. We show that the workload distribution is in fact asymptotically equivalent to that in the isolated system, multiplied with a certain pre-factor, which accounts for the interaction with the heavy-tailed class. Specifically, the pre-factor represents the probability that the heavy-tailed class is backlogged long enough for the light-tailed class to reach overflow. The results provide crucial qualitative insight in the typical overflow scenario.},

pages={84-93 vol.1},
abstract={Packet scale rate guarantee (PSRG) is a generic node model which underlies the definition of expedited forwarding (EF) proposed in the context of Internet differentiated services (DiffServ). For the case of FIFO nodes, PSRG is equivalent to the well-understood concept of adaptive service curve. However, in practice, many devices do not necessarily preserve the FIFO property, and therefore known FIFO results do not hold. This paper analyzes the properties of PSRG in the absence of FIFO assumptions. Our analysis is based on a novel characterization of PSRG which avoids the use of virtual finish times; it is obtained by min-max algebra. We use it to show that delay bounds previously obtained for the FIFO case are still valid; in contrast, we find that this is not true for the characterization of the concatenation of two nodes.},

The problem is to decide which requests to serve so as to maximize the server's utilization. This simple model captures many situations, both at the application (e.g., delivery of video) as well as at the network/transmission levels (e.g., scheduling of packets from input to output interface of a switch). The problem is on-line in nature, and thus we use competitive analysis for measuring the performance of our scheduling algorithms. We consider two modes of operation - with and without commitment - and derive upper and lower bounds for each case. Since competitive analysis is based on the worst-case scenario, the average-case performance of the algorithms is also examined by a simulation study.},

abstract={To provide flexibility in deploying new protocols and services, general-purpose processing engines are being placed in the datapath of routers. Such network processors are typically simple RISC multiprocessors that perform forwarding and custom application processing of packets. The inherent unpredictability of execution time of an arbitrary instruction code poses a significant challenge in providing QoS guarantees for data flows that compete for such processing resources in the network. However, we show that network processing workloads are highly regular and predictable. Using estimates of execution times of various applications on packets of given lengths, we provide a method for admission control and QoS scheduling of processing resources. We present a processor scheduling algorithm called estimation-based fair queuing (EFQ) which uses these estimates, and provides significantly better delay guarantees than processor scheduling algorithms which do not take packet execution times into consideration.},

year={2002},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={113-121 vol.1},
abstract={Routing with service restorability is very important in multiprotocol label switched (MPLS) networks, and is a necessity in optical networks. For restoration, each connection has an active path and a disjoint backup path. The backup path enables service restoration upon active path failure. For bandwidth efficiency, backups may be shared. This requires that at least the aggregate backup bandwidth used on each link be distributed to nodes performing route computations. If this information is not available, sharing is not possible. Also, one scheme in use for restorability in optical networks is for the sender to transmit simultaneously on the two disjoint paths and for the receiver to choose data from the path with stronger signal. This has the advantage of fast receiver-initiated recovery upon failure but it does not allow backup sharing. We consider the problem of efficient dynamic routing of restorable connections when backup sharing is not allowed. Our objective is to be able to route as many connections as possible for one-at-a-time arrivals and no knowledge of future arrivals. Since sharing cannot be used for achieving efficiency, the goal is to achieve efficiency by improved path selection. We show that by using the minimum-interference ideas used for non-restorable routing, we can develop efficient algorithms that outperform previously proposed algorithms for restorable routing such as routing with the min-hop like objective of finding two disjoint paths with minimum total hop-count. We present two new and efficient algorithms for restorable routing without sharing, and one of them requires only shortest path computations. We demonstrate that both algorithms perform very well in comparison to previously proposed algorithms.},

abstract={We consider the issue of network capacity. Recent work by Li and Yeung examined the network capacity of multicast networks and related capacity to cutsets. Capacity is achieved by coding over a network. We present a new framework for studying networks and their capacity. Our framework, based on algebraic methods, is surprisingly simple and effective. For networks which are restricted to using linear codes (we make the meaning of linear codes precise, since the codes are not bit-wise linear), we find necessary and sufficient conditions for any given set of connections to be achievable over a given network. For multicast connections, linear codes are not a restrictive assumption, since all achievable connections can be achieved using linear codes. Moreover, coding can be used to maintain connections after permanent failures, such as the removal of an edge from the network. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of connections to be robust to a set of permanent failures. For multicast connections, we show the rather surprising result that, if a multicast connection is achievable under different failure scenarios, a single static code can ensure robustness of the connection under all of those failure scenarios.},

title={Restoration algorithms for virtual private networks in the hose model},
year={2002},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={131-139 vol.1},
abstract={A virtual private network (VPN) aims to emulate the services provided by a private network over the shared Internet. The endpoints of a VPN are connected using abstractions such as virtual channels (VCs) of ATM or label switched paths (LSPs) of MPLS technologies. Reliability of an end-to-end VPN connection depends on the reliability of the links and nodes in the fixed path that it traverses in the network. In order to ensure service quality and availability in a VPN, seamless recovery from failures is essential. This work considers the problem of fast recovery in the recently proposed VPN hose model. In the hose model, bandwidth is reserved for traffic aggregates instead of pairwise specifications to allow any traffic pattern among the VPN endpoints. This work assumes that the VPN endpoints are connected using a tree structure and, at any time, at most one tree link can fail (i.e., single link failure model). A restoration algorithm must select a set of backup edges and allocate necessary bandwidth on them in advance, so that the traffic disrupted by failure of a primary edge can be re-routed via backup paths. We aim at designing an optimal restoration algorithm to minimize the total bandwidth reserved on the backup edges. This problem is a variant of optimal graph augmentation problem which is NP-complete. Thus, we present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution which is at most 16 times of the optimum. The algorithm is based on designing two reductions to convert the original problem to one of adding minimum cost edges to the VPN tree so that the resulting graph is 2-connected, which can be solved in polynomial time using known algorithms. The two reductions introduce approximation factors of 8 and 2, respectively, thus resulting in a 16-approximation algorithm with polynomial time complexity.},

abstract={In MPLS/GMPLS networks, a range of restoration schemes are required to support different tradeoffs between service interruption time and network resource utilization. In light of these tradeoffs, path-based, end-to-end shared restoration provides a very attractive solution. However, efficient use of capacity for shared restoration strongly relies on the selection procedure of restoration paths. We propose an efficient path-selection algorithm for restoration of connections over shared bandwidth in a fully distributed GMPLS architecture. We also describe how to extend GMPLS signaling protocols to collect the necessary information efficiently. To evaluate the algorithm's performance, we compare it via simulation with two other well-known algorithm on a typical intercity backbone network. The key figure-of-merit for restoration capacity efficiency is restoration overbuild, i.e., the extra capacity required to meet the network restoration objective as a percentage of the capacity of the network with no restoration. Our simulation results show that our algorithm uses significantly less restoration overbuild (63-68%) compared to the other two algorithms (83-90%).},

abstract={As the Internet evolves into a ubiquitous communication infrastructure and provides various services including telephony, it has to stand up to the toll quality standards set by traditional telephone companies. Our objective is to assess to what extent today's Internet meets this expectation. Our assessment is based on delay and loss measurements taken over wide-area backbone networks, considers realistic VoIP scenarios and uses quality measures appropriate for voice. Our findings indicate that although voice services can be adequately provided by some ISPs, a significant number of paths lead to poor performance even for excellent VoIP end-systems. This makes a strong case for special handling of voice traffic on those paths. Even on the good paths, rare loss events can occasionally cause perceptible degradation of voice quality. Finally, the appropriate choice of the playout buffer scheme for each path was found to be of critical importance for the perceived quality.},

abstract={Packet delay traces are important measurements for analyzing end-to-end performance and for designing traffic control algorithms in computer networks. Due to the fact that the clocks at the end systems are usually not synchronized and running at different speeds, these measurements can be quite inaccurate. We propose several algorithms to estimate and remove the relative clock skews from delay measurements based on the computation of convex hulls. Compared with existing techniques, such as linear regression and linear programming, the convex-hull approach provides better insight and allows us to handle more error metrics. We obtain algorithms which are linear in the number of measurement points for the case with no clock resets. For the more challenging case with clock resets, i.e., the clocks are reset to some reference times during the measurement period, we develop linear algorithms to identity the clock resets, and derive the best clock skew lines. We extend this analysis to environments in which at least one of the clocks is controlled by NTP (network time protocol). These algorithms can greatly improve the accuracy of the measurements, and can be used both online and offline. They can also be extended for active clock synchronization, to replace or further improve NTP. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithms.},

abstract={We propose using coordinates-based mechanisms in a peer-to-peer architecture to predict Internet network distance (i.e. round-trip propagation and transmission delay). We study two mechanisms. The first is a previously proposed scheme, called the triangulated heuristic, which is based on relative coordinates that are simply the distances from a host to some special network nodes. We propose the second mechanism, called global network positioning (GNP), which is based on absolute coordinates computed from modeling the Internet as a geometric space. Since end hosts maintain their own coordinates, these approaches allow end hosts to compute their inter-host distances as soon as they discover each other. Moreover, coordinates are very efficient in summarizing inter-host distances, making these approaches very scalable. By performing experiments using measured Internet distance data, we show that both coordinates-based schemes are more accurate than the existing state of the art system IDMaps, and the GNP approach achieves the highest accuracy and robustness among them.},

abstract={We consider ad hoc wireless networks that use directional antennas and have limited energy resources. The performance objectives of such networks depend largely on the application. However, a robust performance measure is the total traffic volume that the network can deliver when all nodes are equipped with a finite and non-renewable amount of energy. We show that the network's lifetime can be extended significantly by incorporating a simple measure of a node's residual energy into the node's cost function. To explore quantitatively the advantage offered by the use of directional antennas over the case of omnidirectional antennas, we consider the case of connection-oriented multicast traffic. Building upon our prior work on multicasting algorithms, we introduce two protocols that exploit the use of directional antennas and evaluate their performance. We observe significant improvement with respect to the omnidirectional case.},

abstract={Power-saving is a critical issue for almost all kinds of portable devices. In this paper, we consider the design of power-saving protocols for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) that allow mobile hosts to switch to a low-power sleep mode. The MANETs being considered in this paper are characterized by unpredictable mobility, multi-hop communication, and no clock synchronization mechanism. In particular, the last characteristic would complicate the problem since a host has to predict when another host will wake up to receive packets. We propose three power management protocols, namely dominating-awake-interval, periodically-fully-awake-interval, and quorum-based protocols, which are directly applicable to IEEE 802.11-based MANETs. As far as we know, the power management problem for multi-hop MANETs has not been seriously addressed in the literature. Existing standards, such as IEEE 802.11, HIPERLAN, and Bluetooth, all assume that the network is fully connected or there is a clock synchronization mechanism. Extensive simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.},

abstract={We study the performance metrics associated with TCP-regulated traffic in multi-hop wireless networks that use a common physical channel (e.g., IEEE 802.11). In contrast to earlier analyses, we focus simultaneously on two key operating metrics - the energy efficiency and the session throughput. Using analysis and simulations, we show how these metrics are strongly influenced by the radio transmission range of individual nodes. Due to tradeoffs between the individual packet transmission energy and the likelihood of retransmissions, the total energy consumption is a convex function of the number of hops (and hence, of the transmission range). On the other hand, the TCP session throughput decreases supra-linearly with a decrease in the transmission range. In certain scenarios, the overall network capacity can then be a concave function of the transmission range. Based on our analysis of the performance of an individual TCP session, we finally study how parameters such as the node density and the radio transmission range affect the overall network capacity under different operating conditions. Our analysis shows that capacity metrics at the TCP layer behave quite differently than corresponding idealized link-layer metrics.},

abstract={Directional antennas can be useful in significantly increasing node and network lifetime in wireless ad hoc networks. In order to utilize directional antennas, an algorithm is needed that will enable nodes to point their antennas to the right place at the right time. In this paper we present an energy-efficient routing and scheduling algorithm that coordinates transmissions in ad hoc networks where each node has a single directional antenna. Using the topology consisting of all the possible links in the network, we first find shortest cost paths to be energy efficient. Then, we calculate the amount of traffic that has to go over each link and find the maximum amount of time each link can be up, using end-to-end traffic information to achieve that routing. Finally, we schedule nodes' transmissions, trying to minimize the total time it takes for all possible transmitter-receiver pairs to communicate with each other. We formulate this link problem as solving a series of maximal-weight matching in a graph. Furthermore, we propose a method that can enable our scheduling algorithm to work in a distributed and adaptive fashion. We demonstrate that our algorithm achieves all the possible transmitter/receiver gains possible from using directional antennas. In addition, we illustrate through simulation that our routing scheme achieves up to another 45% improvement in energy cost for routing.},

We validate our model with simulations and illustrate the stability region of TCP/RED. These results suggest that TCP/RED becomes unstable when delay increases, or more strikingly, when link capacity increases. The analysis illustrates the difficulty of setting RED parameters to stabilize TCP: they can be tuned to improve stability, but only at the cost of large queues even when they are dynamically adjusted. Finally, we present a simple distributed congestion control algorithm that maintains stability for arbitrary network delay, capacity, load and topology.},

The dynamical model is used to analyze the TCP-RED operating point and its stability with respect to various RED controller and system parameters. Bifurcations are shown to occur as various system parameters are varied. These bifurcations, which involve the emergence of oscillatory and/or chaotic behavior, may provide an explanation for the parameter sensitivity observed in practice. The bifurcations arise due to the presence of a nonlinearity in the characteristics of TCP throughput as a function of drop probability at the gateway. Among the bifurcations observed in the system are the period-doubling bifurcation and border collision bifurcations. The bifurcations are studied analytically, numerically, and experimentally.},

This approach provides a new, statistically sound paradigm for network simulations: instead of simulating a protocol over long times, or explicitly finding the stationary distribution of a Markov chain, use Coupling from the Past to quickly obtain samples from the stationary distribution. Coupling from the Past is most efficient when the underlying state space satisfies a partial order and certain monotonicity conditions. To efficiently apply this general paradigm to TCP, we demonstrate that the states of a simple TCP model possess a monotonic partial order; this order appears interesting in its own right. Preliminary simulation results indicate that this approach is quite efficient, and produces results which am similar to those obtained by simulating a TCP-Tahoe connection.},

abstract={This paper describes a control mechanism for a future Internet. It is an economic mechanism that enables users to choose different pairs of price/QoS priority levels for network services at the user time scale. The user time scale means that prices vary at a rate suitable for human beings to respond to those price changes. The changes might happen on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. We believe that such an economic control mechanism at a medium time scale, which is coupled with a technical rate control mechanism at a short time scale, is a simple and cost-reducing system that can provide quality of service to end-users. We show that the approach proposed enables network service providers to react to network congestion appropriately and provide end-users with high flexibility in service selection. After discussing different Internet pricing principles, we describe the market-managed test network, the QoS pricing and charging software for network services, and the experiments run on a DiffServ network. We present a theoretical model based on Markov chains that can represent the proposed market-managed network.

abstract={We consider a network where each user is charged a fixed price per unit of bandwidth used, but where there is no congestion-dependent pricing. However, the transmission rate of each user is assumed to be a function of network congestion (like TCP), and the price per unit bandwidth. We are interested in answering the following question: how should the network choose the price to maximize its overall revenue? To obtain a tractable solution, we consider a single link accessed by many users where the capacity is increased in proportion to the number of users. We show the following result: as the number of users increases, the optimal price per unit bandwidth charged by the service provider may increase or decrease depending upon the bandwidth of the link. However, for all values of the link capacity, the service provider's revenue per unit bandwidth increases and the overall performance of each user (measured in terms of a function of its throughput, the network congestion and the cost incurred by the user for bandwidth usage) improves. Since the revenue per unit bandwidth increases, it provides an incentive for the service provider to increase the available bandwidth in proportion to the number of users.},

pages={302-311 vol.1},
abstract={This paper describes a novel framework, called distributed partial information management (or DPIM). It addresses several major challenges in achieving efficient shared path protection under distributed control with only partial information, including (1) how much partial information about existing active and backup paths (or APs and BPs respectively) is maintained and exchanged; (2) how to obtain a good estimate of the bandwidth needed by a candidate BP, called BBW, and subsequently select a pair of AP and BP for a connection establishment request so as to minimize total bandwidth consumption and/or maximize revenues; (3) how to distributively allocate minimal BBW (and deallocate maximal BBW) via distributed signaling; and (4) how to update and subsequently exchange the partial information. A DPIM-based scheme using integer linear programming is described to illustrate our approach. In addition, an ultrafast and efficient heuristic scheme is described. With about the same amount of partial information, such a heuristic-based DPIM scheme can achieve almost as a good performance as the ILP-based DPIM scheme, and a much better performance than another ILP-based scheme described by Kodialam and Lakshman (see INFOCOM'00, p.902-911, 2000). The paper also presents an elegant method to support dynamic requests for protected, unprotected, and pre-emptable connections in the unified DPIM framework.},

pages={312-321 vol.1},
abstract={Various monitoring and performance evaluation tools generate considerable amount of low priority traffic. This information is not always needed in real time, and thus could often be delayed by the network without hurting functionality. This paper proposes a new framework to handle this low priority, but resource consuming traffic in such a way that it will incur a minimal interference with the higher priority traffic, and thus improve the network goodput. The key idea is to allow the network nodes to delay data by locally storing it. This can be done, for example, in the active network paradigm. We show that the active network paradigm can improve the network's goodput dramatically even if a very simple scheduling algorithm is used. To obtain minimal cost schedules we define an optimization problem that we call the travelling miser problem. We study primarily the on-line variant of this problem, which is of greater practical interest. For this problem we develop an enhanced scheduling strategy, study its characteristics in a restricted case, and evaluate its performance through a rigorous simulation study.},

abstract={This paper utilizes belief networks to implement fault localization in communication systems taking into account comprehensive information about the system behavior. Most previous work on this subject performs fault localization based solely on the information about malfunctioning system components (i.e., negative symptoms). We show that positive information, i.e., the lack of any disorder in some system components, may be used to improve the accuracy of this process. The technique presented allows lost and spurious symptoms to be incorporated in the analysis. We show through simulation that in a noisy network environment the analysis of lost and spurious symptoms increases the robustness of fault localization with belief networks. We also demonstrate that belief networks yield high accuracy even for approximate probability input data and therefore are a promising model for non-deterministic fault localization.},

pages={332-341 vol.1},
abstract={This paper describes a mechanism allowing nodes to hand-off active connections by utilizing connection splicing at an edge-switch serving as a gateway to a server cluster. The mechanism is primarily intended to be used as part of a content aware request distribution strategy. Our approach uses an extended form of network address translation which maps inbound connection information (ie., address, port, and sequence number) to a separate outbound connection. A key difference in our approach is that while the switch performs network address translation and TCP splicing, the actual hand-off is triggered by the back-end nodes. This relieves the switch of performing any application layer responsibilities. Nodes may hand-off connections by first initiating a new connection to the destination and then sending a message to the gateway which splices the two connections together. The gateway modifies subsequent packet headers in order to create a transparent hand-off. This mechanism requires no modification to the operating system on the servers or the clients and supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections and pipelined requests. To test our design, we implemented a soft-switch using Linux Netfilter which includes the extended network address translation. We provide some preliminary performance analysis and make recommendations for future work.},

number={},
pages={342-351 vol.1},
abstract={We present three algorithms that provide- performance guarantees for scheduling switches, such as optical switches, with configuration overhead. Each algorithm emulates an unconstrained (zero overhead) switch by accumulating a batch of configuration requests and generating a corresponding schedule for a constrained switch. Speedup is required both to cover the configuration overhead of the switch and to compensate for empty slots left by the scheduling algorithm. Scheduling algorithms are characterized by the number of configurations, N/sub s/, they require to cover a batch of requests, and the speedup required to compensate for empty slots, S/sub min/. We show that a well known exact matching algorithm, EXACT, leaves no empty slots (i.e. S/sub min/=1), but requires N/sub s//spl ap/N/sup 2/ configurations for an N-port switch leading to high overhead or large batches and hence high delay. We present two new algorithms that reduce the number of configurations required substantially. MIN covers a batch of requests in the minimum possible number of configurations, N/sub s/=N, but at the expense of many empty slots, S/sub min//spl ap/4log/sub 2/ N. DOUBLE strikes a balance, requiring twice as many configurations, N/sub s/=2N, while reducing the number of empty slots so that S/sub min/=2. We show that DOUBLE offers the lowest required speedup to emulate an unconstrained switch across a wide range of port count and delay.},

year={2002},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={352-361 vol.1},
abstract={Distributed switch architectures allow the partition of a switch fabric into smaller independent switches, which is a key advantage for building high capacity switching systems, such as terabit switches. The performance and the feasibility of a distributed switch architecture depend on two critical components: the design of the queueing structure and the load balancing algorithm. In this paper, we present a distributed switch architecture with a simple yet efficient queueing structure and load-balancing algorithm that can be easily implemented in a terabit switch fabric with OC-768 line rate. The queueing structure is based on distributed non-buffered input-queued crossbar switch elements with request-only virtual output queues. The distributed load-balancing algorithm dynamically balances workloads among the parallel switch elements by trying to equalize the length of request-only virtual output queues in each of the switch elements. We refer to our architecture as a distributed switch architecture (ADSA), which introduces little communication overhead and no throughput degradation. As a result, it enables non-blocking switching without the need for internal speed-up. The load-balancing algorithm can perform one load-balancing action in less than 10 ns, which is suitable for OC-768 line rates of 40 Gbps. We study the performance of the ADSA architecture by modeling it as discrete-time queues with uniform i.i.d. Bernoulli traffic. We use a combination of analytical and simulation approaches to show that the ADSA can be approximated as discrete-time Geom/G/P queues under both light and heavy loads. Then the Allen-Cunneen approximation formula is applied to derive the mean cell delay of the ADSA architecture as a function of the underlying crossbar scheduling algorithm, the number of parallel switch elements and the number of ports in the system.},

abstract={Optical burst switching (OBS) is an experimental network technology that enables the construction of very high capacity routers, using optical data paths and electronic control. In this paper, we study two designs for wavelength converting switches that are suitable for use in optical burst switching systems and evaluate their performance. Both designs use tunable lasers to implement wavelength conversion. One is a strictly nonblocking design, that also requires optical crossbars. The second substitutes wavelength grating routers (WGR) for the optical crossbars, reducing cost, but introducing some potential for blocking. We show how the routing problem for the WGR-based switches can be formulated as a combinatorial puzzle or game, in which the design of the game board corresponds to the pattern of interconnections used to join the input sections of the switch to the output sections. We use this to show how the interconnection pattern affects the performance of the switch, and to facilitate the design of interconnection patterns that yield the best performance. Our results show that for a typical switch configuration, the WGR-based design can deliver more than 87% of the throughput of a fully nonblocking switch.},

abstract={This paper describes new optical switching architectures supporting asynchronous variable-length packets. Output line contention is resolved by optical delay line buffers. By introducing a WDM technology, a parallel buffer can be equipped with multiple wavelengths on the optical delay line buffer. Using an ultrafast photonic label processing technique, an implementation of our architecture would be fast enough for packet scheduling that selects the appropriate output port, wavelength, and delay line buffer. To evaluate the switch performance, we model an output port of our switch as a multi-server and multi-queue system where each server corresponds to a wavelength and where each arriving packet joins the shortest queue. We use an approximate analytic approach to evaluate the switch performance. The results of the analysis and of simulation experiments show that the use of the WDM technique can greatly improve the switch performance in terms of packet loss probabilities.},

This approach leads to new formulas and simulation schemes allowing one to compute/estimate the spatial averages of these local characteristics in function of the model parameters (density of antennas or mobiles, law of emission power, fading law etc.) and to perform various parametric optimizations.},

abstract={We study bursty data communications in the downlink in code division multiple access (CDMA) systems. We first present a new model that simultaneously takes into account the traffic burstiness and time-varying fading for studying the multi-access interference (MAI), and characterize the MAI from a stochastic process perspective. This new approach enables us to understand the temporal correlation structure. Our finding reveals that the MAI exhibits scale-invariant burstiness and is "self similar" across multiple time scales. The MAI self similarity indicates the existence of a nontrivial predictive MAI structure, which we exploit to conduct resource allocation for interference management. In particular, we utilize the MAI temporal structure to construct a multiple time-scale interference predictor, which is used to predict the MAI level. Rate adaptation is then carried out based on the predicted MAI. Our results show that this rate control scheme achieves better performance than that of the packet-level predictor, and can yield significant performance gain. We also devise a joint rate control and admission control scheme. Specifically, observation time windows are divided into slots, and rate control based on interference prediction is conducted in each slot. Then, the corresponding throughput in each observation window is used for admission control. We also investigate the impact of feedback delay and data burstiness on the system performance.},

Our method uses a composite performance metric which has the capability of proportionally combining three basic parameters: channel utilization, waiting time and the saving in the signalling overhead. The scheduler at the base station is not only responsible for admitting new services into the system but also for switching the MAC states of a service depending on its activity. Since the true nature of the wireless data traffic is yet unknown, we use a mix of Poisson-distributed voice packets and Pareto-distributed data packets. We derive analytical expressions and also conduct simulation experiments to study the nature of the performance curve and thus compute the optimal values of expiration timers at which the MAC states should be switched such that the system performance is maximized. We show how our model can be made suitable for different systems by tuning the scaling functions (or weights) for each of the three performance parameters considered.},

abstract={Initiatives to add mobility to the Internet and packet data services in third-generation (3G) cellular systems are being considered as candidate solutions for the delivery or IP data to mobile users. The Transport Control Protocol (TCP) will continue to be the most widely used transport protocol for a certain duration in 3G cellular Internet networks. Initially designed for high-speed wireline networks where random packet loss can be negligible, TCP can yield a significant throughput deterioration when applied to lossy links without modification since the primary cause of packet loss may not be network congestion. Two new types of loss can dominate TCP's performance: one is dropped packets because of route disconnection from frequent handoffs; the other is relatively high bit error rate (BER) of radio propagation channels due to multipath fading. Unlike much or the early TCP studies that largely relied on simulations, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis by modeling typical TCP congestion control algorithms. We adopt finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model as the basis of link error definition since in typical cases it is not adequate to model a radio communication channel as a two-state Gilbert-Elliott channel when the channel quality varies dramatically. To enhance TCP performance in cellular networks, we adopt the idea of active-mobile-host to constrain the negative effect of handoff on TCP throughput in a minimized range. The accuracy of our analytical model is verified through the comparison with measurements using UCB/LBNL Network Simulator (ns-2).},

First we formulate our model as a nonlinear complementarity problem. Then we transform the model into two equivalent formulations: fixed point formulation and nonlinear programming formulation. These equivalent formulations provide efficient computational procedures for the solution of our model. Furthermore, with the help of the fixed point formulation we are able to prove the existence of a solution. Our model has the main advantage of not requiring the pre-definition of bottleneck links. The model also takes into account the receiver congestion window limitation. Our approach can be used for TCP/IP networks with drop tail buggers as well as for TCP/IP networks with active queue management buggers. We solve the problem for some network examples and we show how the distribution of load varies with network parameters. The distribution of load is sometimes counter-intuitive which cannot be detected by other models making prior assumptions on the locations of bottlenecks.},

title={Packet scheduling with fragmentation},
year={2002},
volume={1},

pages={427-436 vol.1},
abstract={We investigate a scheduling problem in a TDMA environment where packets may be fragmented. Our model of the problem is derived from a scheduling problem present in data over CATV networks, where a slotted TDMA channel is used to carry both real-time and best-effort traffic. Packets of real-time flows have high priority and are allocated in fixed, periodically located slots. Best-effort packets have lower priority and must therefore use the remaining slots. The scheduling problem tackles the assignment of variable size best-effort packets into the free slots which are left between successive allocation of real-time packets. One of the capabilities of the system is the ability to break a packet into several fragments. But, when a packet is fragmented, extra bits are added to the original packet to enable the reassembly of all the fragments. We transform the scheduling problem into a variant of bin packing where items may be fragmented. When an item is fragmented overhead units are added to the size of every fragment. The overhead associated with fragmentation renders the optimization problem NP-hard; therefore, an approximation algorithm is needed. We define a version of the well-known Next-Fit algorithm, capable of fragmenting items, and investigate its performance. We present both worst case and average case results and compare them to the case where fragmentation is not allowed.},

abstract={Consider networks in Wardrop equilibria, i.e., situations where each user in a network strives to optimize its own cost noncooperatively but has only an infinitesimal impact on other users. In computer networking, some shortest-path routing protocols that reflect link queueing delays may bring about situations close to Wardrop equilibria. The Braess (1968) paradox is a famous example of paradoxical cases where adding capacity to a network degrades the costs for all users. This paper investigates, in particular, networks generalized from what were studied by Cohen (1990, 1997), Kelly (1990), and Jeffries (1997) in comparison with the networks of the same topology as the original Braess network. The measure of cost degradation considered is the ratio of the cost for each user of a network after adding capacity (a link) to that before adding capacity. It has been shown that a value of the measure is less than 2 for every general Braess network. The results of this paper show that the measure of paradoxical cost degradation is also less than 2 for all of the networks considered in this paper.},

abstract={Properties of heterogeneous network traffic have been investigated from different aspects, resulting in different understanding. Specifically, one previous work discovers that the variance of network traffic exhibits a linear relationship with respect to the mean. Such a linear relation suggests that the traffic is "Poisson-like", and thus "smooth". On the other hand, prior work has shown that the heterogeneous traffic can be long-range dependent, and is thus bursty. The focus of this work is to investigate these seemingly contradictory issues, and to provide a unified understanding on the burstiness of heterogeneous traffic. In particular, we use a simple statistic, the variance of the traffic, for our investigation. We first study variance-mean relations at a single time scale. We then investigate the behavior of variances at multiple time scales, which determines the temporal correlation structure. Finally, we provide a unified view to include most important understanding of the network traffic.},

pages={457-466 vol.2},
abstract={We propose SWAN, a stateless network model which uses distributed control algorithms to deliver service differentiation in mobile wireless ad hoc networks in a simple, scalable and robust manner. We use rate control for UDP and TCP best-effort traffic, and sender-based admission control for UDP real-time traffic. SWAN uses explicit congestion notification (ECN) to dynamically regulate admitted real-time traffic in the face of network dynamics brought on by mobility or traffic overload conditions. We use the term "soft" real-time services to indicate that real-time sessions could be regulated or dropped due to mobility or excessive traffic overloading at mobile wireless routers. SWAN is designed to limit such conditions, however. A novel aspect of SWAN is that it does not require the support of a QOS-capable MAC. Rather, soft real-time services are built using existing best effort wireless MAC technology. Simulation, analysis, and results from an experimental wireless testbed show that real-time applications experience low and stable delays under various multi-hop, traffic and mobility conditions. The wireless testbed and ns-2 simulator source code are available from the Web (comet.columbia.edu/swan).},

abstract={In this paper, we are interested in developing a control algorithm or transmission scheme for wireless data communication over time-varying channels with memory that determines when to attempt a transmission and at what power level, so as to achieve a suitable balance between throughput and energy consumption; and studying the effect of channel memory on the performance, design, and structure of this scheme. The channel state is not directly observable, and thus the transmission decisions must be based on partial or incomplete channel state information, provided to the user by the base station over a feedback channel. More specifically, we assume that the delayed channel state information is provided to the sender at the end of those time slots during which packet transmissions are made. We cast the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process. Despite the difficulty associated with the incomplete channel information, we obtain the optimal transmission scheme, which can be interpreted as a back-off rule: at the end of the transmission, depending on the channel quality during the past time slot, the transmission may be suspended for some time slots, which can be computed in advance. Numerical results are also provided.},

pages={477-486},
abstract={For wireless cellular and ad hoc networks with QoS constraints, we propose a suite of problem formulations that allocate network resources to optimize SIR, maximize throughput and minimize delay. The distinguishing characteristics of these resource allocation formulations is that, by using convex optimization, they accommodate a variety of realistic QoS and fairness constraints. Their globally optimal solutions can be computed efficiently through polynomial time interior point methods, even though they use nonlinear objectives and constraints. Through power control in wireless cellular networks, we optimize SIR and delay for a particular QoS class, subject to QoS constraints for all other QoS classes. For wireless ad hoc networks with multihop transmissions and Rayleigh fading, we optimize various objectives, such as the overall system throughput, subject to constraints on power, probability of outage, and data rates. These formulations can also be used for admission control and relative pricing. Both proportional and minmax fairness can be implemented under the convex optimization framework, where fairness parameters can be jointly optimized with QoS criteria. Simple heuristics are also shown and tested using the convex optimization tools.},

abstract={We consider a packet switched wireless network in which a base station serves the mobiles. The packets for the mobiles arrive at the base station and have to be scheduled for transmission to the mobiles. The capacity of the channel from the base station to the mobiles is varying with time due to fading. We assume the mobiles can obtain different types of service based on the prices they are willing to pay. The objective of the base station is to schedule packets for transmission to mobiles to maximize the revenue earned. Our main result is that a simple greedy algorithm does at least 1/2 as good as the optimal offline algorithm that knows the complete future request pattern and channel conditions.

pages={497-505 vol.2},
abstract={Congestion control algorithms used in the Internet are difficult to analyze or simulate on a large scale, i.e., when there are large numbers of nodes, links and sources in a network. The reasons for this include the complexity of the actual implementation of the algorithm and the randomness introduced in the packet arrival and service processes due to many factors such as arrivals and departures of sources and uncontrollable short flows in the network. To make the simulation tractable, often deterministic fluid model approximations of these algorithms are used. These approximations are in the form of either deterministic delay differential equations, or more generally, deterministic functional differential equations. We justify the use of deterministic models for proportionally fair congestion controllers under a limiting regime where the number of sources in a network is large. We verify our results through simulations of window-based implementations of proportionally fair controllers and TCP.},

abstract={With the explosive use of the Internet, contemporary Web servers are susceptible to overloads and their services deteriorate drastically and often cause denial of services. In this paper, we propose two methods to prevent and control overloads in Web servers by utilizing the session-based relationship among HTTP requests. We first exploited the dependence among session-based requests by analyzing and predicting the reference patterns. Using the dependency relationships, we have derived traffic conformation functions that can be used for capacity planning and overload prevention in Web servers. Second, we have proposed a dynamic weighted fair sharing (DWFS) scheduling algorithm to control overloads in Web servers. DWFS is distinguished from other scheduling algorithms in the sense that it aims to avoid processing of requests that belong to sessions that are likely to be aborted in the near future. The experimental results demonstrate that DWFS can improve server responsiveness by as high as 50% while providing QoS support through service differentiation for a class of application environment.},

year={2002},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={525-534 vol.2},
abstract={Typically, NACK-based congestion control is dismissed as being not viable due to the common notion that "open-loop" congestion control is simply "difficult." Emerging real-time streaming applications, however, often rely on rate-based flow control and would benefit greatly from scalable NACK-based congestion control. This paper sheds new light on the performance of NACK-based congestion control and measures the amount of "difficulty" inherently present in such protocols. We specifically focus on increase-decrease (I-D) congestion control methods for real-time, rate-based streaming. First, we introduce and study several new performance measures that can be used to analyze the class of general I-D congestion control methods. These measures include monotonicity of convergence to fairness and packet-loss scalability (explained in the paper). Second, under the assumptions that the only feedback from the network is packet loss, we show that AIMD is the only TCP-friendly method with monotonic convergence to fairness. Furthermore, we find that AIMD possesses the best packet-loss scalability among all TCP-friendly binomial schemes and show how poorly all of the existing methods scale as the number of flows is increased. Third, we show that if the flows can obtain the knowledge of an additional network parameter (i.e., the bottleneck bandwidth), the scalability of AIMD can be substantially improved. We conclude the paper by studying the performance of a new scheme, called ideally-scalable congestion control (ISCC), both in simulation and a NACK-based MPEG-4 streaming application over a Cisco testbed.},

abstract={We measure and analyze the single-hop packet delay through operational routers in a backbone IP network. First we present our delay measurements through a single router. Then we identify step-by-step the factors contributing to single-hop delay. In addition to packet processing, transmission, and queueing delays, we identify the presence of very large delays due to non-work-conserving router behavior. We use a simple output queue model to separate those delay components. Our step-by-step methodology used to ohtain the pure queueing delay is easily applicable to any single-hop delay measurements. After obtaining the queueing delay, we analyze the tail of its distribution, and find that it is long tailed and fits a Weihull distrihution with the scale parameter, a = 0.5, and the shape parameter, b = 0.58 to 0.6. The measured average queueing delay is larger than predicted by M/M/l, M/G/l, and FBM models when the link utilization is below 70%, but its absolute value is quite small.},

abstract={A novel scheme for processing packets in a router is presented, which provides for load sharing among multiple network processors distributed within the router. It is complemented by a feedback control mechanism designed to prevent processor overload. Incoming traffic is scheduled to multiple processors based on a deterministic mapping. The mapping formula is derived from the robust hash routing (also known as the highest random weight - HRW) scheme, introduced in K.W. Ross, IEEE Network, vol. 11, no. 6 (1997), and D.G. Thaler et al, IEEE Trans. Networking, vol. 6, no. 1 (1998). No state information on individual flow mapping needs to be stored, but for each packet, a mapping function is computed over an identifier vector, a predefined set of fields in the packet. An adaptive extension to the HRW scheme is provided in order to cope with biased traffic patterns. We prove that our adaptation possesses the minimal disruption property with respect to the mapping and exploit that property in order to minimize the probability of flow reordering. Simulation results indicate that the scheme achieves significant improvements in processor utilization. A higher number of router interfaces can thus be supported with the same amount of processing power.},

abstract={A multigigabit IP router may receive several million packets per second from each input link. For each packet, the router needs to find the longest matching prefix in the forwarding table in order to determine the packet's next-hop. In this paper, we present an efficient hardware solution for the IP address lookup problem. We model the address lookup problem as a searching problem on a binary-trie. The binary-trie is partitioned into four levels of fixed size 255-node subtrees. We employ a hierarchical indexing structure to facilitate direct access to subtrees in a given level. It is estimated that a forwarding table with 40 K prefixes will consume 2.5 Mbytes of memory. The searching is implemented using a hardware pipeline with a minimum cycle of 12.5 ns if the memory modules are implemented using SRAM. A distinguishing feature of our design is that forwarding table entries are not replicated in the data structure. Hence, table updates can be done in constant time with only a few memory accesses.},

abstract={Continuing growth in optical link speeds places increasing demands on the performance of Internet routers, while deployment of embedded and distributed network services imposes new demands for flexibility and programmability. IP address lookup has become a significant performance bottleneck for the highest performance routers. Amid the vast array of academic and commercial solutions to the problem, few achieve a favorable balance of performance, efficiency, and cost. New commercial products utilize content addressable memory (CAM) devices to achieve high lookup speeds at an exorbitantly high hardware cost with limited flexibility. In contrast, this paper describes an efficient, scalable lookup engine design, able to achieve high performance with the use of a small portion of a reconfigurable logic device and a commodity random access memory (RAM) device. The Fast Internet Protocol Lookup (FIPL) engine is an implementation of Eatherton and Dittia's previously unpublished Tree Bitmap algorithm (1998) targeted to an open-platform research router. FIPL can be scaled to achieve guaranteed worst-case performance of over 9 million lookups per second with a single SRAM operating at the fairly modest clock speed of 100 MHz. Experimental evaluation of FIPL throughput, latency, and update performance is provided using a sample routing table from Mae West.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of determining an optimal topology for Bluetooth wireless personal area networks (BT-WPAN). In BT-WPAN, multiple communication channels are available, thanks to the use of a frequency hopping technique. The way network nodes are grouped to share the same channel, and which nodes are selected to bridge traffic from a channel to another, has a significant impact on the capacity and the throughput of the system, as well as the nodes' battery lifetime. The determination of an optimal topology is thus extremely important; nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this problem is tackled here for the first time. Our optimization approach is based on a model derived from constraints that are specific to the BT-WPAN technology, but the level of abstraction of the model is such that it can be related to the more general field of ad hoc networking. By using a min-max formulation, we find the optimal topology that provides full network connectivity, fulfills the traffic requirements and the constraints posed by the system specification, and minimizes the traffic load of the most congested node in the network, or equivalently its energy consumption. Results show that a topology optimized for some traffic requirements is also remarkably robust to changes in the traffic pattern. Due to the problem complexity, the optimal solution is attained in a centralized manner. Although this implies severe limitations, a centralized solution can be applied whenever a network coordinator is elected, and provides a useful term of comparison for any distributed heuristics.},

First, we derive the energy-consumption performance analytically for uplink data transmissions under the PCF. From the evaluation results, we observe that significant energy savings can be achieved by combining TPC with adaptive PHY rate selection. A key requirement for a transmitter to select the most energy-efficient combination of transmit power level and PHY rate is the knowledge of the path loss between the receiver and itself. We present a novel scheme for accurate path loss estimation in 802.11 WLAN.

abstract={Different wireless systems sharing the same frequency band and operating in the same environment are likely to interfere with each other and experience a severe decrease in throughput. We consider IEEE 802.11 WLANs and Bluetooth-based WPANs, which operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM bands. We propose two coexistence mechanisms based on traffic scheduling techniques, which mitigate interference between the two technologies. The proposed algorithms can be applied either when 802.11 and Bluetooth are able to exchange information as well as when they operate independently of one another. Results show that through the proposed coexistence mechanisms the interference between 802.11 and Bluetooth can be reduced and the throughput of the two systems is significantly improved at the expense of a small additional delay in the transfer of data traffic.},

abstract={IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) is proposed to support asynchronous and time bounded delivery of radio data packets in infrastructure and ad hoc networks. The basis of the IEEE 802.11 WLAN MAC protocol is a distributed coordination function (DCF), which is a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) with a binary slotted exponential back-off scheme. Since IEEE 802.11 MAC has its own characteristics that are different from other wireless MAC protocols, the performance of reliable transport protocol over 802.11 needs further study. This paper proposes a scheme named DCF+, which is compatible with DCF, to enhance the performance of reliable transport protocol over WLAN. To analyze the performance of DCF and DCF+, this paper also introduces an analytical model to compute the saturated throughput of WLAN. Compared with other models, this model is shown to be able to predict the behavior of 802.11 more accurately. Moreover, DCF+ is able to improve the performance of TCP over WLAN, which is verified by modeling and elaborate simulation results.},

abstract={C. Faloutsos et al. (see Proc. ACM SIGCOMM, 1999) found that the inter autonomous system (AS) topology exhibits a power-law vertex degree distribution. This result was quite unexpected in the networking community and stirred significant interest in exploring the possible causes of this phenomenon. The work of A.-L. Barabasi and R. Albert (see Science, p.509-512, 1999) and its application to network topology generation in the work of A. Medina et al. (see Proc. MASCOTS, 2001) have explored a promising class of models that yield strict power-law vertex degree distributions. We re-examine the BGP (border gateway protocol) measurements that form the basis for the results reported by Faloutsos et al. We find that by their very nature (i.e., being strictly BGP-based), the data provides a very incomplete picture of Internet connectivity at the AS level. The AS connectivity maps constructed from this data (original maps) typically miss 20-50% or even more of the physical links in AS maps constructed using additional sources (extended maps). Subsequently, we find that while the vertex degree distributions resulting from the extended maps are heavy-tailed, they deviate significantly from a strict power law. Finally, we show that available historical data does not support the connectivity-based dynamics assumed by Barabasi and Albert. Together, our results suggest that the Internet topology at the AS level may well have developed over time following a very different set of growth processes than those proposed by Barabasi and Albert.},

abstract={The delivery of IP traffic through the Internet depends on the complex interactions between thousands of autonomous systems (AS) that exchange routing information using the border gateway protocol (BGP). This paper investigates the topological structure of the Internet in terms of customer-provider and peer-peer relationships between autonomous systems, as manifested in BGP routing policies. We describe a technique for inferring AS relationships by exploiting partial views of the AS graph available from different vantage points. Next we apply the technique to a collection of ten BGP routing tables to infer the relationships between neighboring autonomous systems. Based on these results, we analyze the hierarchical structure of the Internet and propose a five-level classification of AS. Our characterization differs from previous studies by focusing on the commercial relationships between autonomous systems rather than simply the connectivity between the nodes.},

abstract={The development and deployment of distributed network-aware applications and services require the ability to compile and maintain a model of the underlying network resources with respect to (one or more) characteristic properties of interest. To be manageable, such models must be compact, and to be general-purpose, they should enable a representation of properties along temporal, spatial, and measurement resolution dimensions. We propose MINT - a general framework for the construction of such metric-induced models using end-to-end measurements. We present the basic theoretical underpinnings of MINT for a broad class of metrics obeying certain properties. We instantiate MINT for two metrics of interest, namely packet loss rates and bottleneck bandwidth. For the loss rate metric, we leverage previously proposed end-to-end techniques for the estimation of shared losses to characterize loss topologies. We present results of simulations and Internet measurements that confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our loss topology constructions over a wide range of network conditions.},

abstract={Recent work has shown that the node degree in the WWW induced graph and the autonomous system (AS) level Internet topology exhibit power laws. Since then, several algorithms have been proposed to generate such power law graphs. We evaluate the effectiveness of these generators to generate representative AS-level topologies. Our conclusions are mixed. Although they (mostly) do a reasonable job at capturing the power law exponent, they do less well in capturing the clustering phenomena exhibited by the Internet topology. Based on these results, we propose a variation of the recent incremental topology generator of R. Albert and A. Barabasi (see Phys. Rev.

abstract={We address the issue of optimal energy allocation and admission control for communications satellites in Earth orbit. These satellites receive requests for transmission as they orbit the Earth, but may not be able to serve them all, due to energy limitations. The objective is to choose which requests to serve so that the expected total reward is maximized. The special case of a single energy-constrained satellite is considered. Rewards and demands from users for transmission (energy) are random and known only at request time. Using a dynamic programming approach, an optimal policy is derived and is characterized in terms of thresholds. Furthermore, in the special case where demand for energy is unlimited, an optimal policy is obtained in dosed form. Although motivated by satellite communications, our approach is general and can be used to solve a variety of resource allocation problems in wireless communications.},

pages={657-666 vol.2},
abstract={With a view on improving user perceived performance on networks supporting elastic flows, e.g., multimedia/data file transfers, we identify the key properties that an online dynamic bandwidth allocation policy should have. We then propose a family of bandwidth allocation criteria which depends on the residual work of on-going transfers. Analysis and simulations show that allocating bandwidth in this fashion can improve the user perceived average bit transmission delay (BTD), i.e., delay/flow size, by up to 70% at 80% traffic load over traditional approaches. A simple implementation based upon TCP Reno, exemplifies how one might approach practically realizing such gains. Further studies on simple network topologies show that as the penetration of the proposed transport mechanism increases, users will have the proper incentives to upgrade from TCP Reno, and that the overall performance is better for all users once the penetration exceeds 20%.},

pages={667-675 vol.2},
abstract={There has been tremendous progress in understanding how bandwidth is shared by TCP-like connections. By associating each TCP-like connection with a utility function, the bandwidth sharing problem of TCP-like connections can be modelled as a distributed optimization problem for utility functions. However, little is known on how bandwidth is shared by HTTP-like connections through their utility functions at the TCP level. One of the main objectives of this paper is to provide a theory for bandwidth sharing of a large number of HTTP-like connections. Based on certain technical assumptions, we show that there is a utility function at the HTTP level for an HTTP-like connection and such a utility function can be derived from the utility function at the TCP level. The bandwidth is then shared by HTTP-like connections through utility functions at the HTTP level. Moreover, there is a probabilistic interpretation for how the utility function at the HTTP level is related to the utility function at the TCP level. This is done by relating utility functions to large deviation rate functions.},

We show numerically that these two metrics must be taken into account in order to support the QoS specified by each client. The effects of system loads and clients' mobility on system performance are also investigated. Even under the various distributions of mobility, the simulation results are shown to match our analytical results, implying the applicability of our analytical model to more general cases.},

abstract={Supporting quality of service (QoS) in large-scale broadband networks poses major challenges, due to the intrinsic complexity of the corresponding resource allocation problems. An important problem in this context is how to partition QoS requirements along a selected topology (path for unicast, tree for multicast). As networks grow in size, the scalability of the solution becomes increasingly important. This requires us to devise efficient algorithms, whose computational complexity is less dependent on the network size. In addition, recently proposed precomputation-based methods can be employed to facilitate scalability by significantly reducing the time needed for handling incoming requests. We present a novel solution technique to the QoS partition problem(s), based on a "divide and conquer" scheme. As opposed to previous solutions, our technique considerably reduces the computational complexity in terms of dependence on network size; moreover, it enables the development of precomputation schemes. Hence, our technique provides a scalable approach to the QoS partition problem, for both unicast and multicast. In addition, our algorithms readily generalize to support QoS routing in typical settings of large-scale networks.},

abstract={In this paper, a new preemption policy is proposed and complemented with an adaptive scheme that aims to minimize rerouting. The preemption policy combines the three main optimization criteria: number of LSP to be preempted, priority of LSP to be preempted, and amount of bandwidth to be preempted. The preemption policy is complemented by an adaptive scheme that selects LSP with lower priority and reduces their rate in order to accommodate the new high-priority LSP setup request. Heuristics for both preemption and adaptive preemption policies are derived. Simulation results show the heuristics' accuracy. Performance comparisons of a non-preemptive approach, our preemption policy, the adaptive rate policy, and the policy in use by commercial routers are included.},

pages={705-714 vol.2},
abstract={For the provision of quality of service (QoS) in the Internet, differentiated service (DiffServ) has been proposed as a cost-effective solution. Traffic is classified into several service classes with different priorities, premium class traffic being the highest. The routing algorithm used by the premium class service has significant effects on the traffic of all other classes as well as its own. Shortest hop-count routing used in the current Internet is no longer sufficient in DiffServ networks. Based on hop-by-hop routing, an optimal routing algorithm must be found for premium class traffic such that (1) it works correctly and efficiently for premium traffic; (2) it reduces negative influences (such as bandwidth starvation, excessive delay jitter, etc.) to other traffic classes. This problem, the optimal premium-class routing (OPR) problem, is NP-complete. To handle the OPR problem, first, we analyze the strength and weaknesses of two existing algorithms (widest-shortest-path algorithm and bandwidth-inversion shortest-path algorithm). Second, we apply to the OPR problem a novel heuristic algorithm, called the enhanced bandwidth-inversion shortest-path (EBSP) algorithm. We prove theoretically the correctness of the EBSP algorithm, i.e., it is a consistent and loop-free hop-by-hop routing algorithm. Our extensive simulations in different network environments show clearly that the EBSP algorithm performs better for premium class traffic in complex, heterogeneous networks than the other two hop-by-hop routing algorithms.},

abstract={This paper discusses a new approach to QoS routing, introducing the notion of algorithm resilience (i.e., its capability to adapt to network and load modifications) as the performance index of the algorithm itself, for a given network topology, load and traffic pattern. The new approach can be summarized as network graph reduction, i.e., a modification of the graph describing the network before the routing path is computed, in order to exclude from the path selection over-congested portions of the network. This solution leads to a class of two-step routing algorithms, where both steps are simple, hence allowing efficient implementation. Simulation experiments, run on randomly-generated topologies and traffic patterns, show that these routing algorithms outperform both the standard minimum hop algorithm and those QoS-based algorithms based on the same metrics but not using the notion of network graph reduction.},

abstract={We consider the problem of distributing high-quality video signals over IP multicast in large local area networks (LANs), under realtime delay constraints, and with software-only processing. In a large LAN (such as the network of a university campus, or the network of a large company), the source of channel heterogeneity that the video communications system must cope with is not that of different bandwidth constraints available to each receiver, but it is essentially variations in the available CPU power that each receiver has in order to decode the incoming signal. We propose a new architecture for a video multicast system, present the design of the different components of this system, and show results obtained in a real implementation. Our feeds consist of video encoded at about 3 Mbits/sec and 16 frames/sec, capable of tolerating the loss of about 300 Kbits/sec worth of data. Decoding is performed on Linux PCs, and the quality of our reconstructed signals degrades gracefully with the speed of the CPU on which the receiver runs.},

We assign forward error correction (FEC) codes to each layer in the encoded bit-stream according to its importance. To this end, we develop a new distortion measure that quantifies the distortion in the reconstructed mesh when part of the bit-stream is lost. Experimental results with a collection of 3D meshes have been conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our solution. They indicate that with our proposed unequal error protection (UEP), the decoded mesh quality degrades more gracefully, compared to either no error protection (NEP) or equal error protection (EEP) methods, as the packet loss rate increases.},

abstract={We consider scheduling policies for maxmin fair allocation of bandwidth in wireless ad hoc networks. We formalize the maxmin fair objective under wireless scheduling constraints. We propose a fair scheduling which assigns dynamic weights to the flows such that the weights depend on the congestion in the neighborhood and schedule the flows which constitute a maximum weighted matching. It is possible to prove analytically that this policy attains both short term and long term fairness. We consider more generalized fairness notions, and suggest mechanisms to attain these objectives.},

pages={773-781 vol.2},
abstract={With ubiquitous computing and network access, multiple network conduits are becoming available to mobile as well as static hosts. Selection of the preferred mode of data transfer is a dynamic optimization problem depending on the type of application, its bandwidth/latency/jitter requirements, current network status, cost, power consumption, battery life, and so on. Furthermore, since wireless bandwidth is likely to remain a scarce resource, we foresee scenarios wherein mobile hosts require simultaneous data transfer across multiple IP interfaces to obtain higher overall bandwidth. We present a brief overview of related work identifying schemes that might be applicable to the problem, along with their feasibility, and pros and cons. We then propose a new mechanism to aggregate the bandwidth of multiple IP links by splitting a data flow across multiple network interfaces at the IP level. Our method is transparent to transport (TCP/UDP) and higher layers. We have analyzed the performance characteristics of the aggregation scheme and demonstrated significant gain when the links being aggregated have similar bandwidth and latency. The use of multiple interfaces also enhances reliability. Our analysis identifies the conditions under which the proposed scheme, or any other scheme that stripes a single TCP connection across multiple IP links, can be used to enhance throughput. Several interesting directions for future work have also been identified.},

pages={791-800 vol.2},
abstract={In a perfectly-periodic schedule, time is divided into time-slots, and each client gets a time slot precisely every predefined number of time slots. The input to a schedule design algorithm is a frequency request for each client, and its task is to construct a perfectly periodic schedule that matches the requests as "closely" as possible. The quality of the schedule is measured by the ratios between the requested frequency and the allocated frequency for each client (either by the weighted average or by the maximum of these ratios over all clients). Periodic schedules enjoy maximal fairness, and are very useful in many contexts of asymmetric communication, e.g., push systems and Bluetooth networks. However, finding an optimal periodic schedule is NP-hard in general. Tree scheduling is a methodology for developing perfectly periodic schedules with quality guarantees by constructing trees that correspond to periodic schedules. We explore a few aspects of tree scheduling. First, noting that a complete schedule table may be exponential in size, and that using the tree for scheduling directly may require logarithmic time on average, we give algorithms that find the next client to schedule in constant amortized time, using only polynomial space in most practical cases. Second, we present a few heuristic algorithms for generating schedules, based on analysis of optimal tree-scheduling algorithms, for both the average and maximum measures. Simulation results indicate that some of these heuristics produce excellent schedules in practice, sometimes even beating the best known non-periodic schedules.},

abstract={Network survivability is a crucial requirement in high-speed optical networks. Typical approaches of providing survivability have considered the failure of a single component such as a link or a node. We consider a failure model in which any two links in the network may fail in an arbitrary order. Three loopback methods of recovering from double-link failures are presented. The first two methods require the identification of the failed links, while the third one does not. However, precomputing the backup paths for the third method is more difficult than for the first two. A heuristic algorithm that pre-computes backup paths for links is presented. Numerical results comparing the performance of our algorithm with other approaches suggests that it is possible to achieve 100% recovery from double-link failures with a modest increase in backup capacity.},

abstract={Service restorability is a key requirement in optical networks. This means that when wavelength paths are established. both a primary path and a secondary disjoint path have to be set-up, with the secondary path being used for service restoration upon primary path failure. The secondary path may possibly be shared for efficiency. The need for secondary paths imposed by the restorability requirement has to be explicitly taken into consideration in the capacity design of optical networks. However, to our knowledge, there does not exist any algorithm for network capacity design that explicitly accounts for fast restoration requirements. The contribution of this paper is the development of algorithms for optical network capacity determination with restoration being directly taken into account. The problem is formulated as a generalization of the maximum concurrent flow problem that includes restoration requirements for the two different restoration models which are commonly used in optical networks with fast restoration requirements. We then develop fully polynomial approximation schemes that solve the restorable network capacity design problem.},

abstract={We propose a framework for decentralized path selection and on-demand wavelength channel provisioning in WDM networks with routing constraints. Within this framework, the path information of choice, such as transmission quality, reliability, policy and traffic conditions, is updated following a connection request, based on a local, autonomous and service-differentiated characterization of optical network elements. It is this local and autonomous network state information that makes our approach particularly suitable for distributed implementation, and applicable to optical network architectures and control protocols that support service level guarantees. To illustrate this, we study mesh networks consisting of transparent, short-reach networking segments interconnected by long-reach WDM links with electronically regenerative gateways, where different link types show different SNR degradation, reliability and delay. On the example of electronically regenerative gateways, we address a new class of constraint-based path selection problems, where a certain a type of network element can at the same time deteriorate and improve network performance; e.g. electronic regenerators improve optical path quality and can adapt to wavelengths, but induce delays or operational costs. The performance study has shown the capability of our methods to accommodate arbitrary number and type of optical path properties, related to different network architectures and services.},

The new marking algorithm is called equation-based marking (EBM) and is based on the TCP model in Padhye et al. (1998). EBM is to handle the problems found in other marking schemes regarding fairness among heterogeneous TCP flows through a tight feedback-loop operation and adaptation of the packet marking probability to network conditions. We design a packet marker that uses EBM as the marking algorithm, and evaluate its performance using in-depth simulation. We also prove analytically the correctness of the marking algorithm and compare it with other marking schemes for different network scenarios. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of EBM in providing the required fairness among heterogeneous flows and ensuring protection against nonassured traffic.},

abstract={Many corporate WAN architects are considering migrating from costly leased line circuits to 'private IP' services. In order to do so IP service providers must provide service level agreements (SLA) that offer robust assurances that cover service availability and performance. The industry direction is to model IP SLA after those offered by frame relay networks. The reality however is that the SLA surrounding today's private IP services only loosely mirror frame relay SLA. In this paper, we examine the intent and limitations of current IP SLA. We explore the feasibility of two significant enhancements. First we study the feasibility of reducing the time scales associated with the performance assessment to something that is meaningful to the corporate end user. Second we explore the potential benefits of extending current performance assessment methods with application level performance metrics. We present preliminary results suggesting that it is possible to offer performance assurances based on carefully chosen latency objectives as long as the average utilization of the access link is less than 50% over time scales identical to those used by the performance metrics. We introduce a Web-oriented performance metric (the Web Response Time metric) and show promising benefits over traditional ping based metrics. However, for either ping or Web-based performance metrics, due to the inherent nature of a best-effort IP service, IP performance assurances are only practical when applied over long time scales.},

abstract={The Assured Forwarding (AF) service of the IETF DiffServ architecture provides a qualitative service differentiation between classes of traffic, in the sense that a low-priority class experiences higher loss rates and higher delays than a high-priority class. However, the AF service does not quantify the difference in the service given to classes. In an effort to strengthen the service guarantees of the AF service, we propose a Quantitative Assured Forwarding service with absolute and proportional differentiation of loss, service rates, and packet delays. We present a feedback-based algorithm which enforces the desired class-level differentiation on a per-hop basis, without the need for admission control or signaling. Measurement results from a testbed of FreeBSD PC-routers on a 100 Mbit/s Ethernet network show the effectiveness of the proposed service, and indicate that our implementation is suitable for networks with high data rates.},

abstract={Open shortest path first (OSPF) is a popular protocol for routing within an autonomous system (AS) domain. In this paper, we address the important practical problem of configuring OSPF aggregates to minimize the error in OSPF shortest path computations due to subnet aggregation. We first develop an optimal dynamic programming algorithm that, given an upper bound k on the number of aggregates to be advertised and a weight-assignment function for the aggregates, computes the k aggregates that result in the minimum cumulative error in the shortest path computations for all source-destination subnet pairs. Subsequently, we tackle the problem of assigning weights to OSPF aggregates such that the cumulative error in the computed shortest paths is minimized. We demonstrate that, while for certain special cases (e.g., unweighted cumulative error) efficient optimal algorithms for the weight-assignment problem can be devised, the general problem itself is /spl Nscr//spl Pscr/-hard. Consequently, we have to rely on search heuristics to solve the weight-assignment problem. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address the algorithmic issues underlying the configuration of OSPF aggregates and to propose efficient configuration algorithms that are provably optimal for many practical scenarios.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe an enhancement to OSPF, called the IBB (I'll Be Back) capability, that enables other routers to use a router whose OSPF process is inactive for forwarding traffic for a certain period of time. The IBB capability can be used for avoiding route flaps that occur when the OSPF process is brought down in a router to facilitate protocol software upgrade, operating system upgrade, router ID change, AS and interface renumbering, etc. When the OSPF process in an IBB-capable router is inactive, it cannot adapt its forwarding table to reflect changes in network topology. This can lead to routing loops and/or black holes. We provide a detailed analysis of how and when loops or black holes are formed and propose solutions to prevent them. Using the GateD platform, we have developed an IBB extension to OSPF incorporating these solutions. Using this system in an experimental setup, we demonstrate that the overhead of the IBB extension is modest compared to the benefit it offers, and has good scaling behavior in terms of network size and the number of routers with inactive OSPF processes.},

pages={912-919 vol.2},
abstract={In this article we present a new class of traffic shapers that make up the shaping decision whether to delay or pass a packet by comparing a measured distribution specifying the arrival stream to a given reference distribution. Rather than simply comparing average values this shaper emits data streams with property 'better than reference distribution' by employing a kind of nonparametric test. If all incoming data streams of the network considered are shaped according to 'better than Poisson', network dimensioning is simplified in the sense that multiplexer performance can be predicted conservatively by assuming Poisson arrivals, hence, admission control and resource dimensioning can be based on a simple M/D/1 queueing model. The presented shaping algorithm thereby provides an analytical tool for network providers to calculate upper bounds on the load in a network fed with accordingly shaped streams only. Our simulations show that the shaper presented emits data streams with corresponding distribution function almost identical to (or better than) reference distribution independent of the input arrival process but on the other hand introduces no serious delays if the arriving stream is already 'better than reference'. Moreover the shaper is mostly robust in terms of shaping parameters and initial conditions and has the capability to remove correlations of the passing stream.},

abstract={Server bandwidth has been identified as a major bottleneck in large video-on-demand (VoD) systems. Using multicast delivery to serve popular content helps increase scalability by making efficient use of server bandwidth. In addition, recent research has focused on proactive schemes in which the server periodically multicasts popular content without explicit requests from clients. Proactive schemes are attractive because they consume bounded server bandwidth irrespective of client arrival rate. In this work, we describe Fuzzycast, a scalable periodic multicast scheme that uses simple techniques to provide video on demand at reasonable client start-up times while consuming optimal server bandwidth. We present a theoretical analysis of its bandwidth and client buffer requirements and prove its optimality. We study the effect of variable bitrate (VBR) media on Fuzzycast performance and propose a simple extension to transmit VBR media over constant-rate channels. Finally, we solve the problem of partitioning a transmission over multiple multicast groups by considering it as a specific instance of a more widely encountered resource trade-off.},

abstract={In this paper we evaluate the situations in which CBM is advantageous. The benefits of CBM depend critically upon how well filters are placed at interior nodes of the IP multicast tree, and the costs depend upon those introduced by filters themselves. Further, we consider the benefits of allowing the filters to be mobile so as to respond to user mobility or changes in user interests, and the corresponding costs of filter mobility. We consider two criteria: minimizing total network bandwidth utilization and minimizing mean information delivery delay. For each criterion we develop an optimal filter placement algorithm, as well as a heuristic that executes faster than the optimal algorithm. Finally, we evaluate all the algorithms by means of simulation experiments. Our results indicate that filters can be effective in substantially reducing bandwidth and delay. We also find filter mobility is worthwhile if there is sufficient locality in the interests of users, or there is marked large-scale user mobility. We conclude with suggestions for further work.},

pages={940-949 vol.2},
abstract={Cache pre-filling is emerging as a new concept for increasing the availability of popular Web items in cache servers. According to this concept, Web items are sent by a "push-server" to the proxy cache servers, usually through a broadcast-based or a multicast-based distribution mechanism. One of the most difficult challenges is to design the scheduling algorithm of the push-server. This algorithm needs to determine the "broadcast scheduling map", namely which Web items to broadcast and when. In this paper we study the approach where every constant period of time each proxy cache analyzes the requests it has received in the past and determines which Web item it prefers to receive by broadcast and when. We formalize a related problem, called the "cache pre-filing push" (CPFP) problem, analyze its computational complexity, and describe efficient algorithms to solve it.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of energy efficiency in ad hoc wireless networks. We consider a network that is shared by a set of sources, each one communicating with its corresponding destination using multiple routes. Each source is associated with a utility function which increases with the total traffic flowing over the available source-destination routes. The network lifetime is defined as the time until the first node in the network runs out of energy. We formulate the problem as one of maximizing the sum of the sources' utilities subject to the required constraint on network lifetime. We present a primal formulation of the problem, which uses penalty functions to take into account the system constraints, and we introduce a new methodology for solving the problem. The proposed approach leads to a flow control algorithm, which provides the optimal sources' rate and can be easily implemented in a distributed manner. When compared with the minimum transmission energy routing scheme, the proposed algorithm gives significantly higher sources' rates for same network lifetime guarantee.},

abstract={We consider the application of the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methodology to the problem of joint mobility tracking and hard handoff detection in cellular wireless communication networks based on the pilot signal strength measurements. The dynamics of the system under consideration are described by a nonlinear state-space model. Mobility tracking involves an on-line estimation of the location and velocity of the mobile, whereas handoff detection involves an on-line prediction of the pilot signal strength at some future time instants. The optimal solution to both problems is prohibitively complex due to the nonlinear nature of the system. The sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are therefore employed to track the probabilistic dynamics of the system and to make the corresponding estimates and predictions. Hard handoff initiation is considered and two novel locally optimal handoff schemes are developed based on different criteria. It is seen that under the SMC framework, optimal mobility tracking and handoff detection can be implemented naturally in a joint fashion, and significant improvement is achieved over existing methods, in terms of both the tracking accuracy and the trade-off between service quality and resource utilization during hard handoff.},

abstract={In this paper we introduce power control as a solution to the multiple access problem in contention-based wireless ad-hoc networks. The motivation for this study is two fold, limiting multi-user interference to increase single-hop throughput, and reducing power consumption to increase battery life. We focus on next neighbor transmissions where nodes are required to send information packets to their respective receivers subject to a constraint on the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. The multiple access problem is solved via two alternating phases, namely scheduling and power control. The scheduling algorithm is essential to coordinate the transmissions of independent users in order to eliminate strong interference (e.g. self-interference) that can not be overcome by power control. On the other hand, power control is executed in a distributed fashion to determine the admissible power vector, if one exists, that can be used by the scheduled users to satisfy their single-hop transmission requirements. This is done for two types of networks, namely TDMA and TDMA/CDMA wireless ad-hoc networks.},

abstract={A key criterion in the design of high-speed networks is the probability that the buffer content exceeds a given threshold. We consider n independent identical traffic sources modelled as point processes, which are fed into a link with speed proportional to n. Under fairly general assumptions on the input processes we show that the steady state probability of the buffer content exceeding a threshold b>0 tends to the corresponding probability assuming Poisson input processes. We verify the assumptions for a large class of long-range dependent sources commonly used to model data traffic. Our results show that with superposition, significant multiplexing gains can be achieved for even smaller buffers than suggested by previous results, which consider O(n) buffer size. Moreover, simulations show that for realistic values of the exceedance probability and moderate utilisations, convergence to the Poisson limit takes place at reasonable values of the number of sources superposed. This is particularly relevant for high-speed networks in which the cost of high-speed memory is significant.},

abstract={We consider stochastic guarantees for networks with aggregate scheduling, in particular, Expedited Forwarding (EF). Our approach is based on the assumption that a node can be abstracted by a service curve, and the input flows are regulated individually at the network ingress. Both of these assumptions are in line with EF. For a service curve node, we derive bounds on the complementary distributions of the steady-state backlog and backlog as seen by packet arrivals. We also give a bound on the long-run loss ratio for a service curve node where the buffer size is too small to guarantee loss-free operation. For a packet scale rate guarantee node, we use the delay from the backlog bound to obtain a probabilistic bound on the delay. Our analysis is exact under the given assumptions. Our results should help us to understand the performance of networks with aggregate scheduling, and provide the basis for dimensioning such networks.},

pages={1014-1023 vol.2},
abstract={This paper is about analytical models for calculating the average bandwidth shares obtained by TCP controlled finite file transfers that arrive randomly and share a single (bottleneck) link. Owing to the complex nature of the TCP congestion control algorithm, a single model does not work well for all combinations of network parameters (i.e., mean file size, link capacity, and propagation delay). We propose two models, develop their analyses, and identify the regions of their applicability. One model is obtained from a detailed analysis of TCP's AIMD adaptive window mechanism; the analysis accounts for session arrivals and departures, and finite link buffers. It is essentially a processor sharing (PS) model with time varying service rate; hence we call it TCP-PS. The other model is a simple modification of the PS model that accounts for large propagation delays; we call this model rate limited-PS (RL-PS). The TCP-PS model analysis accommodates a general file size distribution by approximating it with a mixture of exponentials. The RL-PS model can be used for general file size distributions. We show that the TCP-PS model converges to the standard PS model as the propagation delay approaches zero. We also observe that the PS model provides very poor estimates of throughput unless the propagation delay is very small. We observe that the key parameters affecting the throughput are the bandwidth delay product (BDP), file size distribution, the link buffer and the traffic intensity. Several numerical comparisons between analytical and simulation results are provided. We observe that the TCP-PS model is accurate when the BDP is small compared to the mean file size, and the RL-PS model works well when the BDP is large compared to the mean file size.},

year={2002},
volume={2},

pages={1024-1031 vol.2},
abstract={Input Queued (IQ) switch architecture has been of interest due to its low memory bandwidth requirement. A scheduling algorithm is required to schedule the transfer of packets through cross-bar switch fabric at every time slot. The performance, that is throughput and delay, of a switch depends on the scheduling algorithm. The maximum weight matching (MWM) algorithm is known to deliver 100% throughput under any admissible traffic. Leonardi et. al. (2001) obtained a nontrivial bound on the delay for the MWM algorithm under admissible Bernoulli i.i.d. traffic. There has been a lot of interesting work done over time to analyze throughput of scheduling algorithms. But apart from the work of Leonardi et al. there has not been any work done to obtain bounds on delay of scheduling algorithms. The MWM algorithm is perceived to be a very good scheduling algorithm in general and simulations have suggested that it performs better than most of the known algorithms in terms of delay. But it is very complex to implement. Hence many simple to implement approximations to MWM have been proposed. In this paper, we study a class of approximation algorithms to MWM, which always obtain a schedule whose weight W differs from the weight of MWM schedule W* by at most f(W*), where f(.) is a sub-linear function. We call this difference in weight as "approximation distance" of algorithm from MWM. We denote this class of algorithms by 1-APRX. We prove that any 1-APRX algorithm is stable, that is, it delivers upto 100% of throughput under any admissible Bernoulli i.i.d. input traffic. Under any admissible Bernoulli i.i.d. traffic, we obtain bounds on the average queue length(equivalently delay) of the 1-APRX algorithms using a Lyapunov function technique, which was motivated in Leonardi et al. The delay bounds obtained for the 1-APRX algorithm are linearly related with the "approximation distance", which matches the intuition that the better the weight of the schedule, the better the algorithm will perform. Interestingly, simulations show a linear relationship between the average queue length (equivalently delay) and the "approximation distance". Thus, the "approximation distance" of a scheduling algorithm can serve as a metric to differentiate between the performance of different stable algorithms, even though throughput may be same for these algorithms. We also obtain a novel heuristic tighter bound on the average queue length (equivalently delay) under uniform Bernoulli i.i.d. traffic for MWM using a very simple argument.},

abstract={High performance packet switches frequently use a centralized scheduler (also known as an arbiter) to determine the configuration of a non-blocking crossbar. The scheduler often limits the scalability of the system because of the frequency and complexity of its decisions. A paper by C.-S. Chang et al. (2001) introduced an interesting two-stage switch, in which each stage uses a trivial deterministic sequence of configurations. The switch is simple to implement at high speed and has been proved to provide 100% throughput for a broad class of traffic. Furthermore, there is a bound between the average delay of the two-stage switch and that of an ideal output-queued switch. However, in its simplest form, the switch mis-sequences packets by an arbitrary amount. In this paper, building on the two-stage switch, we present an algorithm called full frames first (FFF), that prevents mis-sequencing while maintaining the performance benefits (in terms of throughput and delay) of the basic two-stage switch. FFF comes at some additional cost, which we evaluate in this paper.},

abstract={This paper deals with a novel buffer management scheme based on evolutionary computing for shared-memory ATM switches. The philosophy behind it is adaptation of the threshold for each output logical queue to the real traffic conditions by means of a system of fuzzy inferences. The optimal fuzzy system is achieved using a systematic methodology based on genetic algorithms for membership-function selecting and tuning. This methodology approach allows the fuzzy system parameters to be automatically derived when the switch parameters vary, offering a high degree of scalability to the fuzzy control system. Its performance is very close to that of an ideal mechanism like the push-out mechanism, and at any rate much better than that of the threshold schemes based on conventional logic. In addition it is simple to implement and above all inexpensive when implemented using VLSI technology.},

pages={1049-1058 vol.2},
abstract={Enhanced network services often involve allocating resources (bandwidth/buffer space) preferentially to packets belonging to certain flows or traffic classes. Such services are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks if packet classification is based on information that can be forged, such as source and destination addresses and port numbers. Traditional message authentication codes (MACs), often considered the only solution to this problem, are really not designed to solve it. In particular, their per-packet costs are so high that they enable another form of denial-of-service attack based on overwhelming the verification mechanism. We describe the problem of denial of access to reserved resources and the inadequacies of conventional solutions. We then observe that it is reasonable to trade some of the strong security guarantees provided by conventional MACs for a lower per-packet cost. We propose a new packet authentication algorithm, designed to solve the problem of protecting reserved resources, with a very low, fixed per-packet cost. While it cannot replace conventional MACs for end-to-end authentication, we argue that it is a better solution for the problem considered here. We present measurements from a prototype implementation that can verify a packet of arbitrary size in as few as 1000 machine cycles on an Intel architecture machine.},

abstract={A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a multi-hop wireless network capable of autonomous operation. The mobility of MANET nodes can lead to frequent and unpredictable topology changes. Most MANET literature assumes that network related information of a node (such as its IP address, netmask, etc.) is configured statically, prior to the node joining the MANET. However, not all nodes have IP addresses permanently assigned to them. Such nodes rely on a centralized server and use a dynamic host configuration protocol, like DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol), to acquire an IP address. Such a solution cannot be employed in MANETs due to the unavailability of any centralized DHCP server. In this paper, we first present a survey of possible solutions approaches, and discuss their limitations. Then, we present a distributed dynamic host configuration protocol designed to configure nodes in a MANET. We show that the proposed protocol works correctly and does not have the limitations of earlier approaches. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the solution through simulation experiments, and conclude with a discussion of related security issues.},

pages={1069-1078 vol.2},
abstract={Mobile IP is a simple and scalable global mobility solution. However, it may cause excessive signaling traffic and long signaling delay. Mobile IP regional registration is proposed to reduce the number of location updates to the home network, and reduce the signaling delay. This paper introduces a novel distributed and dynamic regional location management for Mobile IP where the signaling burden is evenly distributed and the regional network boundary is dynamically adjusted according to the up-to-date mobility and traffic load for each terminal. In our distributed system, each user has its own optimized system configuration, which results in minimal signaling traffic. In order to find the signaling cost function, a new discrete analytical model is developed which captures the mobility and packet arrival pattern of a mobile terminal. This model does not impose any restrictions on the shape and the geographic location of subnets in the Internet. Given the average total location update and packet delivery cost, an iterative algorithm is then used to determine the optimal regional network size. Analytical results show that our distributed dynamic scheme outperforms the IETF Mobile IP regional registration scheme for various scenarios in terms of reducing the overall signaling cost. Using our approach, the system robustness is also enhanced.},

abstract={We consider a large-scale wireless network, but with a low density of nodes per unit area. Interferences are then less critical, contrary to connectivity. This paper studies the latter property for both a purely ad-hoc network and a hybrid network, where fixed base stations can be reached in multiple hops. We assume here that power constraints are modeled by a maximal distance above which two nodes are not (directly) connected. We find that the introduction of a sparse network of base stations does significantly help in increasing the connectivity, but only when the node density is much larger in one dimension than in the other. We explain the results by percolation theory. We obtain analytical expressions of the probability of connectivity in the 1D case. We also show that at a low spatial density of nodes, bottlenecks are unavoidable. Results obtained on actual population data confirm our findings.},

year={2002},
volume={2},

pages={1089-1098 vol.2},
abstract={In wireless ad-hoc networks, the network topology changes dynamically and unpredictably due to node mobility. Such topological dynamics are further exacerbated by the natural grouping behavior in the mobile user's movement, which leads to frequent network partitioning. Network partitioning poses significant challenges to the provisioning of centralized services in ad-hoc networks, since partitioning disconnects many mobile users from the central server. We propose a collection of novel run-time algorithms that adaptively ensure the centralized service is available to all mobile nodes during network partitioning, while minimizing the number of servers required. The network-wide service coverage is achieved by partition prediction and service replication on the servers, and assisted by distributed service selection on regular mobile nodes. Simulation results show that our algorithm efficiently achieves guaranteed service coverage to all nodes. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no similar approaches that use partition prediction to provision centralized services adaptively in partitionable mobile ad-hoc networks.},

title={Stability of a multicast tree},

volume={2},

pages={1099-1108 vol.2},
abstract={Most of the currently deployed multicast protocols (e.g. DVMRP, PIM, MOSPF) build one shortest path multicast tree per sender, the tree being rooted at the sender's subnetwork. This paper examines the stability of such a tree, specifically, how the number of links change as the number of multicast users in a group changes. We make two modelling assumptions: (a) packets are delivered along the shortest path tree; (b) the m multicast group member nodes are chosen uniformly out of the total number of nodes N. The probability density function for the number of changed edges, /spl Delta//sub N/(m), when one multicast user joins or leaves the group is studied. For random graphs of the class G/sub p/(N) with N nodes, link density p and with uniformly (or exponentially) distributed link weights, the probability density function, Pr[/spl Delta//sub N/(m)=k], is proved to tend to a Poisson distribution for large N. The proof of this theorem enables a generalization to an arbitrary topology. Simulations, mainly conducted to quantify the validity of the asymptotic regime, reveal that the Poisson law seems more widely valid than just in the asymptotic regime where N/spl rarr//spl infin/. In addition, the effect of the link weight distribution on the stability of the multicast tree is investigated. Finally, via simulations, the stability of a Steiner tree connecting m multicast users is compared to the shortest path tree.},

abstract={We propose an efficient on-line estimation algorithm for determining the size of a dynamic multicast group. By using diffusion approximation and a Kalman filter, we derive an estimator that minimizes the mean square of the estimation error. As opposed to previous studies, where the size of the multicast group is supposed to be fixed throughout the estimation procedure, we consider a dynamic estimation scheme that updates the estimation at every observation step. The robustness of our estimator to violation of the assumptions under which it has been derived is addressed via simulations. Further validations of our approach are carried out on real audio traces.},

pages={1119-1128 vol.2},
abstract={Recently proposed streaming protocols are able to deliver multimedia files on-demand with the required server bandwidth growing only logarithmically with the file request rate. The same efficiencies are achieved for network bandwidth if delivery is over a true broadcast channel. This paper considers the required network bandwidth for on-demand streaming over multicast delivery trees. We consider both simple canonical delivery trees, and more complex cases in which delivery trees are constructed using both existing and new algorithms for various randomly generated network topologies and client site locations. Our results quantify the potential savings from the use of multicast trees that are configured to minimize network bandwidth rather than the latency to the content server. Further, we show that it is possible to achieve reasonably close to the minimum possible bandwidth usage for both network and server simultaneously, with a practical on-demand streaming protocol.},

abstract={Advances in wireless and optical communication, as well as in Internet multicast protocols, make broadcast and multicast methods an effective solution to disseminate data. In particular, repetitive server-initiated broadcast is an effective technique in wireless systems and is a scalable solution to relieve Internet hot spots. A critical issue for the performance of multicast data dissemination is the multicast schedule. Previous work focused on a model where each data item is requested by clients with a certain probability that is independent of past accesses. We consider the more complex scenario where a client accesses pages in blocks (e.g., a HTML file and all its embedded images), thereby introducing dependencies in the pattern of accesses to data. We present a sequence of heuristics that exploit page access dependencies. We measured the resulting client-perceived delay on multiple Web server traces, and observed an average speed-up over previous methods ranging from 8% to 91%. We conclude that scheduling for multi-item requests is a critical factor for the performance of repetitive broadcast.},
