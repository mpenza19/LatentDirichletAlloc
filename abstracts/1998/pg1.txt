title={Performance of ATM switches with age priority packet discarding under the on-off source model},
year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={931-938 vol.3},
abstract={In the current ATM AAL5 implementation, even a single cell loss event can lead to the corruption of one whole packet. Hence, it has been observed that the throughput of the upper layer protocol may easily collapse on a congested ATM network. We propose a buffer management method called age priority packet discarding (APPD) scheme to be used along with two other schemes: the early packet discarding (EPD) and the partial packet discarding (PPD) schemes. After describing the operations and the pseudo code of the proposed APPD scheme and how it operates with the EPD/PPD schemes, the packet level QoS of APPD and its extended versions are derived analytically under homogeneous on-off source model. Numerical results obtained via, analytical approach suggest that the proposed APPD scheme can more effectively and fairly reduce the packet loss probability than other schemes.},

title={A delay and loss versatile scheduling discipline in ATM switches},
year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={939-946 vol.3},
abstract={We propose a versatile scheduling discipline, called precedence with partial push-out (PPP), in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches supporting two delay and two loss priorities. By employing a threshold L, PPP provides delay guarantee by allowing a newly-arriving high-delay-priority cell to precede a maximum of L low-delay-priority cells. Through the use of another threshold R, the discipline offers loss guarantee by permitting a newly-arriving high-loss-priority cell to push out the last low-loss-priority cell located beyond the Rth location in a full queue. By setting L and R properly, PPP versatilely performs as any one of the four widely-accepted disciplines, namely the FCFS, head-of-line, push-out, or head-of-line with push-out disciplines. To determine L and R retaining demanded quality of services (QoSs), we provide an in-depth queueing analysis for the cell delay (CD) and cell loss ratio (CLR) of high-delay-priority low-loss-priority cells. We further propose a simple, algebra-based analysis for the CD and CLR for low-delay-priority, high-loss-priority cells. On the basis of these analyses, L and R can be dynamically and effectively adjusted to provide adequate delay and loss guarantees for high-priority cells while incurring only minimal performance degradation for other classes of cells. Finally, the paper presents simulation results confirming the accuracy of the analyses.},

abstract={This paper evaluates the additional buffer requirements of an ATM shared-memory switch using packet-level (store-and-forward) rather than cell-level (cut-through) service scheduling. Packet-level scheduling is important to tag and IP switching for multipoint-to-one services; it allows different connections to be merged into a single virtual connection to reduce routing complexity.

year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={955-963 vol.3},
abstract={This paper presents a new communication service for ATM networks that provides one-way, adjustable rate, on-demand communication channels. The proposed dynamic flow service is designed to operate within a multi-service cell switched network that supports both conventional switched virtual circuits and IP packet routing and is designed to complement those services. It is particularly well suited to applications that transmit substantial amounts of data (a few tens of kilobytes or more) in fairly short time periods (up to a few seconds). Much of the current World-Wide Web traffic falls within this domain. Like IP packet networks, the new service permits the transmission of data without prior end-to-end connection establishment. It uses a variant of ATM resource management cells to carry dynamic flow setup information along with the data, including an IP destination address and burst transmission rate. Switches along the path select next an outgoing link dynamically using the burst rate to guide the routing decision. The dynamic flow setup protocol is based on soft-state control and is designed to facilitate the use of buffers that are shared across all ports of a switch, minimizing per port memory costs.},

pages={964-971 vol.3},
abstract={We investigate the scalability of feedback in multicast communication and propose a new method of probabilistic feedback based on exponentially distributed timers. By analysis and simulation for up to 10/sup 6/ receivers we show that feedback implosion is avoided while feedback latency is low. The mechanism is robust against the loss of feedback messages and robust against homogeneous and heterogeneous delays. We apply the feedback mechanism to reliable multicasting and compare it to existing timer-based feedback schemes. Our mechanism achieves lower NAK (loss signaling) latency for the same performance in terms of NAK suppression. It is scalable, the amount of state at every group member is independent of the number of receivers. No topological information of the network is used and data delivery is the only support required from the network. It adapts to the number of receivers and leads therefore to a constant performance for implosion avoidance and feedback latency.},

year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={972-979 vol.3},
abstract={We examine the impact of the loss recovery mechanisms on the performance of a reliable multicast protocol. Approaches to reliable multicast can be divided into two major classes: source-based recovery, and distributed recovery. For both classes we consider the state of the art: for source-based recovery, a type 2 hybrid ARQ scheme with parity retransmission; for distributed recovery, a scheme with local multicast retransmission and local feedback processing. We further show the benefits of combining the two approaches and consider a type 2 hybrid ARQ scheme with local retransmission. The schemes are compared for up to 10/sup 6/ receivers under different loss scenarios with respect to network bandwidth usage and completion time of a reliable transfer. We show that the protocol based on local retransmissions via type 2 hybrid ARQ performs best for bandwidth and latency. For networks, where local retransmission is not possible, we show that a protocol based on type 2 hybrid ARQ comes close to the performance of a protocol with local retransmissions.},

year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={980-987 vol.3},
abstract={This paper presents algorithms, heuristics and lower bounds addressing optimization issues in many-to-many multicasting. Two main problems are addressed: (1) a precise combinatorial comparison of optimal multicast trees with optimal multicast rings, (2) an optimized sharing of network resources (i.e., nodes and links) among multiple multicast groups that coexist. The former is central to the choice of multicast protocols and their performance, while the latter is crucial for network utilization. The first problem is treated as a comparison of Steiner tree and traveling salesman problems on the same input set. The underlying integer programming problems are solved to optimum by using cutting-plane inequalities and the branch-and-cut algorithm. In addition to these exact solutions, fast heuristics are presented for approximate solutions. The second problem is formulated as a packing problem in which the network tries to accommodate all the multicast groups by optimizing the utilization of resources. Precise mathematical programming formulations, lower bounds and a heuristic for the underlying optimization problem are presented. The heuristic aims to accommodate multiple multicast groups while avoiding bottlenecks on the links for higher throughput. The heuristics and exact algorithms are implemented on various networks and multicast groups. The simulations show that multicast trees can be built by using 25% fewer links than the rings, both for optimal and suboptimal constructions. The packing heuristic is also implemented and its performance is compared to the constructive lower bound.},

year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={988-995 vol.3},
abstract={Local recovery approaches for reliable multicast have the potential to provide significant performance gains in terms of reduced bandwidth and delay, and higher system throughput. In this paper we examine two local recovery approaches-one server-based, and the other receiver-based, and compare their performance. The server-based approach makes use of specially designated hosts, called repair servers, co-located with routers inside the network. In the receiver-based approach, only the end hosts (sender and receivers) are involved in error recovery. Using analytical models, we first show that the two local recovery approaches yield significantly higher protocol throughput and lower bandwidth usage than an approach that does not use local recovery. Next, we demonstrate that server-based local recovery yields higher protocol throughput and lower bandwidth usage than receiver-based local recovery when the repair servers have processing power slightly higher than that of a receiver and several hundred kilobytes of buffer per multicast session.},

pages={996-1003 vol.3},
abstract={We present a novel congestion control algorithm suitable for use with cumulative, layered data streams in the MBone. Our algorithm behaves similarly to TCP congestion control algorithms, and shares bandwidth fairly with other instances of the protocol and with TCP flows. It is entirely receiver driven and requires no per-receiver status at the sender, in order to scale to large numbers of receivers. It relies on standard functionalities of multicast routers, and is suitable for continuous stream and reliable bulk data transfer. In the paper we illustrate the algorithm, characterize its response to losses both analytically and by simulations, and analyse its behaviour using simulations and experiments in real networks. We also show how error recovery can be dealt with independently from congestion control by using FEC techniques, so as to provide reliable bulk data transfer.},

abstract={We study a new approach to routing multi-class traffic flows with guaranteed bandwidth requirements. The approach is based on our concept of load profiling (Bestavros and Matta, 1997). We thoroughly characterize routing performance using load profiling and contrast it to routing using load balancing and load packing. We do so both analytically and via extensive simulations on virtual path (VP) based networks. Our findings confirm that load balancing is not desirable as it results in VP bandwidth fragmentation, which adversely affects the likelihood of accepting new flow requests. This fragmentation is more pronounced when the granularity of the requests is large. Our simulation results also show that our load-profiling routing scheme performs better or as well as the traditional load-balancing routing in terms of revenue under both skewed and uniform workloads. Furthermore, load-profiling routing improves routing fairness by proactively increasing the chances of admitting high-bandwidth flows.},

abstract={Although neural networks have been applied for traffic and congestion control in ATM networks, most implementations use multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks which are known to converge slowly. In this paper, we present a connection admission control (CAC) scheme which uses a modular neural network with fast learning ability to predict the cell loss ratio (CLR) at each switch in the network. A special type of OAM cell travels from the source node to the destination node and back in order to gather information at each switch. This information is used at the source to make CAC decisions such that quality of service (QoS) commitments are not violated. Experimental results which compare the performance of the proposed method with other CAC methods which use the peak cell rate (PCR), average cell rate (ACR) and equivalent bandwidth are presented.},

abstract={Mobile nodes of the future will be equiped with multiple network interfaces to take advantage of overlay networks, yet no current mobility systems provide full support for the simultaneous use of multiple interfaces. The need for such support arises when multiple connectivity options are available with different cost, coverage, latency and bandwidth characteristics, and applications want their data to flow over the interface that best matches the characteristics of the data. We present an architecture called transport layer mobility that allows mobile nodes to not only change their point of attachment to the Internet, but also to control which network interfaces are used for the different kinds of data leaving from and arriving at the mobile node. We implement our transport layer mobility scheme using a split connection proxy architecture and a new technique called TCP splice that gives split connection proxy systems the same end to-end semantics as normal TCP connections.},

This paper proposes a new protocol that (1) replaces TCP/IP over the wireless link by a simpler protocol with smaller headers, if the link is the last hop along a data path, (2) shifts functions needed to communicate with an Internet host using TCP/IP from the mobile host to the base station, so that the distinct wireless link is hidden from the outside Internet, and (3) exploits link-layer acknowledgments and retransmissions to quickly recover losses over the wireless link. Our simulation results show a substantial performance improvement achieved by the new protocol.},

The use of the concept enables the formulation of the transmitter locating task as a maximal coverage location problem (MCLP), which is well known in economics for modeling and solving facility location problems. For the network optimization task, we introduced the set cover base station positioning algorithm (SCBPA), which is based on a greedy heuristic for solving the MCLP problem.

year={1998},
volume={3},

pages={1062-1072 vol.3},
abstract={Layered video multicast with retransmissions (LVMR) is a system for distributing video using layered coding over the Internet. The two key contributions of the system are: (1) improving the quality of reception within each layer by retransmitting lost packets given an upper bound on recovery time and applying an adaptive playback point scheme to help achieve more successful retransmission, and (2) adapting to network congestion and heterogeneity using hierarchical rate control mechanism. This paper concentrates on the rate control aspects of LVMR. In contrast to the existing sender-based and receiver-based rate control in which the entire information about network congestion is either available at the sender (in sender-based approach) or replicated at the receivers (in receiver-based approach), the hierarchical rate control mechanism distributes the information between the sender, receivers, and some agents in the network in such a way that each entity maintains only the information relevant to itself. In addition to that, the hierarchical approach enables intelligent decisions to be made in terms of conducting concurrent experiments and choosing one of several possible experiments at any instant of time based on minimal state information at the agents in the network. Protocol details are presented in the paper together with experimental and simulation results to back our claims.},

abstract={Network architectures that can efficiently transport high quality, multicast video are rapidly becoming a basic requirement of emerging multimedia applications. The main problem complicating multicast video transport is variation in network bandwidth constraints. An attractive solution to this problem is to use an adaptive, multi-layered video encoding mechanism. We consider two such mechanisms for the support of video multicast; one is a rate-based mechanism that relies on explicit rate congestion feedback from the network, and the other is a credit-based mechanism that relies on hop-by-hop congestion feedback. The responsiveness, bandwidth utilization, scalability and fairness of the two mechanisms are evaluated through simulations. Results suggest that while the two mechanisms exhibit performance trade-offs, both are capable of providing a high quality video service in the presence of varying bandwidth constraints.},

title={End-to-end delay of videoconferencing over packet switched networks},
year={1998},
volume={3},

pages={1084-1092 vol.3},
abstract={Videoconferencing is an important global application -it enables people around the globe to interact when they are far from one another. In order for the participants in a video-conference call to interact naturally, the end-to-end delay should be below human perception-about 100 ms. Since the global propagation delay can be about 100 ms, the actual end-to-end delay budget available to the system designer (excluding propagation delay) can be no more than 10 ms. We identify the components of the end-to-end delay in various configurations with the objective of understanding how it can be kept below the desired 10 ms bound. We analyze these components going step-by-step through six system configurations obtained by combining three generic network architectures with two video encoding schemes. We study the transmission of raw video and variable bit rate (VBR) MPEG video encoding over (i) circuit switching, (ii) synchronous packet switching, and (iii) asynchronous packet switching. In addition, we show that constant bit rate (CBR) MPEG encoding delivers unacceptable delay, which is on the order of the group of pictures (GOP) time interval. This study shows that having a global common time reference, together with time-driven priority (TDP) and VBR MPEG video encoding, provides adequate end-to-end delay, which is (i) below 10 ms, (ii) independent of the network instant load, and (iii) independent of the connection rate. The resulting end-to-end delay (excluding propagation delay) can be smaller than the video frame period, which is better than what can be obtained with circuit switching.},

pages={1093-1102 vol.3},
abstract={Supporting compressed video efficiently on networks is a challenge because of its burstiness. Although a large number of applications using compressed video are rate adaptive, it is also important to preserve quality as much as possible. We propose a smoothing and rate adaptation algorithm, called SAVE, that the compressed video source uses in conjunction with explicit rate based control in the network. SAVE smoothes the demand from the source to the network, thus helping achieve good multiplexing gains. SAVE maintains the quality of the video and ensures that the delay at the source buffer does not exceed a bound. We examine the effectiveness of SAVE across 28 different traces (entertainment and teleconferencing videos) using different compression algorithms.},

title={Packet fair queueing algorithms for wireless networks with location-dependent errors},
year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1103-1111 vol.3},
abstract={While packet fair queueing (PFQ) algorithms provide both bounded delay and fairness in wired networks, they cannot be applied directly to wireless networks. The key difficulty is that in wireless networks sessions can experience location-dependent channel errors. This may lead to situations in which a session receives significantly less service than it is supposed to, while another receives more. This results in large discrepancies between the sessions' virtual times, making it difficult to provide both delay-guarantees and fairness simultaneously. Our contribution is twofold. First, we identify a set of properties, called channel-condition independent fair (CIF), that a packet fair queueing algorithm should have in a wireless environment: (1) delay and throughput guarantees for error-free sessions, (2) long term fairness for error sessions, (3) short term fairness for error-free sessions, and (4) graceful degradation for sessions that have received excess service. Second, we present a methodology for adapting PFQ algorithms for wireless networks and we apply this methodology to derive a novel algorithm based on start-time fair queueing, called channel-condition independent packet fair queueing (CIF-Q), that achieves all the above properties. To evaluate the algorithm we provide both theoretical analysis and simulation results.},

abstract={The minimum-delay self-clocked fair queueing (MD-SCFQ) algorithm that we present in this paper is the first algorithm that achieves the same delay bounds as the packet by packet version of generalized processor sharing (P-GPS), has fairness properties similar to P-GPS, and uses a system-potential function of 0(1) complexity. To prove that MD-SCFQ achieves the same delay bounds of P-GPS, we have shown that the fluid version of MD-SCFQ belongs to the class of rate proportional server (RPS) schedulers; thus, its packet-by-packet version inherits all the well-known single-node and multiple-node delay properties of P-RPS schedulers. We have also computed the fairness index of MD-SCFQ, and show that is very close to that of P-GPS. Because of the properties of its system potential, MD-SCFQ, when combined with a shaper which declares packets eligible for scheduling according to their virtual starting times, is a work-conserving worst-case fair scheduler.},

title={On adaptive bandwidth sharing with rate guarantees},
year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1122-1130 vol.3},
abstract={The objective of research in fair queueing schemes has been to efficiently emulate a fluid-flow generalized (weighted) processor sharing (GPS) system as closely as possible. A primary motivation for the use of fair queueing has been its use as a means of providing bandwidth guarantees and as a consequence end-to-end delay bounds for traffic with bounded burstiness. The rate guarantees translate to scheduling weights which are set when admission control is done. A consequence of fair queueing systems closely emulating GPS is that when one or more connections are not back-logged, any "excess" bandwidth is distributed to back-logged connections in proportion to their weights. However weights are set based on the long-term requirements of traffic flows and not in any state-dependent manner that reflects instantaneous needs. We question the notion that the queueing system should closely emulate a GPS system. Instead of emulating GPS, we propose three modified scheduling schemes which preserve the rate guarantees of fair queueing (and hence preserve deterministic delay bounds) but adaptively redistribute the excess bandwidth such that either losses are reduced or delays equalized. We compare the performance of the proposed schemes to that of fair queueing using different traffic sources such as voice and video, as well as sources which have aggregate long-range dependent behavior. We find that the proposed schemes, in comparison to packet GPS (PGPS), reduce packet losses and curtail the tails of delay distributions for real-time traffic and hence permit the use of significantly smaller playout buffers for the same network load.},

abstract={The feasible-region is a simple and optimal framework for scheduling the transmission of data with deadlines. We establish the fundamental relationship between the bandwidth requirement and the initial delay in feasible-region-based transmission scheduling. The relationship represents the optimal bandwidth/delay tradeoff. In the process, we identify the essential bandwidth, the exact bandwidth lower bound regardless of the initial delay. Efficient algorithms are given to calculate the essential bandwidth as well as the optimal bandwidth/delay tradeoff. The results extend the previous results on feasible-region-based scheduling, most of which were derived in the context of video traffic smoothing. When applied to the problem of scheduling scalable multimedia, we show that the feasible-region framework enables the integrated scheduling of presentation and transmission and is a new and promising approach of dealing with scalable multimedia. We establish the presentation feasibility condition and present some initial results on scheduling spatial scalability.},

We also investigated the problem of power control in such hybrid systems. In this paper, we continue our study and address the time scheduling issue of hybrid CDMA/TDMA. Using the generalized processor sharing technique, typically employed in TDMA systems, we develop a time scheduling scheme suitable for the class of hybrid CDMA/TDMA systems.

volume={3},
number={},
pages={1172-1179 vol.3},
abstract={Controlling the rate of bulk data multicast to a large number of receivers is difficult due to the heterogeneity among the end-systems' capabilities and their available network bandwidth. If the data transfer rate is too high, some receivers will lose data, and retransmissions will be required. If the data transfer rate is too low, an inordinate amount of time will be required to transfer the data. In this paper, we examine an approach towards rate-controlled multicast of bulk data in which the sender uses multiple multicast groups to transmit data at different rates to different sub-groups of receivers. We present simple algorithms for determining the transmission rate associated with each multicast channel, based on static resource constraints, e.g., network bandwidth bottlenecks. Transmission rates are chosen so as to minimize the average time needed to transfer data to all receivers. Analysis and simulation are used to show that our policies for rate selection perform well for large and diverse receiver groups and make efficient use of network bandwidth. Moreover, we find that only a small number of multicast groups are needed to reap most of the possible performance benefits.},

abstract={Retransmission based error control for large scale multicast applications is difficult because of implosion and exposure. Existing schemes (SRM, RMTP, TMTP LBRRM) have good solutions to implosion, but only approximate solutions to exposure. We present a scheme that achieves finer grain fault recovery by exploiting new forwarding services that allow us to create a dynamic hierarchy of receivers. We extend the IP multicast service model so that routers provide a more refined form of multicasting (which may be useful to other applications), that enables local recovery. The new services are simple to implement and do not require routers to examine or store application packets; hence, they do not violate layering. Besides providing better implosion control and less exposure than other schemes, our scheme integrates well with the current IP model, has small recovery latencies (it requires no back-off delays), and completely isolates group members from topology. Our scheme can be used with a variety of multicast routing protocols, including DVMRP and PIM. We have implemented our scheme in NetBSD Unix, using about 250 lines of new C-code. The implementation requires two new IP options, 4 additional bytes in each routing entry and a slight modification to IGMP reports. The forwarding overhead incurred by the new services is actually lower than forwarding normal multicast traffic.},

year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1205-1213 vol.3},
abstract={To efficiently transfer large amounts of diverse traffic over high-speed links, modern integrated networks require more efficient packet-switching techniques that can capitalize on advances in switch hardware. Several promising approaches attempt to improve performance by creating dedicated "shortcut" connections for long-lived traffic flows, at the expense of the network overhead for establishing and maintaining these shortcuts. The network can balance these cost-performance tradeoffs through three tunable parameters: the granularity of flow end-point addresses, the timeout for grouping related packets into flows, and the trigger for migrating a long-lived flow to a shortcut connection. Drawing on a continuous one-week trace of Internet traffic, we evaluate the processor and switch overheads for transferring HTTP server traffic through a flow-switched network. In contrast to previous work, we focus on the full probability distributions of flow sizes and cost-performance metrics to highlight the subtle influence of the HTTP protocol and user behavior on the performance of flow switching. We find that moderate levels of aggregation and triggering yield significant reductions in overhead with a negligible reduction in performance. The traffic characterization results further suggest schemes for limiting the shortcut setup rate and the number of simultaneous shortcuts by temporarily delaying the creation of shortcuts during peak load, and by aggregating related packets that share a portion of their routes through the network.},

abstract={The World Wide Web (WWW) has gained tremendously in popularity. In this work we explore the use of UDP, best-effort multicast as a delivery option. Reliability is achieved through repetitive, cyclic transmission of a requested page. This solution is expected to be most efficient when used for highly requested pages. We view this cyclic multicast technique as a delivery option that can be integrated with the traditional reliable unicast and reliable multicast options. We first describe the architecture of an integrated Web server employing all three delivery options. We then describe the cyclic multicast technique and consider the various procedures needed for its successful operation. We characterize the gains in performance achieved by our proposal through an extensive performance analysis and simulation of our technique by itself, and when integrated with the other delivery options. We also describe our experience with an implementation of a prototype cyclic multicast server and its performance over the multicast backbone (MBone).},

abstract={High-performance Web servers are essential to meet the growing demands of the Internet and large-scale intranets. Satisfying these demands requires a thorough understanding of key factors affecting Web server performance. This paper presents empirical analysis illustrating how dynamic and static adaptivity can enhance Web server performance. Two research contributions support this conclusion. First, the paper presents results from a comprehensive empirical study of Web servers (such as Apache, Netscape Enterprise, PHTTPD, Zeus, and JAWS) over high-speed ATM networks. This study illustrates their relative performance and precisely pinpoints the server design choices that cause performance bottlenecks. Once network and disk I/O overheads are reduced to negligible constant factors, the main determinants of Web server performance are its protocol processing path and concurrency strategy. Moreover no single strategy performs optimally for all load conditions and traffic types. Second, we describe the design techniques and optimizations used to develop JAWS, our high-performance adaptive Web server. JAWS is an object-oriented Web server that was explicitly designed to alleviate the performance bottlenecks we identified in existing Web servers. The performance optimizations used in JAWS include adaptive prespawned threading, fixed headers, cached date processing, and file caching. In addition, JAWS uses a novel software architecture that substantially improves its portability and flexibility, relative to other Web servers.},

volume={3},

pages={1232-1239 vol.3},
abstract={Prefetching has been shown to be an effective technique for reducing user perceived latency in distributed systems. In this paper we show that even when prefetching adds no extra traffic to the network, it can have serious negative performance effects. Straightforward approaches to prefetching increase the burstiness of individual sources, leading to increased average queue sizes in network switches. However, we also show that applications can avoid the undesirable queueing effects of prefetching. In fact, we show that applications employing prefetching can significantly improve network performance, to a level much better than that obtained without any prefetching at all. This is because prefetching offers increased opportunities for traffic shaping that are not available in the absence of prefetching. Using a simple transport rate control mechanism, a prefetching application can modify its behavior from a distinctly ON/OFF entity to one whose data transfer rate changes less abruptly, while still delivering all data in advance of the user's actual requests.},

title={Routing lookups in hardware at memory access speeds},

volume={3},

pages={1240-1247 vol.3},
abstract={The increased bandwidth in the Internet puts great demands on network routers; for example, to route minimum sized Gigabit Ethernet packets, an IP router must process about 1.5/spl times/10/sup 6/ packets per second per port. Using the "rule-of-thumb" that it takes roughly 1000 packets per second for every 10/sup 6/ bits per second of line rate, an OC-192 line requires 10/spl times/10/sup 6/ routing lookups per second; well above current router capabilities. One limitation of router performance is the route lookup mechanism. IP routing requires that a router perform a longest-prefix-match address lookup for each incoming datagram in order to determine the datagram's next hop. We present a route lookup mechanism that when implemented in a pipelined fashion in hardware, can achieve one route lookup every memory access. With current 50 ns DRAM, this corresponds to approximately 20/spl times/10/sup 6/ packets per second; much faster than current commercially available routing lookup schemes. We also present novel schemes for performing quick updates to the forwarding table in hardware. We demonstrate using real routing update patterns that the routing tables can be updated with negligible overhead to the central processor.},

abstract={IP address lookup is becoming critical because of increasing routing table size, speed, and traffic in the Internet. Our paper shows how binary search can be adapted for best matching prefix using two entries per prefix and by doing precomputation. Next we show how to improve the performance of any best matching prefix scheme using an initial array indexed by the first X bits of the address. We then describe how to take advantage of cache line size to do a multiway search with 6-way branching. Finally, we show how to extend the binary search solution and the multiway search solution for IPv6. For a database of N prefixes with address length W, naive binary search scheme would take O(W*logN); we show how to reduce this to O(W+logN) using multiple column binary search. Measurements using a practical (Mae-East) database of 30000 entries yield a worst case lookup time of 490 nanoseconds, five times faster than the Patricia trie scheme used in BSD UNIX. Our scheme is attractive for IPv6 because of small storage requirement (2N nodes) and speed (estimated worst case of 7 cache line reads).},

title={Informed-source coding-on-demand (ISCOD) over broadcast channels},
year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1257-1264 vol.3},
abstract={We present the informed source coding on-demand (ISCOD) approach for efficiently supplying non-identical data from a central server to multiple caching clients through a broadcast channel. The key idea underlying ISCOD is the joint exploitation of the data already cached by each client, the server's full awareness of client cache contents and client requests, and the fact that each client only needs to be able to derive the items requested by it rather than all the items ever transmitted or even the union of the items requested by the different clients. We present a set of two-phase ISCOD algorithms. The server uses these algorithms to assemble ad-hoc error correction sets based its knowledge of every client's cache content and of the items requested by it; next, it uses error-correction codes to construct the data that is actually transmitted. Each client uses its cached data and the received supplemental data to derive the items that it has requested. This technique achieves a reduction of up to tens of percents in the amount of data that must be transmitted in order for every client to be able to derive the data requested by it. Finally, we define k-partial cliques in a directed graph, and cast the two phase approach in terms of partial clique covers. As a byproduct of this work, bounds and a close approximation for the expected cardinality of the maximum matching in a random graph have been derived and are outlined.},

volume={3},

pages={1273-1283 vol.3},
abstract={We address the problem of estimating the spectrum required in a wireless network for a given demand and interference pattern. This problem can be abstracted as a generalization of the graph coloring problem, which typically presents additional degree of hardness compared to the standard coloring problem. It is worthwhile to note that the question of estimating the spectrum requirement differs markedly from that of allocating channels. The main focus of this work is to obtain strong upper and lower bounds on the spectrum requirement, as opposed to the study of spectrum allocation/management. While the relation to graph coloring establishes the intractability of the spectrum estimation problem for arbitrary network topologies, useful bounds and algorithms are obtainable for specific topologies. We establish some new results regarding generalized coloring, which we use to derive tight bounds for specific families of graphs. We also examine the hexagonal grid topology, a commonly used topology for wireless networks. We design efficient algorithms that exploit the geometric structure of the hexagonal grid topology to determine upper bounds on the spectrum requirement for arbitrary demand patterns. The slack in our upper bounds is estimated by analyzing subgraphs with specific properties. While we consider the worst-case demand patterns to evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we expect them to perform much better in practice.},

abstract={A cellular network is often modelled as a graph and the channel assignment problem is formulated as a coloring problem of the graph. We introduce the notion of cellular graphs that models the hexagonal cell structures of a cellular network. Exploiting the regular structure of the cellular graphs we compute the upper and the lower bounds for a class of channel assignment problems. Assuming a k-band buffering system where the interference does not extend beyond k cells away from the call originating cell, we provide two different formulations of the channel assignment problem-distance-k chromatic number problem and k-band chromatic bandwidth problem. We give one algorithm for the first problem and two for the second, with all three algorithms assigning channels to the cells. The complexity of the algorithm for the first problem is O(p), where p is the number of cells. For the second problem, the complexity of the first algorithm is O(p) and the complexity of the second algorithm is O(k/sup 5/log k). All the algorithms are asymptotically optimal, in the sense that the order of the upper bound of the number of channels required is the same as the order of the lower bound.},

abstract={The fast fading channel modeling traditionally focuses on physical-level dynamics such as signal strength and bit error rate. We characterize fast fading channel dynamics at the packet-level and analyze the corresponding data queueing performance in various environments. The integration of wireless channel modeling and data queueing analysis provides us a unique way to capture important channel statistics with respect to various wireless network factors such as channel bandwidth, mobile speed and channel coding. The second order channel statistics, i.e., channel power spectrum, is identified to play a dominant role in fast fading channel modeling. The data queueing performance is largely dependent on the interaction between the channel power spectrum and the data arrival power spectrum, whichever has a lower frequency power will have a dominant impact on the queueing performance. The data arrival power spectrum provides a measure of burstiness and correlation behavior of data packet arrivals. In queueing analysis, we use a Markov chain modeling technique to match the measured important channel statistics.},

title={Sizing exit buffers in ATM networks under CBR traffic},
year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1309-1316 vol.3},
abstract={This paper deals with the sizing of end buffers in ATM networks for sessions subject to constant bit rate (CBR) traffic. Our objective is to predict the cell loss rate at the end buffer as a function of the system parameters. We introduce the D+G/D/1 queue as a generic model to represent exit buffers in telecommunications networks under constant rate traffic and use it to model the end buffer. This is a queue whose arrival rate is equal to its service rate and whose arrivals are generated at regular intervals and materialize after generally distributed random amount of time. We reveal that under the infinite buffer assumption the system possesses rather intriguing properties. On the one hand it is unstable, so that the "steady state" contents of the buffer may exceed any value. On the other hand, in practice, the likelihood of the buffer exceeding even small values is very small. Improper simulation of such systems may therefore lead to false results. We analyze this system under finite buffer assumption and derive bounds on the cell loss rates. The bounds are expressed in terms of simple formulae of the system parameters. We carry out the analysis for two major types of networks: (1) datagram networks, where the packets (cells) traverse the network via independent paths, and (2) virtual circuit networks, where all cells of a connection traverse the same path. Numerical examination of ATM-like examples show that the bounds are very good for practical prediction of cell loss and the selection of buffer size.},

title={On the impact of long-range-dependent traffic in dimensioning ATM network buffer},
year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1317-1324 vol.3},
abstract={Recent measurements of packet networks have shown that packet traffic exhibits long-range-dependent property. Studies have also discovered that this property is not adequately captured by the conventional Markov traffic models and often yields queueing behavior such as heavy-tailed or subexponential queue length distribution. These findings have led to the implication that long-range-dependent traffic has a significant impact on determining queueing performance and dimensioning buffer requirement in general. This paper examines the impact of long-range-dependent traffic on providing connectionless services over ATM networks using AAL5 protocol. As connectionless data packets enter an ATM network, they are encapsulated into AAL5 frames. Within the ATM network, AAL5 frames are segmented into cells for transmission and reassembled at intermediate connectionless servers for frame switching. A queueing model characterizing the AAL5 frame reassembly operation is developed and analyzed to investigate the impact of long-range-dependent traffic on dimensioning the frame reassembly buffer. The buffer overflow probability is analytically derived. Tight upper bound and lower bound of the AAL5 frame loss probability are also established. The analysis shows that long-range-dependent traffic and conventional Markovian traffic yield similar queueing behavior in the frame reassembly operation.},

year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1325-1332 vol.3},
abstract={Constant bit rate (CBR) traffic is expected to be a major source of traffic in high-speed networks. Such sources may have stringent delay and loss requirements and in many cases, they should be delivered exactly as they were generated. A simple delay priority scheme will bound the cell delay and jitter for CBR streams, so that in the network switches, CBR traffic will only compete with other CBR traffic in the networks. We consider a multiplexor in such an environment. We provide an exact analysis of the jitter process in the homogeneous case. In this case, we obtain the complete characterization of the jitter process showing the inaccuracies of the existing results. Our results indicate that the jitter variance is bounded and never exceeds the constant /sup 2///sub 3/ slot. It is also shown that the per-stream successive cell inter-departures times are negatively correlated with the lag 1 correlation of - 1/2 . Higher order correlation coefficients are shown to be zero. Simple asymptotic results on per-stream behavior are also provided when the number of CBR streams is considered large. In the heterogeneous case, we bound the jitter distribution and moments. Simple results are provided for the computation of the bound on the jitter variance for any mix of CBR streams in this case. It is shown that streams with a low rate (large period) do experience little jitter variance. However, the jitter variance for the high-rate streams could be quite substantial.},

abstract={B-ISDN is conceived to support all types of existing and new emerging applications. In the context of B-ISDN and the new age of information, the user terminal will generate data, voice, video and, in general, multimedia traffic. ATM is the selected mechanism for the efficient transfer of these information across the future worldwide network. The proper design of this network requires cost-effective solutions that may satisfy the quality of service constraints of all the connections. To achieve this goal, an accurate characterization of the traffic generated by the sources is needed. This characterization should capture the statistical properties of the ATM traffic that are relevant to network performance. A review of literature shows that, from a general point of view, this objective has been reached, but with two drawbacks: traffic models are application dependant and, moreover, for some applications, traffic models are not analytically tractable. The final objective of this paper is to construct a general analytical B-ISDN model. Particularly, the paper focuses on the on-off models with general distributions, for which a complete exact statistical characterization at cell level was already obtained in a previous paper. On the basis of this characterization, an algorithm devoted to capture the statistical behaviour of any source is formulated and developed. Particularly, the algorithm captures the average rate and burstiness of any source in an exact way, and the autocorrelation function in an optimal way. Finally, numerical results for different types of video sources are provided.},

abstract={In ATM networks, the available bit rate (ABR) service enables data sources to efficiently utilize network resources without adversely affecting the performance of non-ABR, guaranteed traffic such as video.

Unrealistic assumptions such as persistent data sources, an absence of non-ABR traffic, and inaccurate TCP models may lead to misleading results. We address the above shortcomings of previous research. In a comparison of two major ABR schemes, the rate based Explicit Rate Indication for Congestion Avoidance (ERICA) and the credit based Quantum Flow Control (QFC), we find that the performance may be significantly better with QFC than previously thought when bursty traffic sources and bursty interfering traffic is considered.},

abstract={Max-min is a frequently praised criterion for flow control despite its limitations. In practice, the fast rate of changes in the connection layout in modern networks makes it hard for any flow control algorithm to converge to an optimal point. In such an environment, it might be better to trade accuracy with speed. We present algorithms that relax the optimality criterion of the max-min flow fairness but achieve a fast convergence time that is logarithmic in the link bandwidth and not a function of the number of active connections (or sessions). The relaxation we use requires rates to be increased or decreased by a certain factor, 1+/spl epsiv/, or in other words, assigned rates can only be a natural power of some basic bandwidth 1+/spl epsiv/. Under this criterion, the quiescent time of our flow control algorithms is log/sub 1+/spl epsiv//B, where B is the maximum link bandwidth in minimum allocation units. This is a great improvement over the super-linear quiescent time of known algorithms both exact and approximated.},

year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1358-1365 vol.3},
abstract={The available bit rate (ABR) sessions in an ATM network share the bandwidth left over after guaranteeing service to constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR) traffic. Hence the bandwidth available to ABR sessions is randomly varying. This bandwidth must be shared by the sessions in a max-min fair fashion. Our point of departure in this paper is to formulate the problem of determining the max-min fair session rates as the problem of finding the root of a certain nonlinear vector equation; the same formulation also arises with our notion of max-min fairness with positive minimum cell rates (MCRs). This formulation allows us to use a stochastic approximation algorithm for online distributed computation of the max-min fair rates. We use the well known ordinary differential equation technique to prove convergence of the algorithm in the synchronous update case. We provide simulation results using the NIST simulator to show that the algorithm is able to track the max-min fair rates for slowly varying random available link bandwidths.},

Except for physical and MAC layer overheads, the scheme exhibits comparable behaviour to that of an ideal multiplexer, for traces with very diverse correlation structures.

pages={1392-1399 vol.3},
abstract={Cable plants were initially designed for one-way broadcast of analog television signals (from the head-end to the neighborhood). They are now being upgraded to provide an upstream path (from the home to the head-end). New challenges arise in using the upstream channel since the available bandwidth is low and the noise levels are high. Different variations of the reservation Aloha protocol have been proposed as the MAC protocol to efficiently share the scarce upstream capacity. The efficiency of the reservation protocol highly depends on the capacity assigned to the reservation channel. In this paper we present a control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the operating parameters to the current load on the system. The control mechanism does not require any framing structure and is built around a "sea of mini-slots". The performance under both static and highly dynamic loads is close to optimum. The station implementation remains particularly simple and the downstream control structure is also simple. Results are given here for fixed length data units (ATM cells) but the algorithm extends very simply to variable length MAC frames.},

abstract={In order to provide quality of service (QoS) to users with real-time data such as voice, video and interactive services, the evolving IEEE 802.14 standard for hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) networks must include an effective priority scheme. In this paper we investigate the ability of the current IEEE 802.14 specification to provide priority service and show that a preemptive scheduler is not a sufficient solution. We propose to augment the scheduler with a novel scheme for implementing priority access in an HFC random access environment. The proposed mechanism integrates a multilevel priority collision resolution system into the proposed IEEE 802.14 MAC. The scheme separates and resolves collisions between stations in a priority order. A set of simulation scenarios is presented that shows the robustness and efficiency of the protocol, such as its ability to isolate higher priorities from lower ones and provide quick access to high priority requests.},

abstract={A new distributed algorithm for the dynamic computation of multiple loop-free paths from source to destination in a computer network or Internet are presented, validated, and analyzed. According to this algorithm, which is called DASM (diffusing algorithm for shortest multipath), each router maintains a set of entries for each destination in its routing table, and each such entry consists of a set of tuples specifying the next router and distance in a loop-free path to the destination. DASM guarantees instantaneous loop freedom of multipath routing tables by means of a generalization of Dijkstra and Scholten's diffusing computations. With generalized diffusing computations, a node in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) defined for a given destination has multiple next nodes in the DAG and is able to modify the DAG without creating a directed loop. DASM is shown to be loop-free at every instant, and its average performance is analyzed by simulation and compared against an ideal link-state algorithm and the diffusing update algorithm (DUAL).},

pages={1426-1432 vol.3},
abstract={In this paper, the dynamic multicast routing problem is studied. The multicast routing problem has been shown to be NP-complete. Many heuristics have been proposed to find the multicast trees for multicast connections. In computer networks, application services may allow nodes to join or leave the multicast connection dynamically. The multicast routing problem in which nodes are allowed to join or leave the multicast connection is called the dynamic multicast routing problem. A new dynamic multicast routing algorithm called virtual trunk dynamic multicast (VTDM) routing algorithm is proposed for this problem. A virtual trunk (VT) is a tree of the underlying graph. It is used as a template for constructing multicast trees. The VTDM routing algorithm constructs multicast trees based on the virtual trunk. Simulations are performed to study the performance of the VTDM routing algorithm. Simulation results show that the performance of the VTDM algorithm is close to that of the KMB algorithm (a near optimal heuristic for the static multicast routing problem).},

year={1998},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1433-1440 vol.3},
abstract={We propose an algorithm for finding a multicast tree in packet-switched networks. The objective is to minimize total cost incurred at the multicast path. The routing model is based on the minimum cost Steiner tree problem. The Steiner problem is extended to incorporate two additional requirements. First, the delay experienced along the path from the source to each destination is bounded. Second, the destinations are allowed to join and leave multicasting anytime during a session. To minimize the disruption to on-going multicasting the algorithm adopts the idea of connecting a new destination to the current multicasting by a minimum cost path satisfying the delay bound. To find such a path is an NP-hard problem and an enumerative method relying on generation of delay bounded paths between node pairs is not likely to find a good routing path in acceptable computation time when network size is large. To cope with such difficulty, the proposed algorithm utilizes an optimization technique called Lagrangian relaxation method. A computational experiment is done on relatively dense and large Waxman's networks. The results seem to be promising. For sparse networks, the algorithm can find near-optimal multicast trees. Also the quality of multicast trees does not seem to deteriorate even when the network size grows. Furthermore, the experimental results shows that the computational efforts for each addition of node to the call are fairly moderate, namely the same as to solve a few shortest path problems.},

Our results indicate that the M/G//spl infin/ model is much more accurate in predicting the actual queueing performance than the F-ARIMA model.

abstract={We consider a switching system which has multiple ports that share a common buffer, in which there is a FIFO logical queue for each port. Each port may support a large number of flows or connections, which are approximately homogeneous in their statistical characteristics, with common QoS requirements in cell loss and maximum delay. Heterogeneity may exist across ports. Our first contribution is a buffer management scheme based on buffer admission control, which is integrated with connection admission control at the switch, and is at the same time fair, efficient and robust in sharing the buffer resources across ports. Our scheme is based on the resource-sharing technique of virtual partitioning. Our second major contribution is to advance the practice of discrete-event fluid simulations. Such simulations are approximations to cell-level simulations and offer orders of magnitude speed-up. A third contribution of the paper is the formulation and solution of a problem of optimal allocation of bandwidth and buffers to each port having specific delay bounds, in a lossless multiplexing framework. Finally, we report on extensive simulation results. The scheme is found to be effective, efficient and robust.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider a nonblocking ATM switch with capacity C which adopts a hybrid priority control scheme in input buffers. Each input queue has two separate buffer spaces with different sizes for two classes of traffic, and adopts a general state-dependent scheduling scheme which assigns priorities to each class dynamically. We obtain the distribution of input queue length, loss probabilities and mean waiting times of two traffic classes using a semi-Markov process concept and compare the performances of various scheduling schemes. Numerical analysis and simulation indicate that the utilization of the switch with the hybrid priority control scheme satisfying the QoS of each traffic class is much higher than that of the switch without control. And, the required buffer size is reduced while satisfying the same QoS. Among the 5 scheduling schemes we have considered in this paper, the queue length threshold (QLT) scheme yields the highest utilization of the switch and has flexible performance which is adequate to satisfy, various values of QoS for two classes of traffics.},

abstract={Authenticated session key establishment is a central issue in network security. This paper addresses the question of whether we can design a compact, efficient and authenticated key establishment protocol that has the following two properties: (1) each message exchanged between two participants can be transferred in a short packet such as an ATM cell whose payload has only 384 bits, and (2) messages that carry key materials are unforgeable and nonrepudiatable without the involvement of a trusted key distribution center. We discuss why the answer to this question is negative if one follows the currently standard approach to key establishment, namely employing secret/public key encryption and, possibly, digital signature.

abstract={We present the design of a distributed authorization service which parallels existing authentication services for distributed systems. Such a service would operate on top of an authentication substrate. There are two distinct ideas underlying our design: (1) the use of a language, called generalized access control list (GACL), as a common representation of authorization requirements; and (2) the use of authenticated delegation to effect authorization offloading from an end server to an authorization server. We present the syntax and semantics of GACL, and illustrate how it can be used to specify authorization requirements that cannot be easily specified by ordinary ACL. We also describe the protocols in our design.},

year={1998},

pages={430-438 vol.2},
abstract={CMIS/P is the OSI system management service and protocol, used as the base technology for the telecommunication management network. It is a generic object-oriented protocol that provides multiple object access capabilities to managed object clusters administered by agent applications. Its navigation and object selection capabilities rely on traversing containment relationships. This is restrictive as information models for emerging broadband technologies (SDH/SONET, ATM) exhibit various other relationships. We present extensions to the CMIS service that provide a richer access language and show how these extensions can be supported by corresponding extensions to the CMIP protocol. These extensions allow one to traverse any object relationship and to filter out objects at any stage of the selection process. CMIS++ provides much greater expressive power than CMIS while CMIP++ supports the remote evaluation of the corresponding expressions, minimizing the management traffic required for complex management information retrieval. These extensions follow an incremental approach, starting from a version compatible with the current standard and adding gradually sophisticated features. The applicability and importance of the proposed concepts is demonstrated through an example from SDH management while we also discuss implementation considerations.},

pages={439-446 vol.2},
abstract={The complexity of modern networks calls for decentralized control schemes where each user makes its control decisions independently based on some individual performance objectives. The operating points of such noncooperative networks are the Nash equilibria of the underlying control game. Nash equilibria are generically inefficient and lead to suboptimal network performance. Using routing as a control paradigm, a methodology is devised for overcoming this inefficiency based on pricing mechanisms. Assuming that the price for usage of each link's proportional to the congestion level at the link, is shown that the provider can enforce any operating point it deems efficient by offering the capacity of the various links at discount prices. The incentive compatible discount vector is shown to be unique to the extent of a multiplicative constant, and its structure is specified explicitly. An adaptive algorithm for distributed computation of the incentive compatible discount vector is introduced. The applicability of the results in various practical scenarios is investigated by means of a prototype that implements the routing game as a Web-based game.},

pages={455-462 vol.2},
abstract={The challenge is to develop an easily usable protocol development framework that combines the flexibility of layered implementations, the efficiency of tightly-coupled monolithic implementations and the correctness achievable using high-level protocol validation languages. This challenge is addressed by a language-based framework that introduces a new protocol specification language called Promela++. The framework consists of a protocol verification tool and an optimizing compiler that generates efficient protocol code from Promela++ specifications. Promela++ is based on the Promela protocol validation language and has been designed with a rich set of domain-specific constructs. These constructs facilitate the task of protocol specification as well as enable the Promela++ compiler to perform domain-specific optimizations. The Promela++ compiler can also automatically transform protocol specifications in Promela++ to protocol models in Promela. The article presents a new language that unites the twin goals of checking protocol correctness using model checkers, and efficient protocol construction using optimizing compilers, under a single framework; exploits language design to provide mechanisms that simultaneously ease programming and enable generation of efficient protocol code; and demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach by doing a complete evaluation of multiple protocol implementations in Promela++.},

abstract={Compared to kernel-level servers, user-level ones can be debugged and maintained more easily and safely, but traditionally have had much worse performance. We describe a novel I/O-oriented inter-proces communication (IPC) facility that combines the emulated copy data passing scheme for monolithic systems with new copy avoidance techniques for microkernel systems. Unlike previous optimizations, I/O-oriented IPC does not require changes in existing user applications or complex restructuring of servers; it offers an API with copy semantics and allows the same servers to be installed at kernel or user level. In end-to-end experiments on an ATM network at 512 Mbps, I/O-oriented IPC gave user-level protocol servers performance approaching that of kernel-level ones. Performance differences scaled roughly inversely to the processor's SPECint95 rating, projecting fast further improvement.},

pages={472-479 vol.2},
abstract={The introduction of the concept of QoS has led to an extension of the traditional concepts of service and service specification. However, the design of QoS support is usually done without a systematic approach, leading to concepts of QoS support ranging from basic QoS monitoring capabilities to hard real-time guarantees. In more advanced QoS support, intermediate layers should be designed in a way that enables the masking or controlled handling of sporadic QoS violations. To implement this degradation path support across multiple layers, a negotiation of preferred and supportable failure semantics is a requirement. To realize these advanced QoS support features, not only new QoS control mechanisms within the layers have to be developed but the semantics of QoS negotiation protocols between layers must be better understood and subsequently extended. A framework formally based on set theory and relations is presented that allows the specification of QoS hierarchies including a well-defined failure type model. The framework supports the development of QoS negotiation protocols and can be used as a formal base for a structured system analysis.},

abstract={Much of the work on distributed virtual environments (DVEs) has focused on efficient schemes and algorithms for the description and visual rendering of such environments. However, there has been comparatively little effort on senses other than sight, and in particular on live voice. This is surprising because adding voice to DVEs enhances the sense of immersion in the environment, and can in fact completely change the way entities interact. For example, adding voice in a distributed game impacts tactics, team building, cheating, etc. We examine issues related to adding voice between participants in DVEs. We consider in particular a special kind of DVE, namely distributed games over the Internet. We consider all stages of voice manipulation, including voice generation (with emphasis on echo cancellation), voice transmission (with emphasis on RTP and packetization), and voice restitution (with emphasis on spatial rendition and on synchronization between voice and visual cues). We also consider implementation issues, and illustrate these with the MiMaze game and the FreePhone audio tool, both developed at INRIA.},

abstract={Although the Internet was designed to handle non-real time data traffic, it is being used increasingly to carry voice and video. One important class of contributors to this growth are Internet telephones. Critical to more widespread use of Internet telephony is smooth interoperability with the existing telephone network. This interoperability comes through the use of Internet telephony gateways (ITGs) which perform protocol translation between an IP network and the public switched telephone network (PSTN). In order for an IP host to call a user on the PSTN, the IP host must know the IP address of an appropriate gateway. We consider the problem of finding these gateways. An analysis of a number of protocol architectures is presented, including hierarchical databases, multicast advertisement, routing protocols, and centralized databases. We propose a new protocol architecture, called Brokered Multicast Advertisements (BMA) which serves as a lightweight, scalable mechanism for locating ITGs. The BMA architecture is general, and can be applied to location of any service across a wide area network.},

We discuss in detail our analytical methods and the robustness of empirical estimators of H under conditions of non-negligible packet loss. Our results indicate that Internet delay is bursty across multiple time scales, which implies that end-user duality of service in the Internet is likely to be impacted by long periods of very large and/or highly variable delays.},

title={Simulation of FEC-based error control for packet audio on the Internet},
year={1998},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={505-515 vol.2},
abstract={Real-time audio over a best-effort network, such as the Internet, frequently suffers from packet loss. To mitigate the impact of such packet loss, several research efforts and implementation studies advocate the use of forward error correction (FEC) coding. Although these prior works have pioneered promising and novel applications of FEC to Internet audio, they do not definitively demonstrate the advantages of FEC because they do not evaluate aggregate performance that results from multiplexing many like flows. We build on previous landmark works with a systematic study of FEC for packet audio that characterizes the aggregate performance across all audio sources in the network. We refine the novel but ad hoc coding techniques proposed by Hardman, Sasse, Handley and Watson (see Proc. INET, 1995) into a formal framework that we call "signal processing-based FEC" (SFEC) and use our framework to more rigorously evaluate the relative merits of this approach. Through extensive simulation, we evaluate the "scalability" of SFEC for packet audio-i.e., the ability for a coding algorithm to improve aggregate performance when used by all sources in the network-and find that optimal signal quality is achieved when sources react to network congestion not by blindly adding FEC, but rather by adding FEC in a controlled fashion that simultaneously constrains the source-coding rate. As a result, packet loss is mitigated without introducing more congestion, thus admitting a more scalable and effective approach than successively adding redundancy to a constant bit-rate source. While this result may seem intuitive, it has not been previously suggested in the context of Internet audio, and until now, has not been systematically studied.},

abstract={The research on guaranteeing quality of services has been to a large extent focusing on satisfying cell-level performance such as cell loss rate, cell delay variation, etc. In the authors' previous work, they have used stochastic modeling techniques to evaluate the packet-level performance of two existing packet discarding schemes, packet tail discarding and early packet discarding, based on three packet-level performance measures: packet success probability, goodput, and badput. The work focused on the performance evaluation of data packet transmission over ATM unspecified bit rate (UBR) service. With the introduction of available bit rate (ABR) service, source regulation based on closed-loop control becomes increasingly important. In this work we analyze the performance of early packet discarding when the source transmission rates are governed by the feedback information from a congested ATM bottleneck node. Numerical study shows that the steady-state performance are largely affected by slow time scales of the feedback system. Nonetheless, the design of control threshold in early packet discarding is not significantly sensitive to the system time scales.},

TARC can be used alone or in conjunction with a window flow control mechanism. It can provide support for QoS guarantees, and can take advantage of lower layer congestion control or bandwidth under-utilization information. We analyze our model under multiple transport connections with bursty traffic and present an iterative method for computing the system state distributions and performance measures. Using this iterative analysis, we explore the behavior of TARC and compare its performance to other transport layer flow control algorithms.},

pages={556-563 vol.2},
abstract={We consider a time-slotted DS-CDMA network consisting of a single radio access point and a finite number of mobile wireless terminals. The terminals generate non-real-time packet data and transmit, subject to constraints on the average energy consumed per packet transmission, in a random access fashion over a common broadband channel to the access point using different spreading codes. As in narrowband ALOHA systems, the performance of random access spread spectrum networks can be severely hampered due to saturation effects caused by inherent bistable behavior. We study the effect of dynamic spreading gain control on the stability and throughput properties of the network. We first impose no energy constraints and provide an optimal (throughput maximizing) algorithm under which (i) the asymptotically optimal retransmission probability is equal to one, and (ii) the optimal spreading gain increases linearly as the multiaccess interference (MAI) level increases, or equivalently, the transmission rate decreases inverse linearly as the MAI level increases. We also obtain a simple closed-form expression for the asymptotic throughput as the number of backlogged terminals becomes large.

The resulting algorithm may or may not eliminate bistability; however, in either case, it achieves high throughput.},

title={Adaptive frame length control for improving wireless link throughput, range, and energy efficiency},
year={1998},
volume={2},

pages={564-571 vol.2},
abstract={Wireless network links are characterized by rapidly time varying channel conditions and battery energy limitations at the wireless mobile user nodes. Therefore static link control techniques that make sense in comparatively well behaved wired links do not necessarily apply to wireless links. New adaptive link layer control techniques are needed to provide robust and energy efficient operation even in the presence of orders of magnitude variations in bit error rates and other radio channel conditions. For example, research has advocated adaptive link layer techniques such as adaptive error control, channel state dependent protocols, and variable spreading gain. We explore dynamic sizing of the MAC layer frame, the atomic unit that is sent through the radio channel. A trade-off exists between the desire to reduce the header and physical layer overhead by making frames large, and the need to reduce frame error rates in the noisy channel by using small frame lengths. Clearly the optimum depends on the channel conditions. Through analysis supported by physical measurements with Lucent's WaveLAN radio we show that adaptive sizing of the MAC layer frame in the presence of varying channel noise indeed has a large impact on the user seen throughput (goodput). In addition, we show how that adaptive frame length control can be exploited to improve the energy efficiency for a desired level of goodput, and to extend the usable radio range with graceful throughput degradation. We describe the implementation of the adaptive MAC frame length control mechanism in combination with adaptive hybrid FEC/ARQ error control in a reconfigurable wireless link layer packet processing architecture for a low-power adaptive wireless multimedia node.},

year={1998},

pages={572-580 vol.2},
abstract={A key problem in transporting multimedia traffic across wireless networks is a controlled sharing of the wireless link by different packet streams. So far this problem has been treated as that of providing support for quality of service in time division multiplexing based medium access control protocols (MAC). Adopting a different perspective to the problem, this paper describes an approach based on extending the class-based queueing (CBQ) based controlled hierarchical link sharing model proposed for the Internet. Our scheme enhances CBQ, which works well in wired links such as point-to-point wires of fixed bandwidth, to also work well with wireless links based on radio channels that are (i) inherently shared on-demand among multiple radios, and (ii) are subject to highly dynamic bandwidth variations due to spatially and temporally varying fading with accompanying burst errors. The proposed scheme is based on combining a modified version of CBQ with channel-state dependent packet scheduling.},

pages={581-589 vol.2},
abstract={This paper presents a novel loss recovery scheme, active reliable multicast (ARM), for large scale reliable multicast. ARM is "active" in that routers in the multicast tree play an active role in loss recovery. Additionally, ARM utilizes soft-state storage within the network to improve performance and scalability. In the upstream direction, routers suppress duplicate NACKs from multiple receivers to control the implosion problem. By suppressing duplicate NACKs, ARM also lessens the traffic that propagates back through the network, In the downstream direction, routers limit the delivery of repair packets to receivers experiencing loss, thereby reducing network bandwidth consumption. Finally, to reduce wide-area recovery latency and to distribute the retransmission load, routers cache multicast data on a "best effort" basis. ARM is flexible and robust in that it does not require all nodes to be active, nor does it require any specific router or receiver to perform loss recovery. Analysis and simulation results show that ARM yields significant benefits even when less than half the routers within the multicast tree can perform ARM processing.},

abstract={A substantial fraction of all network traffic today comes from applications in which clients retrieve objects from servers. The caching of objects in locations "close" to clients is an important technique for reducing both network traffic and response time for such applications. In this paper we consider the benefits of associating caches with switching nodes throughout the network, rather than in a few locations. We also consider the use of various self-organizing or active cache management strategies for organizing cache content. We evaluate caching techniques using both simulation and a general analytic model for network caching. Our results indicate that in-network caching can make effective use of cache space, and in many cases self-organizing caching schemes yield better average round-trip latencies than traditional approaches, using much smaller per-node caches.},

abstract={Active networking allows the network infrastructure to be programmable. Previous research focused on two commonly separated approaches: "capsules" and "programmable switches". Capsules are typically small programs in packets which flow through the network and are executed in-band on nodes receiving them. Programmable switches are network devices which offer a back-door to inject code by a network administrator out-of-band in order to enhance the device's capabilities. By combining these two approaches, this paper proposes a novel system architecture which allows both application specific data processing in network nodes as well as rapid deployment of new network protocol implementations. Instead of carrying code, data packets carry pointers to digitally signed active modules initially loaded on-the-fly, inband from trusted code servers on the network. Packet processing runs at high speed, may access and modify the whole network subsystem and no potentially slow virtual machines are needed.},

volume={2},
number={},
pages={617-624 vol.2},
abstract={Modern communication networks evolve towards integration of guaranteed-performance and best-effort service types. The co-existence of these two service types offers substantial benefits, such as resource sharing between service classes, and the ability of the user to select an appropriate service class according to its individual requirements and preferences. Notwithstanding, such interaction potentially complicates the system behavior, and gives rise to subtle optimization questions, which need to be explored and understood in order to allow efficient network operation. In this paper we address some essential performance and flow control issues associated with such service interactions. We propose a fluid model for session flow, which captures the two interaction mechanisms of resource sharing. In particular, our model incorporates the possibility of session migration, where sessions may shift from best effort to guaranteed performance service due to congestion experienced in the former. Within this model, we analyze the system performance and characterize its steady state behavior. We further show that under certain conditions the system exhibits bistable behavior, where some transient congestion may stir the system from a stable and efficient operating point to an inefficient and congested one, which might persist indefinitely. For the latter case, we propose a call admission control scheme which prevents the system from getting trapped in a congested-type equilibrium, while not interfering with normal system operation.},

abstract={Proposals for the provision of deterministic quality of service guarantees in integrated services networks require per-session management of traffic flowing in network switches, raising scalability questions for practical implementation of high speed packet switching in large scale networks. At the same time, the end-to-end delay bounds associated with current proposals can be overly conservative, limiting the utility of the bounds to guide efficient resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce SCED+ (surface curve earliest deadline+), a network scheduling algorithm that yields scalable provision of tight deterministic end-to-end delay bounds. These features are achieved through the use of aggregation and efficient statistical multiplexing between best-effort and guaranteed traffic. The SCEDS+ algorithm also supports statistical multiplexing between "guaranteed" traffic streams, providing tight end-to-end delay bounds for traffic streams which can tolerate non-zero packet loss rates. In order to facilitate the analysis of SCED+, we refine the so-called "network calculus" to address delay jitter, and introduce a simple and unified approach to the analysis of output burstiness of traffic departing from a general network element.},

abstract={Providing statistical quality-of-service guarantees introduces conflicting requirements for both deterministic traffic models to isolate and police users and statistical multiplexing to efficiently utilize and share network resources. We address this issue by introducing two schemes for providing statistical services to deterministically policed sources: (1) adversarial mode resource allocation in which we bound the stochastic envelopes of policed streams and provide a statistical service for adversarial or worst case sources and (2) non-adversarial mode allocation in which we approximate the stochastic envelopes of policed, but non-worst-case streams in order to exploit a further statistical multiplexing gain in the typical case. Our key technique is to study the problem within the domain of deterministic and stochastic traffic envelopes, which allows us to explicitly consider sources with rate variations over multiple time scales, obtain results for any deterministic traffic model, and apply accurate admission control tests for buffered priority schedulers. We evaluate the scheme's performance with experiments using traces of compressed video and show that substantial statistical multiplexing gains are achieved.},

In this paper we consider the impact that statistically multiplexing heterogeneous services on VP connections will have on network design and management. Based on simple models we consider several questions including the following: given two traffic types with different quality of service requirements, should one segregate such flows on their own VPs, or is it to the network's advantage to multiplex the flows on a single VP guaranteeing the most stringent QoS requirement? Assuming two VPs have been set up between a given origin-destination pair and heterogeneous flows are to be carried, how should one route the connections to achieve good performance?.},

abstract={Advances in telecommunications have enabled the deployment of broadcast-based wide-area information services that provide on-demand data access to very large client populations. In order to effectively utilize a broadcast medium for such a service, it is necessary to have efficient, on-line scheduling algorithms that can balance individual and overall performance and can scale in terms of data set sizes, client populations, and broadcast bandwidth. In this study we introduce a parameterized algorithm that provides good performance across all of these criteria and can be tuned to emphasize either average or worst case waiting time. Unlike previous work on low overhead scheduling, the algorithm is not based on estimates of the access probabilities of items, but rather, it makes scheduling decisions based on the current queue state, allowing it to easily adapt to changes in the intensity and distribution of the workload. We examine the performance of the algorithm using a simulation model.},

abstract={Video smoothing is a promising technique for reducing the bandwidth variability of video in order to improve network efficiency. This paper presents a general optimal video smoothing algorithm based on the concept of dynamic programming. The algorithm generates the optimum transmission schedule for different requirements by setting the constraints and the cost function accordingly. It can be used to study the smoothing of both stored video and real time video. In particular, for stored video, we show how the number of rate changes in the smoothed video is affected by the renegotiation cost and buffer size, assuming that the transmission rate is allowed to be lower than the reserved rate. For the real time system, we study the impact of various system parameters, including playout delay, client buffer site, and server buffer size, on the performance of video smoothing.},

Such implied costs reflect the congestion in the cloud as well as the interdependencies among traffic streams in the network. We prove that both a synchronous and asynchronous distributed computation of the implied costs will converge to a unique solution under a light load condition. To assess accuracy, we derive a bound on the difference between our implied costs and those calculated for a flat network.

title={Minimizing the wireless cost of tracking mobile users: an adaptive threshold scheme},
year={1998},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={720-727 vol.2},
abstract={Mobile user tracking is a major issue in wireless networks. Previous studies and traditional approaches dealt only with tracking algorithms which adapt themselves to the user activity. We propose a novel approach for user tracking, in which the tracking activity is adapted to both user and system activity. The basic idea is to make the user location update rate dependent not only on the user activity (such as the call profile and mobility pattern); rather, it is made dependent also on the signaling load, which reflects the actual cost of the update operation. Thus, in low signaling load locations, the users are to transmit location update messages more frequently. To carry out this approach we propose an adaptive threshold scheme (ATS). The network determines for each cell a registration threshold level (which depends on the cell load) and announces it, as a broadcast message, to the users. A user computes its own registration priority and then transmits a registration message only if its priority exceeds the announced threshold level. Thus, whenever the local load on the cell is low, the users are requested to update their locations more often, while in loaded cells the registration activity is minimised. Our analysis shows that the adaptive threshold scheme reduces the paging cost, in comparison with other dynamic methods, without increasing the wireless cost of registration.},

abstract={Increasing demand for wireless mobile communications, coupled with limited network resources, has motivated investigation into alternative efficient mobility management solutions. We consider wireless PCS call setup protocols. We propose a lightweight location lookup protocol, which significantly reduces the network signaling and setup delay during call setup. As an alternative, we consider a reverse connection setup protocol that also performs efficient call setup, while minimizing the cost of failed call attempts. The two protocols have different advantages, in particular when combined with location management techniques including HLR/VLR, HLR/VLR with partial replication, and HLR/VLR with caching. We study the combinations of call setup protocols with location management techniques and compare their performance to find the most efficient call setup schemes.

abstract={Wireless two-way messaging is a new wireless data service that is rapidly gaining popularity. The basic service it provides is acknowledged exchange of short messages among subscribers or network-based servers. Like cellular/PCS systems, wireless two-way messaging systems are cellular in structure, and thus share the location management problem. We study the problem of location management for wireless two-way messaging. We first highlight the unique concerns of location management for wireless two-way messaging, and lay out its differences from cellular/PCS telephony. We then provide a new cost formulation for its study. Based on this formulation, we revisit existing schemes that have been proposed for cellular/PCS telephony to evaluate how they perform under wireless two-way messaging. We then introduce new classes of algorithms, called pending replies and deferred delivery, whose designs take advantage of the unique characteristics of wireless two-way messaging, and show through simulation, that they provide improved performance.},

year={1998},
volume={2},

pages={748-755 vol.2},
abstract={The initial cost to provide personal communications services (PCS) based on the conventional networks is relative high. As the radio cells move toward smaller size, the traditional procedures for call setup and control are not suitable well due to the high handoff frequency. The cable TV (CATV) network is one of the most attractive backbones for PCS due to its prevalent and broadcast nature. This significantly reduces the implementation costs and the handoff overheads. This paper proposes two architectures for the CATV-based PCS system. In the first architecture, each base station is equipped with multiple fixed receivers to provide fast and seamless handoffs for mobile terminals. Nevertheless, it suffers from the expensive hardware cost. In the second architecture, each base station is only equipped with one tunable receiver. This simple and economic architecture suffers from the possibility of offset conflict when mobile terminals handoff between the cells. Three channel allocation algorithms are proposed to resolve the offset conflict problem. Simulation results indicate the one with the concept of clustering performs much better than the other two schemes in terms of offset conflict probability.},

abstract={As the number and variety of Web- and network-based applications continues to increase, so does the need for flexible communication protocols and services to support them. Traditionally, a major impediment to deployment of new protocols is the need to upgrade millions of end-systems with compatible implementations. At the same time, Java-a language explicitly designed to support development and distribution of new applications via the Web-is emerging as a (potentially) ubiquitous system platform. It is therefore natural to consider whether Java might speed the introduction of protocols to better support new applications. We investigate the tradeoffs involved in using Java for protocol implementation and deployment. Using insights from a Java-based protocol suite and supporting subsystem we have implemented, we describe the benefits of using the Java language and quantify the performance cost of implementing a protocol in Java for various combinations of interpretation and compilation. We find that the present performance cost of using Java-based protocols is roughly equivalent to four years of hardware performance gains, i.e., interpreted, Java-based protocol performance on current hardware is roughly equivalent to the performance of compiled C code on four-year-old hardware.},

abstract={Server replication is an approach often used to improve the ability of a service to handle a large number of clients. One of the important factors in the efficient utilization of replicated servers is the ability to direct client requests to the best server, according to some optimality criteria. In this paper we target an environment in which servers are distributed across the Internet, and clients identify servers using our application-layer any-casting service. Our goal is to allocate servers to clients in a way that minimizes a client's response time. To that end, we develop an approach for estimating the performance that a client would experience when accessing particular servers. Such information is maintained in a resolver that clients can query to obtain the identity of the server with the best response time. Our performance collection technique combines server push with client probes to estimate the expected response time. A set of experiments is used to demonstrate the properties of our performance determination approach and to show its advantages when used within the application-layer anycasting architecture.},

abstract={A new multicasting mechanism for RAM-based shared-buffer ATM switches is introduced. Multiple logical output queues, including a new queue for multicast and broadcast cells, are all interleaved into a single physical buffer as in the single-queue switch architecture. Queues are hardware-independent and full buffer-sharing is achieved. Cells are scheduled in the multicast queue based on their priority level and service type as in the unicast queues. A single copy of a multicast cell is kept in the queue. The cell is sent to all of its destinations upon its service time. A unicast cell in a given output queue can still be sent if it has higher priority than a multicast cell. In this case a unicast copy of the multicast cell for that output port is placed in the output queue. This copying scheme requires neither extra hardware nor extra memory space for duplicated cells. A new grouping algorithm is presented which supports the incorporation of the multicast queue and the unicast queues into a single overall queue.},

year={1998},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={808-815 vol.2},
abstract={Memory bandwidth is frequently a limiting factor in the design of high-speed switches and routers. We introduce a buffering scheme called ping-pong buffering, that increases memory bandwidth by a factor of two. Ping-pong buffering halves the number of memory operations per unit time, allowing faster buffers to be built from a given type of memory. Alternatively for a buffer of given bandwidth, ping-pong buffering allows the use of slower, lower-cost memory devices. But ping-pong buffers have an inherent penalty: they waste a fraction of the memory. Unless additional memory is used, the overflow rate is increased; in the worst case half of the memory is wasted. Although this can be compensated by doubling the size of the memory, this is undesirable in practice. Using simulations, we argue that the problem is eliminated by the addition of just 5% more memory. We show that this result holds over a wide range of traffic and switch types, for low or high offered load, and continues to hold when the buffer size is increased.},

year={1998},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={816-823 vol.2},
abstract={Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) local-area networks based on the optical passive-star coupler have traditionally been classified as being either single-hop or multihop. A single-hop network provides a direct connection between the source and the destination of a packet during the packet transfer duration, but may require some amount of coordination between the nodes which may involve tuning of the transmitters or receivers at each node. Since the time required to tune a tunable optical transmitter or receiver may be high, a single-hop network may incur significant overhead. On the other hand, a typical multihop network requires little or no tuning, but a packet may traverse a number of intermediate nodes between the source and destination nodes. Each hop incurs additional queuing delays at each node and also increases the overall load on each link and on the network. We propose a new class of multiconfiguration multihop protocols (MMPs) which use tunable transmitters and receivers to cycle through a number of configurations which together make up. A multihop logical topology. This class of protocols offers a trade-off between the tuning required in a single-hop network and the number of hops required in a multihop network. We present a generalized framework for comparing the proposed protocols with existing single-hop and multihop protocols, and we show that these protocols may offer significant performance gains for systems with high tuning delays and a limited number of transmitters and receivers at each node.},

pages={824-831 vol.2},
abstract={ATM networks are moving to a state where large production networks are deployed and require a universal, open and efficient ATM network control platform (NCP). The emerging PNNI (Private Network to Network Interface) standard introduces an internetworking architecture which can also be used as an intranetwork interface. However, PNNI fails in the latter due to performance limitations, limited functionality and the lack of open interfaces for functional extensions. OPENET is an open high-performance NCP based on performance and functional enhancements to PNNI. It addresses the issues of scalability, high performance and functionality. OPENET focuses on intranetworking and is fully compatible with PNNI in the internetwork environment. The major novelties of the OPENET architecture compared to PNNI is its focus on network control performance. A particular emphasis is given to the increase of the overall rate of connection handling, to the reduction of the call establishment latency and to the efficient utilization of the network resources. These performance enhancements are achieved by the use of a native ATM distribution tree for utilization updates, lightweight signalling and extensive use of caching and pre-calculation of routes. OPENET also extends PNNI functionality. It utilizes a new signalling paradigm that better supports fast reservation and multicast services, a control communication infrastructure which enables the development of augmented services such as directory, hand-off, billing, security etc. OPENET was implemented by the High-Speed Networking group at Sun Labs and is under operational tests.},

abstract={Networks support a wide range of applications with diverse service quality requirements. This demands distinct identification of flows according to their requirements, and the ability to service them differently. Different networking technologies have been evolving towards this common goal. ATM is cost-efficient by exploiting switching. But signaling is slow making ATM unattractive for bursty data traffic. One difficulty with ATM signaling is the inextricable connection between basic connectivity and QoS management. Consequently, every flow, even a best-effort flow suffers the overhead of end-to-end connection establishment. We propose a new lightweight architecture for ATM signaling called UNITE. The fundamental philosophy of UNITE is the separation of connectivity from QoS control. This eliminates the round-trip connection setup delay before initiating data transmission. Using a single cell with proper encoding, we avoid the overhead of reassembly and segmentation on the signaling channel, and enable hardware implementation. Performing QoS negotiation in-band, allows the switches in the path to process QoS-requests in parallel, facilitates connection specific control policies, supports both sender and receiver initiated QoS, and allows for uniform treatment of unicast and multicast connections. UNITE supports variegated multicast trees.},

title={Intelligent voice smoother for VBR voice over ATM networks},
year={1998},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={841-848 vol.2},
abstract={For distinctively transporting voice data with silence suppression over asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks via the variable bit rate (VBR) service, the problem of jitter introduced from the network often renders the speech unintelligible. It is thus indispensable to offer intramedia synchronization to remove jitter while retaining minimal playout delay. We propose a neural-network-based intra-voice synchronization mechanism, called the intelligent voice smoother (IVoS). The IVoS is composed of three components: smoother buffer, neural network (NN) traffic predictor, and constant bit rate (CBR) enforcer. Newly arriving frames, being assumed to follow a generic Markov modulated Bernoulli process (MMBP), are queued in the smoother buffer. The NN traffic predictor employs an on-line-trained backpropagation neural network (BPNN) to predict three traffic characteristics of every newly encountered talkspurt period. Based on the predicted characteristics, the CBR enforcer derives an adaptive buffering delay by means of a near-optimal, simple, closed-form formula. It then imposes such delay on the playout of the first frame in the talkspurt period. The CBR enforcer in turn regulates CBR-based departures for the remaining frames of the talkspurt, aimed at assuring minimal mean and variance of distortion of talkspurts (DOT) and mean playout delay (PD). Simulation results reveal that, compared to three other playout approaches, the IVoS achieves superior playout yielding negligible DOT and PD irrespective of traffic variation.},

title={An adaptive connection admission control policy for VBR/sup +/ service class},
year={1998},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={849-857 vol.2},
abstract={A new service class, called VBR/sup +/ has been proposed for multimedia applications on ATM networks. VBR/sup +/ extends the functionality of the traditional VBR service with the added capability of dynamic resource renegotiation. It makes the specification and modification of the usage parameter controls flexible, and potentially can increase the network resource utilization through statistical multiplexing. These advantages come at the expense of a more complex connection admission controller which should be designed to handle bandwidth renegotiation efficiently. A connection admission controller for the VBR/sup +/ service class is proposed. We identify the desirable features of a VBR/sup +/ connection admission controller, and present a novel one that can achieve them through (1) dynamic resource partitioning, and (2) dynamic resource redistribution among active connections. Simulation results showing the performance of the controller using a number of actual video traces are presented. The results show that the controller is robust in admitting a variety of video sources with widely different traffic burstiness. By partitioning the resource pool dynamically, and distributing resources among contending connections fairly, it can maintain very good quality, and can achieve high utilization. Comparison with the traditional VBR service reveals that the CAC is able to provide comparable quality with higher network utilization.},

pages={858-864 vol.2},
abstract={Consider a set of connections sharing a network node under an allocation scheme that provides each connection with a fixed minimum and a random extra amount of bandwidth and buffer. Allocations and prices are adjusted to adapt to resource availability and user demands. We consider two scenarios of user behavior. In the first scenario a connection purchases an allocation to maximize its expected utility in such a way that the resource cost of the new allocation, and hence its connection charge, remains the same as that for the old allocation. In the second scenario this budget constraint is relaxed and a connection tries to maximize its benefit, expected utility minus the resource cost. Equilibrium is achieved when all connections achieve their optimality and demand equals supply for non-free resources. We show that at equilibrium expected return on purchasing variable resources can be higher than that on fixed resources. Thus connections must balance the marginal increase in utility due to higher return on variable resources and the marginal decrease in utility due to their variability. We further show that in equilibrium where such tradeoff is optimized all connections hold strictly positive amounts of variable bandwidth and buffer.},

abstract={The paper addresses the problem of designing efficient scheduling policies for the transmission of control messages by hierarchical network protocols. Such protocols encounter a tradeoff between the desire to forward a control message across the tree as soon, as it is received, and the desire to reduce control traffic. Scheduling problems that arise in this context are defined and discussed. The paper mainly concentrates on minimizing the average extra delay encountered by the control messages under an upper bound on the number of outgoing messages a node can send during a fixed period of time. A polynomial-time algorithm is presented for the off-line version of the problem, and then several efficient on-line heuristics are presented and compared.},

year={1998},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={873-882 vol.2},
abstract={Calls that make large, persistent demands for network resources will be denied consistent service, unless the network employs adequate control mechanisms. Calls of this type include video conferences. Although overprovisioning network capacity would increase the likelihood of accepting these calls, it is a very expensive option to apply uniformly in a large network, especially as the calls require high bandwidth and low blocking probabilities. Such large calls typically require coordination of geographically distributed facilities and people at the end systems. So it is natural to book the network requirements ahead of their actual use. We present a new, effective admission control algorithm for booking ahead network services. The admission control is based on a novel application of effective bandwidth theory to the time domain. Systematic and comprehensive simulation experiments provide an understanding of how booking ahead affects call blocking and network utilization, considering call duration, number of links, bandwidth, routing, and the mix of book ahead versus immediate arrival traffic. Allowing some calls to book ahead radically reduces their chance of service denial, while allowing flexible and efficient sharing of network resources with normal calls that do not book ahead.},

abstract={This paper explores the performance impact of supporting QoS guarantees on communication in TCP/IP protocol stacks at Unix-like end hosts. We first demonstrate the efficacy of our RSVP-based QoS architecture in providing the desired QoS to individual connections via application-level experiments using UDP sessions and TCP connections on an ATM network. We then identify and measure, via detailed profiling, the overheads imposed by the individual components of the QoS architecture, such as traffic policing, traffic shaping, and buffer management. Our measurements reveal that traffic policing overheads are largely offset by savings due to per-session buffer pre-allocation, and, for ATM networks, a faster path through the network interface layer. In the latter case the data path latency for compliant packets can even be slightly smaller than the default best-effort data path latency. Traffic shaping presents more challenges, primarily because of interactions with the operating system CPU scheduler. We discuss the performance implications of traffic shaping and suggest techniques to reduce or mask some of the associated overheads.},

pages={893-901 vol.2},
abstract={We analyze limited wavelength translation in all-optical, wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) wrap-around mesh networks, where up to W wavelengths, each of which can carry one circuit, are multiplexed onto a network link. All-optical wavelength translators with a limited translation range permit an incoming wavelength to be switched only to a small subset of the outgoing wavelengths. Although more restrictive than full wavelength translation (which permits an incoming wavelength to be switched to any outgoing wavelength), limited wavelength translation is a topic of recent study, since current practical wavelength translators are capable only of limited translation. We consider the case where an incoming wavelength can be switched to one of k (k=2,3) outgoing wavelengths (called the feasible wavelength set), and we obtain the probability that a session arriving at a node at a random time successfully establishes a connection from its source node to its destination node. Our analysis captures the state of a feasible wavelength set at a network node, which allows us to obtain the probability of successfully establishing the circuit. Based on this probability, we quantify the benefits of limited wavelength translation by demonstrating that in mesh networks, it can obtain most of the performance advantages of full translation at a fraction of the cost. Our work is the first to analyze limited wavelength translation for mesh networks under a probabilistic model, and accurately predicts the network performance over a wider range of network loads than previous works.},

title={Design of logical topologies: A linear formulation for wavelength routed optical networks with no wavelength changers},
year={1998},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={919-927 vol.2},
abstract={In this paper we present a exact linear formulation (mixed integer linear program) for designing a logical topology with no wavelength changers. Since the objective of our linear formulation is minimizing the maximum offered load on any link, which is called congestion, the resulting logical topology reflects the traffic intensities between the nodes. Our linear formulation yields a logical topology and routing and wavelength assignment for the logical links. Previously (see IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol.40, no.1, p.840-51, 1996) the problem of logical topology design is considered but the number of wavelengths the fiber can support is not a constraint. In this paper we take into consideration the number of wavelengths the fiber supports, the hop length of a logical link, and show the trade-offs involved in minimizing congestion. Since the whole problem is linearizable the solution obtained by relaxation of the integer constraints yields a lower bound on the congestion. This can be used to compare the efficiency of heuristic algorithms. We solve the problem exactly for a small size network and for large size networks we develop some heuristic algorithms to obtain a feasible solution using the solution obtained by relaxing the integer constraints. We introduce a cutting plane which enables us to reduce the previously obtained upper bounds on congestion. Numerical results for a six node wide area network and the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) are presented for various cases.},

pages={3-10 vol.1},
abstract={This article considers the problem of routing connections with QoS requirements across networks, when the information available for making routing decisions is inaccurate. This uncertainty about the actual state of a network component arises naturally in a number of different environments, which are reviewed in the paper. The goal of the route selection process is then to identify a path that is most likely to satisfy the QoS requirements. For end to end delay guarantees, this problem is intractable. However we show that by decomposing the end-to-end constraint into local delay constraints, efficient and tractable solutions can be established. We first consider the simpler problem of decomposing the end-to-end constraint into local constraints, for a given path. We show that, for general distributions, this problem is also intractable. Nonetheless, by defining a certain class of probability distributions, which posses a certain convexity property, and restricting ourselves to that class, we are able to establish efficient and exact solutions. Moreover, we show that typical distributions would belong to that class. We then consider the general problem, of combined path optimization and delay decomposition. We present an efficient solution scheme for the above class of probability distributions. Our solution is similar to that of the restricted shortest-path problem, which renders itself to near-optimal approximations of polynomial complexity. We also show that yet simpler solutions exist in the special case of uniform distributions.},

pages={19-26 vol.1},
abstract={We focus on the design and performance of resource management controls, specifically state dependent routing, with which to compute the bounds on the end-to-end performance in integrated services networks. The routing control problem at each hop is transformed into an optimization problem, the solution of which suggests a path selection algorithm that relies on the available capacity process at adjacent nodes. We focus on computing a bound on the average end to end packet loss, although our results can easily be adapted to minimize the mean transfer delay. The routing scheme based on the solution to the optimization problem is as follows: each node computes multiple alternate paths to a given destination. The available capacity process, e.g., available bandwidth, available buffer, etc., is derived from the link state updates received at each node and the forwarding rule is based on some function of the maximum available capacity process applied to the set of possible nodes corresponding to the next hop on an alternate path for a particular source destination pair. A consequence of this path selection rule is the pooling of network resources when the load is increased. This allows us to prove the bound (at each hop) on the packet loss in terms of the network parameters. We show how the node reduction technique (and its associated bound) can be used as a building block to compute end to-end performance bounds in a network setting.},

abstract={We consider routing schemes for connections with end to end delay requirements, and investigate several fundamental problems. First, we focus on networks which employ rate-based schedulers and hence map delay guarantees into nodal rate guarantees, as done with the guaranteed service class proposed for the Internet. We consider first the basic problem of identifying a feasible route for the connection, for which a straightforward, yet computationally costly solution exists. Accordingly, we establish several /spl epsiv/-optimal solutions that offer substantially lower computational complexity. We then consider the more general problem of optimizing the route choice in terms of balancing loads and accommodating multiple connections, for which we formulate and validate several optimal algorithms. We discuss the implementation of such schemes in the context of link-state and distance-vector protocols. Next, we consider the fundamental problem of constrained path optimization. This problem, typical of QoS routing, is NP-hard. While standard approximation methods exist, their complexity may often be prohibitive in terms of scalability. Such approximations do not make use of the particular properties of large-scale networks, such as the fact that the path selection process is typically presented with a hierarchical, aggregated topology. By exploiting the structure of such topologies, we obtain an /spl epsiv/-optimal algorithm for the constrained shortest path problem, which offers a substantial improvement in terms of scalability.},

abstract={To meet the increasing capacity demand on wireless networks there have been intense efforts in the past decade on developing multiuser receiver structures which mitigate the interference between users in spread-spectrum and antenna array systems. While much of the research is performed at the physical layer, the capacity of networks with multiuser receivers and the associated resource allocation problems are less well-understood. We show that under some conditions, the capacity of a single cell for several important receivers can be very simply characterized via a notion of effective bandwidth: the QoS requirements of all the users can be met if and only if the sum of the effective bandwidths of the users is less than the total number of degrees of freedom in the system. The number of degrees of freedom is the processing gain in a spread-spectrum system and the number of antenna elements in an antenna array. The effective bandwidth of a user depends only on its own QoS requirement, expressed in terms of the desired signal-to-interference ratio. It is hoped that such an abstraction of resource requirement will help in bridging the resource allocation problems at the networking layer and multiuser techniques at the physical layer.},

pages={43-50 vol.1},
abstract={In this paper, the performance of channel allocation schemes for TDMA type digital mobile cellular systems are studied. We study by simulation the effect of traffic loading and characteristics, including new call arrivals and inter-cell handovers, on blocking and drop out probabilities. The channel allocation schemes under examination includes: (1) fixed channel allocation (FCA) where the number of frequency carriers in each cell is fixed (2) dynamic channel allocation where the number of frequency carriers in each cell is adaptive and dependent on the load, and (3) dynamic frequency/time channel allocation where the number of channels is adaptive (based on the load), allowing two different time division channels of the same frequency carrier to be used in two neighbouring cells. We also study the possible benefit of a simple channel reservation scheme on these systems. We demonstrate that the effects of arrival rate on blocking and drop our probabilities are as expected. As the arrival rate increases, the blocking as well as the drop out probabilities increases. We demonstrate that the implementation of channel reservation is suitable for FCA but not suitable with schemes that is capable of dynamic channel allocation as it may actually worsen drop out rates in such schemes. We also demonstrate that under overload situations, there is no significant benefit in the dynamic schemes and in certain situations they may even perform worse than FCA.},

title={Performance bounds for dynamic channel assignment schemes operating under varying re-use constraints},
year={1998},
volume={1},

pages={51-58 vol.1},
abstract={We derive bounds for the performance of dynamic channel assignment (DCA) schemes which strengthen the existing Erlang bound. The construction of the bounds is based on a reward paradigm as an intuitively appealing way of characterizing the achievable carried traffic region. In one-dimensional networks, our bounds closely approach the performance of maximum packing (MP), which is an idealized DCA scheme. This suggests not only that the bounds are extremely tight, but also that no DCA scheme, however sophisticated, can be expected to outperform MP in any significant manner, if at all. Our bounds extend to scenarios with varying re-use which may arise in the case of dynamic re-use partitioning or measurement-based DCA schemes. In these cases, the bounds slightly diverge from the performance of MP, which inflicts higher blocking on outer calls than inner calls, but not to the extent required to maximize carried traffic. This reflects the trade-off that arises in the case of varying re-use between efficiency and fairness. Asymptotic analysis confirms that schemes which minimize blocking intrinsically favor inner calls over outer calls, whereas schemes which do not discriminate among calls inevitably produce higher network-average blocking.},

pages={59-68 vol.1},
abstract={Improved channel assignment algorithms for cellular networks were designed by modelling the interference constraints in terms of a hypergraph (Sarkar and Sivarajan). However these algorithms only considered cochannel reuse constraints. Receiver filter responses impose restrictions on simultaneous adjacent channel usage in the same cell or in neighbouring cells. An asymptotically tight upper bound for the traffic carried by the system in the presence of arbitrary cochannel and adjacent channel reuse constraints was developed in Deora (1995). However this bound is computationally intractable even for small systems like a regular hexagonal cellular system of 19 cells. We have obtained approximations to this bound using the optimal solutions for cochannel reuse constraints only, and a further graph theoretic approach. Our approximations are computationally much more efficient and have turned out to track very closely the exact performance bounds in most cases of interest. We also present some heuristics for designing fixed channel assignment algorithms with a minimum number of channels satisfying both cochannel and adjacent channel reuse constraints.},

year={1998},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={69-77 vol.1},
abstract={We provide network designs for optical wavelength division multiplexed (OWDM) rings that minimize overall network cost, rather than just the number of wavelengths needed. The network cost includes the cost of the transceivers required at the nodes as well as the number of wavelengths. The transceiver cost includes the cost of terminating equipment as well as higher-layer electronic processing equipment, and in practice, can dominate over the cost of the number of wavelengths in the network. The networks support dynamic (time varying) traffic streams that are at lower rates (e.g., OC-3, 155 Mb/s) than the lightpath capacities (e.g., OC-48, 2.5 Gb/s). A simple OWDM ring is the point-to-point ring, where traffic is transported on WDM links optically, but switched through nodes electronically. Although the network is efficient in using link bandwidth, it has high electronic and opto-electronic processing costs. Two OWDM ring networks are given that have similar performance but are less expensive. Two other OWDM ring networks are considered that are nonblocking, where one has a wide sense nonblocking property and the other has a rearrangeably nonblocking property. All the networks are compared using the cost criteria of number of wavelengths and number of transceivers.},

year={1998},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={78-85 vol.1},
abstract={In this paper we study the problem of dynamic load balancing in broadcast WDM networks by retuning a subset of transceivers in response to changes in the overall traffic pattern. Assuming an existing wavelength assignment and some information regarding the new traffic demands, we present two approaches to obtaining a new wavelength assignment such that (a) the new traffic load is balanced across the channels, and (b) the number of transceivers that need to be retuned is minimized. The latter objective is motivated by the fact that tunable transceivers take a non-negligible amount of time to switch between wavelengths during which parts of the network are unavailable for normal operation. Our main contribution is a new approximation algorithm for the load balancing problem that provides for tradeoff selection, using a single parameter, between the two conflicting goals. This algorithm leads to a scalable approach to reconfiguring the network since, in addition to providing guarantees in terms of load balancing, the expected number of retunings scales with the number of channels, not the number of nodes in the network.},

abstract={This paper considers the problem of scheduling multicast transmissions in a WDM broadcast based local area network. In very high speed networks optimal scheduling may be too time consuming and complex to be executed in real time, thus we are led to consider unscheduled (random) multicast transmissions. We consider two random scheduling schemes: in the first, a message is continuously retransmitted until it is received by all of its intended recipients; and in the second, a random delay is introduced between retransmissions of the same message. We develop an exact throughput analysis for both schemes using methods from discrete-time queueing systems and show that the algorithm with random delays between retransmissions results in higher throughput. Finally, we consider a number of receiver algorithms for selecting among multiple simultaneous transmissions and show that an algorithm where the receiver selects the message with the least number of intended recipients performs better than a random selection algorithm.},

title={Wavelength assignment in a WDM ring to minimize cost of embedded SONET rings},
year={1998},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={94-101 vol.1},
abstract={Discusses wavelength assignment for lightpaths. We study WDM networks in the form of rings and higher level networks as SONET/SDH self-healing rings. This view changes the goal of wavelength assignment (WLA) vs. previous work on the subject in a number of aspects. First, a pair of SONET add/drop multiplexers (ADMs) terminates each lightpath. These ADMs also terminate adjacent lightpaths to form rings, implying that the WLA has to support this type of sharing. Second, following Gerstal et al. (1998), we argue that the first-order optimization goal should be to minimize the overall network cost which is dominated by the number of required ADMs and not the number of wavelengths. These two minimization problems are intrinsically different, and there exist cases where the two minima cannot be simultaneously achieved. We derive a simple lower bound to the number of ADMs and show that this lower bound is not always achievable. Adding wavelength converters to the system does not improve the cost but splitting a lightpath and handling each part separately may reduce the total number of ADMs. We develop two heuristics to minimize the number of ADMs: cut-first, and assign-first. Both heuristics attempt to use the smallest number of ADMs possible. Cut-first always uses the minimum number of wavelengths, but may use more ADMs than necessary. However, the number of extra ADMs is proven to be bounded by the number of supported wavelengths and typically much less. We show instances where cut-first performs better than assign-first and vice versa. Finally, we present a set of transformations that take any WLA and improve its cost.},

The MDSXN is therefore the unification and generalization of the de Bruijn graph and hypercube. We show that members of MDSXN inherit the topological properties of both the de Bruijn graph and hypercube to a varying degree. This allows us to trade-off cost and performance effectively and construct networks which are most suitable for a particular purpose.

abstract={Photonic switching systems based on directional coupler switching elements can switch multiple-wavelength signals at the speed of tera-bits per second. Crosstalk is an intrinsic shortcoming of the directional couplers which must be overcome in the construction of an efficient switching system. Therefore, it adds a new dimension to the design of the networks based on directional couplers. We explore the principles of constructing strictly nonblocking directional coupler-based photonic switching systems under various crosstalk constraints. We show that a lower level of crosstalk can be achieved at a cost of additional hardware. We also introduce a rule that limits the routing of the new connections based on the state of the switching network. Such a rule can significantly reduce the undesired crosstalk and the hardware complexity of the strictly nonblocking network at the same time. The resulting network is therefore categorized as a wide-sense nonblocking network.},

We also present an in depth performance analysis, by simulation, of the HIPERLAN MAC protocol. The analysis is performed by considering data traffic patterns (advanced data traffic) which have a very similar shape to traffic generated by WWW applications. Furthermore, in the analysis we consider Poissonian data traffic too. Our conclusion is that the HIPERLAN MAC protocol performs satisfactorily, although performance measures with advanced traffic are worse than the corresponding performance measures with Poissonian traffic. Furthermore, we broadened our analysis to include the influence of the packet lifetime and channel access priority mechanism on the performance measures provided by HIPERLAN.},

This paper focuses on the efficiency of the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless LANs. Specifically, we derive an analytical formula for the protocol capacity. From this analysis we found (i) the theoretical upper bound of the IEEE 802.11 protocol capacity; (ii) that the standard can operate very far from the theoretical limits depending on the network configuration; (iii) that an appropriate tuning of the backoff algorithm can drive the IEEE 802.11 protocol close to its theoretical limits. Hence we propose a distributed algorithm which enables each station to tune its backoff algorithm at run-time. The performances of the IEEE 802.11 protocol, enhanced with our algorithm, are investigated via simulation. The results indicate that the enhanced protocol is very close to the maximum theoretical efficiency.},

abstract={Energy efficiency is an important issue in mobile wireless networks since the battery life of mobile terminals is limited. Conservation of battery power has been addressed using many techniques. This paper addresses energy efficiency in medium access control (MAC) protocols for wireless networks. The paper develops a framework to study the energy consumption of a MAC protocol from the transceiver usage perspective. This framework is then applied to compare the performance of a set of protocols that includes IEEE 802.11, energy-conserving MAC (EC-MAC), PRMA, multiservices dynamic reservation-TDMA (MDR-TDMA), and distributed-queueing request update multiple access (DQRUMA). The performance metrics considered are transmitter and receiver usage times for packet transmission and reception. The analysis here shows that protocols that aim to reduce the number of contentions perform better from a energy consumption perspective. The receiver usage time, however; tends to be higher for protocols that require the mobile to sense the medium before attempting transmission.},

abstract={We introduce a new stable multiple access protocol for broadcast channels shared by multiple stations, which we call the incremental collision resolution multiple access (ICRMA) protocol. ICRMA dynamically divides the channel into cycles of variable length; each cycle consists of a contention period and a queue-transmission period. The queue-transmission period is a variable-length train of packets, which are transmitted by stations that have been added to the distributed transmission queue by successfully completing a collision-resolution round in a previous contention period. During the contention period, stations with one or more packets to send compete for the right to be added to the data-transmission queue using a deterministic tree-splitting algorithm. A single round of collision resolution is allowed in each contention period. Analytical results show that collision resolution in ICRMA is much more efficient than DQRAP's. Simulation and analytical results show that ICRMA's throughput is within 5% of the throughput achieved by the ideal channel access protocol based on a distributed transmission queue and incremental collision resolution.},

On the other hand, newer generation of ATM chipsets and switches now implement per-VC queueing and scheduling that is capable of providing flow isolation as well as fair sharing of the link bandwidth among contending connections. As a result, ABR congestion control algorithms can now focus on solving the congestion control problem without unnecessarily being burdened by fairness considerations. In this paper, we take advantage of the per-VC queueing/scheduling capability of the new generation of ATM switches and develop an ABR rate-based congestion control algorithm. In contrast to most algorithms that appeared in the literature which are heuristics-based, this algorithm extends previous work (see IEEE/ACM Trans. on Networking, vol.1, no.6, p.693-707, 1993) using a control-theoretic approach and takes advantage of the per-VC queue length information to achieve a simple to implement and yet complete control of the stability, rate of convergence, and performance of ABR service. Simulation results confirm the excellent performance and fairness characteristics achieved by the algorithm.},

abstract={Zero queueing flow control (ZQFC) is a new credit-based flow control method for ATM networks. The receiving node of such a flow-controlled link will have zero queue-occupancy in the steady state. ZQFC uses both link and VC flow control simultaneously over the link to implement the required rate adaptation for achieving zero queueing. Because of its zero queueing property, ZQFC is able to solve a head-of-the-line blocking problem that may arise when multiple VCs share the same receiver buffer in implementing their flow control. ZQFC works well with TCP traffic. When there is any queue buildup associated with a TCP connection in a shared buffer, ZQFC will identify the connection and take steps to reduce its arrival rate at the buffer. This will allow many TCP connections to share the buffer efficiently and fairly. It makes sense to deploy ZQFC for just a single link where performance improvement is critical. Simulations using real-life TCP code have demonstrated these advantages of ZQFC.},

abstract={A significant discovery from this work is that although video traffic has complicated short- and long-range dependence in the time domain, the corresponding wavelet coefficients are no longer long-range dependent in the wavelet domain. Therefore, a "short-range" dependent process can be used to model video traffic in the wavelet domain. In this work, we develop such wavelet models for VBR video traffic. The strength of the developed wavelet models includes: (1) it provides a unified approach to model both long-range and short-range dependence in video traffic simultaneously, (2) it has the ability to reduce the temporal dependence so significantly that the wavelet coefficients can be modeled by either independent or Markov models, and (3) the model results in a computationally efficient method on generating high quality video traffic.},

abstract={Variable bit rate (VBR) Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) coded full-motion video traffic is modeled by a nonlinear time-series process. The threshold autoregressive (TAR) process is of particular interest. The TAR model is comprised of a set of autoregressive (AR) processes that are switched between amplitude sub-regions. To model the dynamics of the switching between the sub-regions a selection of amplitude dependent thresholds and a delay value is required. To this end, an efficient and accurate TAR model construction algorithm is developed to model VBR MPEG-coded video traffic.

abstract={An accurate and treatable Markov-based model for MPEG video traffic is proposed. Before reaching a definition of the model, a large number of MPEG video sequences are analyzed and their statistical characteristics are highlighted. Besides the well-known autocorrelation function, testifying the pseudo-periodicity of the sequence in the short term, and the gamma-shaped probability density function the correlation between different frames belonging to the same group of pictures (GOP) is also accurately studied. Then a structured model is proposed. Thanks to its two-level structure it is able to capture both the inter-GOP and the intra-GOP correlation. In order to obtain the first level of the model, the well-known inverse eigenvalue problem is solved in the discrete-time domain. Finally, the model is used to evaluate the loss probability in an ATM multiplexer loaded by an MPEG video source and an aggregate of external traffic. The accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing the analytically obtained loss probability with the loss probability calculated by simulating the system using real traffic sequences as driven traces.},

abstract={The widely popular World Wide Web along with advances in desktop computers has brought the world into a new age of computing and communications. Low bit-rate video applications across the Internet are quickly emerging. The ITU-T H.263 standard was designed for low bit-rate video conferencing across phone lines and is an ideal candidate to be extended for Internet video applications. This paper focuses on the error robustness issue of compressed H.263 video streams when transmitted over the Internet. The traditional approach of inserting intra-coded frames increases the error resilience at the expense of bursty output traffic, lower picture quality, and uneven frame dropping. By extending the macroblock force update feature of the H.263 standard, we developed a scheme that complies with the standard and increases the robustness of the video stream. This macroblock updating scheme analyzes the temporal dependencies of macroblocks in successive frames and selectively updates the macroblocks which have the most impact on later frames. The performance evaluation of the proposed technique demonstrates that it achieves a good balance between error recovery speeds and video quality.},

abstract={RTP, the Real Time Transport Protocol, has gained widespread acceptance as the transport protocol for voice and video on the Internet. Its companion control protocol, the Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP), is used for loose session control, QoS reporting, and media synchronization, among other functions. The RTP specification describes an algorithm for determining the RTCP packet transmission rate at a host participating in a multicast RTP session. This algorithm was designed to allow the RTP to be used in sessions with anywhere from one to a million members. However, we have discovered several problems with this algorithm when used with very large groups with rapidly changing group membership. One problem is the flood of RTCP packets which occurs when many users join a multicast RTP session at nearly the same time. To solve this problem, we present a novel adaptive timer algorithm called reconsideration. We present a mathematical analysis of this algorithm, and demonstrate that it performs extremely well, reducing the congestion problem by several orders of magnitude. We also back up these results with simulation.},

year={1998},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={242-251 vol.1},
abstract={We study the performance of the TCP in an internetwork consisting of both rate-controlled and non-rate-controlled segments. A common example of such an environment occurs when the end systems are part of IP datagram networks interconnected by a rate-controlled segment, such as an ATM network using the ABR service. In the absence of congestive losses in either segment, the TCP keeps increasing its window to its maximum size. Mismatch between the TCP window and the bandwidth-delay product of the network will result in an accumulation of large queues and possibly buffer overflows in the devices at the edges of the rate-controlled segment, causing degraded throughput and unfairness. We develop an explicit feedback scheme, called explicit window adaptation based on modifying the receiver's advertised window in the TCP acknowledgments returning to the source. The window size indicated to the TCP is a function of the free buffer in the edge device. Results from simulations with a wide range of traffic scenarios show that this explicit window adaptation scheme can control the buffer occupancy efficiently at the edge device, and results in significant improvements in packet loss rate, fairness, and throughput over a packet discard policy such as drop-from-front or random early detection.},

abstract={We analyze the way in which Web browsers use TCP connections based on extensive traffic traces obtained from a busy Web server (the official Web server of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic games). At the time of operation, this Web server was one of the busiest on the Internet. We first describe the techniques used to gather these traces and reconstruct the behavior of the TCP on the server. We then present a detailed analysis of the TCP's loss recovery and congestion control behavior from the recorded transfers. Our two most important results are: (1) short Web transfers lead to poor loss recovery performance for TCPs, and (2) concurrent connections are overly aggressive users of the network. We then discuss techniques designed to solve these problems. To improve the data-driven loss recovery performance of short transfers, we present a new enhancement to the TCP's loss recovery. To improve the congestion control and loss recovery performance of parallel TCP connections, we present a new integrated approach to congestion control and loss recovery that works across the set of concurrent connections. Simulations and trace analysis show that our enhanced loss recovery scheme could have eliminated 25% of all timeout events, and that our integrated approach provides greater fairness and improved startup performance for concurrent connections.},

year={1998},
volume={1},

pages={263-271 vol.1},
abstract={To match an ideal Internet gateway which rigorously enforces fair sharing among competing TCP connections, an ideal TCP sender should possess two properties while obeying congestion avoidance and control principles. First, the TCP sender which under-uses network resources should avoid retransmission time-outs. When experiencing network congestion, a TCP connection should not time-out unless it has already reduced its congestion window to one packet but still cannot survive. Second, the TCP sender which over-uses network resources should lower its bandwidth. The congestion window for a connection should decrease each time a lost packet is detected because an ideal gateway will drop packets, during congestion, with a probability proportional to the bandwidth of the connection. Following these guidelines, we propose network-sensitive Reno (Net Reno), a set of optimizations that can be added to a traditional Reno TCP sender. Using the TCP's self-clocking property and the packet conservation rule, Net Reno improves Reno and its variants (New-Reno and SACK), in reducing TCP retransmission time-outs (RTOs) and in being conservative in network usage during the fast recovery phase. We have shown that over 85% of RTOs are due to small congestion windows that prevent fast retransmission and recovery algorithms from being effective. This implies that sophisticated recovery schemes such as SACK will have limited benefits for these loads. Net Reno overcomes this problem with a small window optimization. Net Reno can recover any number of packet losses without time-outs as long as the network keeps at least one packet alive for the connection.},

year={1998},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={272-281 vol.1},
abstract={The total implementation cost of schedulers which approximate the generalized processor sharing (GPS) policy is dominated by the complexity of maintaining and sorting the time-stamps for all connections. Several approaches have been proposed which reduce the cost of the sorting operation and only introduce a small degradation in the delay bounds of the scheduler; they include logarithmic calendar queues and schedulers supporting a discrete set of guaranteed rates. All these techniques still require computing and storing one time-stamp per connection, thus maintaining the cost of GPS-related algorithms clearly higher than that of less sophisticated schedulers. Furthermore, in the case of the discrete-rate approach, the complexity increases linearly with the number of supported rates, thus making it attractive only for relatively small numbers of rates. In this paper, we introduce a discrete-rate GPS-related scheduler which does not require the computation and storage of one time-stamp per connection, and only maintains a single time-stamp per rate. The elimination of the per-connection time-stamps has no negative effect on the delay bounds. Then, we present a generalized discrete-rate approach, which uses a given number of FIFO queues to support a larger number of guaranteed rates, and only introduces a modest degradation in delay bounds for certain rates. The technique can be applied to our no-per-connection-time-stamp scheduler, as well as to any discrete-rate scheduler.},

title={Implementing distributed packet fair queueing in a scalable switch architecture},
year={1998},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={282-290 vol.1},
abstract={To support the Internet's growth, there is a need for cost effective switching technologies that can simultaneously provide high capacity switching and advanced QoS. Unfortunately, these two goals are largely believed to be contradictory in nature. To support QoS, sophisticated packet scheduling algorithms, such as fair queueing, are needed to manage queueing points. However, the bulk of current research in packet scheduling algorithms assumes an output buffered switch architecture, whereas most high performance switches are input buffered. While output buffered systems may have the desired QoS, they lack the necessary scalability. Input buffered systems, while scalable, lack the necessary QoS features. We propose the construction of switching systems that are both input and output buffered with the scalability of input buffered switches and the robust QoS of output buffered switches. We call the resulting architecture distributed packet fair queueing (D-PFQ) as it enables physically dispersed line cards to provide a service that closely approximates an output-buffered switch with fair queueing. By equalizing the growth of the virtual time functions across the switch system, most of the PFQ algorithms in the literature can be properly defined for distributed operation. We present our system using a cross bar for the switch core. Buffering techniques are used to enhance the system's latency tolerance, which enables the use of pipelining and variable packet sizes internally. We evaluate the delay and bandwidth sharing properties.},

abstract={Traditionally targeted to best-effort packet-switching networks, adaptive applications implement a variety of mechanisms to make use of variable quality bearing service. In the framework of integrated services networks, reducing quality of service (QoS) requirements through the use of such applications allows a greater operation flexibility and increases statistical multiplexing gains. However, these applications must be given some QoS guarantees, relative to minimum service, bounded transmission delay, and fair sharing of the available bandwidth. This paper focuses on a fair queueing, fluid-flow model to be embedded in the network switching nodes. This model is based on the generalized processor sharing (GPS) paradigm, but avoids its inherent limitations. It is approximated by means of a dynamic priority algorithm. It is shown that an implementation having reduced complexity can be achieved and exhibits good service characteristics, relative to packet service delay and conformance to the fluid-flow model fairness. Simulation results give evidence that the resulting algorithm accurately meets the needs of adaptive applications.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the extent to which fair queueing (and its variants), in conjunction with appropriately tailored buffer management schemes, can be used to achieve the following goals for TCP traffic: (1) alleviate the inherent unfairness of TCP towards connections with long round-trip times, (2) provide isolation when connections using different TCP versions share a bottleneck link (3) provide protection from TCP-unfriendly traffic sources (which might include TCP ACKs since they are not loss-responsive) and misbehaving users, (4) alleviate the effects of ACK compression in the presence of two-way traffic, (5) prevent users experiencing ACK loss (which causes their traffic to be bursty) from significantly affecting other connections, (6) provide low latency to interactive connections which share a bottleneck with "greedy" connections without reducing overall link utilization. The paper proposes new buffer management schemes to be used in conjunction with fair queueing, so as to achieve the above goals for TCP, and compares the performance of the proposed schemes to the performance obtained using random early detection (RED) for packet dropping.},

abstract={Providing quality of service (QoS) guarantees for wireless communications requires special consideration for the relatively large and time-varying bit error rates of wireless links, due to impairments that are difficult to predict. We describe a new wireless link access scheme called remote-queueing multiple access (RQMA), which allows seamless integration of scheduling disciplines proposed for wired networks that achieve end-to-end QoS guarantees. RQMA supports the flexible and efficient allocation of bandwidth for real-time sessions. Mobile stations send information about their backlogged packets to a base station which executes a scheduling discipline that provides delay bounds. Some minimum portion of the link bandwidth is reserved for the retransmission of packets that are not correctly received but whose deadlines are still not violated. For a fast fading channel with an average error rate of 10/sup -2/, RQMA is capable of delivering real-time traffic with a small average packet loss rate on the order of 10/sup -5/. Similar performance can be achieved for a slow fading channel if the average error rate is no more than 10/sup -3/.},

abstract={The main purpose of this paper is to assess the feasibility of the distributed control approach in the definition of a wireless ATM MAC protocol. A novel protocol, named D/sup 2/MA, is presented. D/sup 2/MA is based on a double distribution of the access procedure and queueing capabilities. All the reservation and scheduling functions are performed by the mobile stations independently, whereas only passive operations are required to the base station. An accurate analytical model of D/sup 2/MA has been developed. This model examines a single radio cell with a population m of mobile stations acting as traffic sources. Each station is equipped with a finite buffer of B cell size. A comparison with simulation results shows the accuracy of the analytical approach.},

pages={322-331 vol.1},
abstract={A new single channel, time division multiple access (TDMA) based broadcast, scheduling protocol, termed the five-phase reservation protocol (FPRP), is presented for mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol jointly and simultaneously performs the tasks of channel access and node broadcast scheduling. The protocol allows nodes to make reservations within TDMA broadcast schedules. It employs a contention-based mechanism with which nodes compete with each other to acquire TDMA slots. The FPRP is free of the "hidden terminal" problem, and is designed such that reservations can be made quickly and efficiently with negligible probability of conflict. It is fully-distributed and parallel (a reservation is made through a localized conversation between nodes in a 2-hop neighborhood), and is thus arbitrarily scalable. A "multihop ALOHA" policy is developed to support the FPRP. This policy uses a multihop, pseudo-Bayesian algorithm to calculate contention probabilities and enable faster convergence of the reservation procedure. The performance of the protocol is studied via simulation, and the node coloring process is seen to be as effective as an existing centralized approach. Some future work and applications are also discussed.},

year={1998},
volume={1},

pages={332-338 vol.1},
abstract={This paper shows how to improve the classic multi-channel slotted ALOHA protocols by judiciously using redundant transmissions. The focus is on user-oriented requirements: deadlines and a permissible probability of failing to meet them. Subject to those, maximization of throughput is the optimization goal. When there is with no success/failure feedback prior to the deadline, the use of information dispersal with some redundancy provided by error-correcting codes for the data in conjunction with a replicated, separately-transmitted synchronization preamble sharply reduces the overhead resulting from the use of shorter packets and significantly increases the capacity. When the permissible delay is several times greater than the round-trip propagation delay, we propose a novel retransmission policy: all attempts except the final one entail the transmission of a single or very few copies, and the remaining copies are transmitted in the final attempt. This sharply increases channel capacity.},

abstract={We derive asymptotically exact expressions for buffer overflow probabilities and cell loss probabilities for a finite buffer which is fed by a large number of independent and stationary sources. The technique is based on scaling, measure change and local limit theorems and extends the results of Courcoubetis and Weber (see J. Appl. Prob., vol.33, no.3, p.886-903, 1996) on buffer overflow asymptotics. We discuss the cases when the buffers are of the same order as the transmission bandwidth as well as the case of bufferless multiplexers. Moreover we show that the results hold for a wide variety of traffic sources including on/off sources with heavy-tailed distributed on periods which are typical candidates for so-called "self-similar" inputs showing that the asymptotic cell loss probability behaves in much the same manner for such sources as for Markovian type of sources which has important implications for statistical multiplexing. The paper concludes with comparison of the theoretical results with simulations.},

title={Packet multiplexers with adversarial regulated traffic},
year={1998},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={347-355 vol.1},
abstract={We consider a finite-buffer packet multiplexer to which traffic arrives from several independent sources. The traffic from each of the sources is regulated, i.e., the amount of traffic that can enter the multiplexer is constrained by known regulator constraints. The regulator constraints depend on, the source and are more general than those resulting from cascaded leaky buckets. We assume that the traffic is adversarial to the extent permitted by the regulators. For lossless multiplexing, we show that if the original multiplexer is lossless it is possible to allocate bandwidth and buffer to the sources so that the resulting segregated systems are lossless. For lossy multiplexing, we use our results for lossless multiplexing to estimate the loss probability of the multiplexer. Our estimate involves transforming the original system into two independent resource systems, and using adversarial sources for the two independent resources to obtain a bound on the loss probabilities for the transformed system. We show that the adversarial sources are not extremal on-off sources, even when the regulator consists of a peak rate controller in series with a leaky bucket. We explicitly characterize the form of the adversarial source for the transformed problem. We also provide numerical results for the case of the simple regulator.},

volume={1},
number={},
pages={356-363 vol.1},
abstract={The interest sparked by observations of long-range dependent traffic in real networks has lead to a revival of interest in non-standard queueing systems. One such queueing system is the M/G/1 queue where the service-time distribution has infinite variance. The known results for such systems are asymptotic in nature, typically providing the asymptotic form for the tail of the workload distribution, simulation being required to learn about the rest of the distribution. Simulation however performs very poorly for such systems due to the large impact of rare events. We provide a method for numerically evaluating the entire distribution for the number of customers in the M/G/1 queue with power-law tail service-time. The method is computationally efficient and shown to be accurate through careful simulations. It can be directly extended to other queueing systems and more generally to many problems where the inversion of probability generating functions complicated by power-laws is at issue. Through the use of examples we study the limitations of simulation and show that information on the tail of the queue-length distribution is not always sufficient to answer significant performance questions. We also derive the asymptotic form of the number of customers in the system in the case of a service-time distribution with a regularly varying tail (e.g. infinite variance) and thus illustrate the techniques required to apply the method in other contexts.},

pages={364-371 vol.1},
abstract={We study P({Q>x}), the tail of the steady state queue length distribution at a high-speed multiplexer. The tail probability distribution P({Q>x}) is a fundamental measure of network congestion and thus important for the efficient design and control of networks. In particular, we focus on the case when the aggregate traffic to the multiplexer can be characterized by a stationary Gaussian process. In our approach, a multiplexer is modeled by a fluid queue serving a large number of input processes. We propose two asymptotic upper bounds for P({Q>x}), and provide several numerical examples to illustrate the tightness of these bounds. We also use these bounds to study important properties of the tail probability. Further, we apply these bounds for a large number of non-Gaussian input sources, and validate their performance via simulations. We have conducted our simulation study using importance sampling in order to improve its reliability and to effectively capture rare events. Our analytical study is based on extreme value theory, and therefore different from the approaches using traditional Markovian and large deviations techniques.},

title={Performance issues in VC-merge capable switches for IP over ATM networks},
year={1998},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={372-380 vol.1},
abstract={VC merging allows many routes to be mapped to the same VC label, providing a scalable mapping method that can support tens of thousands of edge routers. VC merging requires reassembly buffers so that cells belonging to different packets intended for the same destination do not interleave with each other. The impact of VC merging on the additional buffer required for the reassembly buffers and other buffers due to the perturbation in the traffic process is investigated. We propose a realistic output-buffered ATM switch architecture that supports VC merging capability. We analyze the performance of the switch using a decomposition approach, and verify the results using simulation. We investigate the impact of VC merging on loss and delay performance for realistic traffic scenarios. The main result indicates that VC merging incurs a minimal overhead compared to non-VC merging in terms of additional buffering. Moreover, the overhead decreases as utilization increases, or as the traffic becomes more bursty. The finding has important implication since practical ATM switches are dimensioned for high utilization and stressful traffic conditions. We also study the delay performance and find that the additional delay due to VC merging is insignificant for most applications.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel approach for adaptive flow classification for flow-based hybrid switching systems to match the time varying traffic/resource characteristics. It minimizes the maximum of the system resource utilizations associated with packet processing power, signalling capacity and routing table size. After formulating the proposed flow adaptation as a min-max stochastic control problem, a heuristic algorithm is developed. The simulation study based on real traces shows the viability of the proposed flow adaptation for dynamic resource management in hybrid switching system design. The algorithm is simple to implement and only requires the adaptation of two global variables at time intervals of every few seconds based on the present usage of resources.},

abstract={Multi-service ATM networks will be deployed in internetwork environment to relay IP traffic, including elastic packet flows generated by adaptive network applications. In light of this advance, we devise flow-aware traffic management framework for the better-than-best-effort support of long-duration adaptive IP flows over ATM. It requires the applications and the ATM gateways to periodically exchange hints indicating up-to-dated flow information. This two-way explicit indication mechanism facilitates improved interactions between applications and the network, and increased coordination between end-to-end and link-level traffic control. Network hints help an application to adapt and avoid congestion, while application hints enable an ATM gateway to selectively aggregate and map packet flows into ATM VCs, to regulate CBR bandwidth, and to interoperate with ABR rate-based flow control. Via simulation and experimentation, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this framework in balancing application performance and bandwidth efficiency in the use of CBR VCs, and in improving ATM link utilization and avoiding gateway congestion in the use of ABR VCs.},

pages={401-408 vol.1},
abstract={The desire to switch ATM cells at high speed and forward data packets in a connectionless (CL) manner poses a challenging architectural difficulty that has not yet been satisfactorily resolved. This difficulty is mainly due to lack of a packet concept in ATM switches-a packet is a level-3 abstraction, totally hidden from the switch. The switch-borne router (SBR) is a proposed switch/router architecture that makes it possible to switch CL packets at very high speed using ATM technology. This paper introduces the SBR and compares its performance with other forwarding methods using a simulator. Compared to other methods, the SBR allows for a significantly smaller number of open/close VC operations per second, has less buffering requirement, and achieves higher throughput. The same results hold using a real-life Internet packet trace as well as using traffic drawn from a synthetic workload generator.},
