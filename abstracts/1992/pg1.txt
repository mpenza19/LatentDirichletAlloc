year={1992},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-12 vol.1},
abstract={The authors present an approach to computing access control parameters as a function of both source characteristics and bandwidth allocation in the network. The technique relies on a fluid-flow model for the source, the leaky bucket rate control system, and the bandwidth allocation process. The methodology is suitable for any high-speed packet switching architecture. The approach allows for the real-time setting of the access control at a connection setup. It ensures that the access control mechanism is near transparent as long as connections behave as expected, while protecting the network from most misbehaving connections. Although some extreme cases have the potential to affect the network, they are essentially due to limitations inherent in the leaky bucket itself.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors indicate that the number of rates supportable in an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) broadband network has to be limited unless a network is acceptable without knowing its grade of service. The quantization of the channel bandwidth, given the traffic arrival rate as a function of requested bandwidth, is considered. Capacity sharing models in ATM networks are presented. The calculation procedure for blocking probability which will be affected by the quantization problem is described. A class of control methods that can render a product-form solution is introduced. The results indicate that there is little performance difference between a quantized channel and a continuous-rate channel as the level of quantization exceeds ten.<<ETX>>},

year={1992},

pages={2124-2133 vol.3},
abstract={A network with N stations connected via a passive star coupler using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is considered. Each station is equipped with a transmitter, transmitting at a fixed frequency, and a tunable receiver, capable of receiving frequencies over the entire transmitting spectrum. Two reservation-based protocols are proposed for a local area network (LAN) environment: the dynamic allocation scheme (DAS), which dynamically assigns slots on a packet-by-packet basis, and the hybrid TDM scheme (HTDM) which is a combination of TDM and the DAS, allowing both preassigned slot and dynamic slot assignment. Analytical results are derived for the delay performance of the two schemes and these results are compared with that of the TDM. It is shown that the performance of DAS is close to optimal when the propagation delay is zero. However, it requires a large signaling bandwidth. On the other hand, HTDM has lower signaling needs, provides lower delays when compared to TDM (particularly under nonuniform traffic conditions), and is capable of handling bursty data traffic. Thus, HTDM offers a more practical solution for implementation for LANs.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The design of a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) passive star network must address the following limitations of the optical hardware technologies: a limited number of transmitters and receivers at each node; the unavailability of rapidly tuning transmitters and receivers; and the mismatch between the electronic processing rates and the optical transmission bandwidth. The authors investigate the use of regular virtual topologies as an efficient solution that incorporates the above hardware limitations, while providing high system utilization and low end-to-end delays. The following regular topologies are investigated: Shufflenet, binary hypercube, generalized hypercube, and two-dimensional torus. A number of performance and hardware related metrics are introduced that reflect the use of these topologies in a high speed optical environment. Based on these metrics, along with upper and lower bounds developed for performance and hardware requirements, the authors evaluate and compare the selected regular topologies. They also address the issue of mapping the regular virtual topologies into a WDM star network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The first time-wavelength assignment algorithm for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) star-based local and metropolitan area networks is presented. The algorithm incorporates the unique aspects of WDM communication such as a number of tunable transmitters and receivers at each concentrator, the tuning time, and a limited number of wavelengths. The transmission duration is composed of two elements: the packet transmission time, and the overhead incurred due to the tunability of the system's transmitters and receivers. For a given traffic matrix, the algorithm obtains a TDM/WDM schedule with minimal packet transmission duration, while minimizing the tuning time.<<ETX>>},

pages={2151-2160 vol.3},
abstract={A discrete-time queuing system supporting two classes of customers (packets of information) with different priorities is analyzed. Unlike the head-of-the-line priority policy, the priority policy considered provides for limited service to the low-priority class, even in the presence of high-priority customers (considerate system). At the same time, it guarantees that no low-priority customer will be served before a previously arrived high-priority one (guaranteed policy fairness). The proposed policy can be seen as a compromise between the head-of-the-line priority policy and the classical gated/limited service priority policy. A general methodology is developed for the analysis of this policy.<<ETX>>},

pages={2161-2167 vol.3},
abstract={The authors consider a service system in which n servers render service to two classes of prioritized traffic, which arrive to the system according to independent Poisson processes. Newly arriving call requests are granted server access on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) basis as long as there are fewer than g servers occupied. If fewer than g servers are free at the arrival time of a lower priority customer, the higher priority call requests are granted immediate service unless all servers are busy, in which case the call is dropped. This model has been used to study the handoff problem in a cellular telephone system, but the analytic approach taken was very complicated. The authors present a simple, novel, alternative approach to solving for the equilibrium probabilities for the number of lower priority calls in the queue and other quantities of interest. They describe two additional alternative approaches based on Neuts' matrix analytic approach for checking results, and point out that while the results of all these approaches agree with each other, they differ from previously published results. Because these three approaches are essentially independent, it is conjectured that there are problems with the earlier numerical results. Further work has revealed that this is the case.<<ETX>>},

volume={},

pages={2168-2177 vol.3},
abstract={The author uses a generating function approach with spectral decomposition for discrete queuing analysis with arrival and service Markov chains (MCs). The complexity of this approach lies in the construction of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for both arrival and service generating function matrices. A MC is called decomposable if it can be decomposed into a set of smaller MCs, where each of them has a number of states less than five. For decomposable arrival and service MCs, it is shown how to construct steady-state queuing solutions on the basis of simple Kronecker product properties. The evaluation of each individual root is well decomposed in a simple convergent form. As an example, the author has constructed solutions for those MCs decomposed in units of heterogeneous two-state MCs. In numerical studies the significant effect of large time-varying scales of arrival/service processes on queue length distribution has been explored.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The problem of multiplexing time-critical (TC) and time-non-critical (TNC) packetized information in an integrated services digital network (ISDN) is considered. An appropriate time division multiplexing (TDM) scheme is adopted to accommodate the strict delay requirements for the TC traffic. The resulting system is different from those previously considered in at least two aspects. First, the TNC traffic is assumed to exhibit correlation between consecutive slots. Second, the TC traffic is not necessarily accommodated in a contiguous subframe, but it may be spread over the whole frame according to any pattern. The nongated service policy is adopted for the service of the TNC traffic, unlike most of the past work. A very flexible approach is developed for the exact analysis of the proposed TDM scheme. Numerical results are derived for the case of TC traffic generated by voice sources.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors address the problem of identifying the topology of a network from data collected at a designated node (possibly one of the network nodes). The data considered are descriptions of the local neighborhood about each node, which specify the identities of the node and of its neighbors. These data are neither required to be correct nor complete. The authors propose a model that describes and relates the network topology and the data. They define costs associated with this model, and reduce the identification problem to a combinational optimization problem with and an objective function based on these costs. A pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm is derived, which yields a local minimum of the objective function. The local minimum appears to be a reasonable solution, as shown by a range of examples.<<ETX>>},

The authors then propose and compare three different polynomial-time greedy algorithms, on the basis of performance and time complexity. Noticing that the length of a sequence increases at most linearly with the size of the network, the authors derived the average rate of growth from simulation results.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The generalized Erlang blocking model has been used to analyze multiplexing, message storage, and communication network performance. The author modifies this model to permit blocked requests to retry, with reduced resource requirements and arbitrary mean residency requirements. Because the modification of the generalized Erlang model destroys the product-form structure and greatly increases the size of the state space, and exact solution is out of the question. The present approach modifies a well-known one-dimensional recursion developed for the generalized Erlang model in an intuitively satisfying manner, and results in an approximation scheme that is both efficient and quite accurate. This study arose in the context of high-speed networks in which high bandwidth but non-real-time messages may, upon being blocked, request service with smaller bandwidth and larger residency time, as long as the bandwidth-residency time product is the same as originally requested.<<ETX>>},

volume={},

pages={2233-2240 vol.3},
abstract={The authors propose a burst level bandwidth reservation scheme which is appropriate for an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network that supports the transfer of high-speed burst traffic. The proposed scheme utilizes multiple links and multiple paths in a network to transfer individual bursts, thereby increasing network efficiency. As the link and path selection is implemented on a burst-by-burst basis, instead of the cell-by-cell basis used in the conventional multilink approach, the proposed scheme does not require a cell-by-cell distributor and out-of-order cell delivery is avoided, which was the disadvantage of the conventional cell-by-cell multilink approach. Performance evaluation showed that the delay and blocking probability characteristics are greatly improved, as the number of links between each pair of adjacent nodes and the number of source-destination paths increase. For example, around 40% link utilizations are achieved with 16 multiple links, while the conventional single-link schemes yield only to 1% link utilization to guarantee the same quality requirements. It is shown that the proposed scheme works well if the round-trip propagation delay is less than about 10% of the burst duration.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors propose a fairness criterion for sharing spare (unallocated) capacity among different nonguaranteed bursty data sources with different relative usage values. Based on this criterion, the throughput of some sources may be controlled in the case where the total average offered traffic within a certain small time interval is greater than the total available spare capacity. It is proposed that all controlled sources will enjoy a share of capacity which is proportional to their relative usage values, and that no uncontrolled source will enjoy higher relative throughput than a controlled source. This criterion uniquely defines a set of throughputs for all sources. A method to compute these throughput values which has been demonstrated by several examples has been presented.<<ETX>>},

Analytical models have been developed for network architectures with a connectivity degree equal to four: the bidirectional Manhattan street network (BMSN) and the shuffle net (SN). The authors evaluate the performance under uniform traffic distribution and also under the realistic assumption that the user's attachments to network nodes are equipped with input and output buffers. The performances under investigation are throughput, average delay, and packet loss. The availability of an analytical model makes it possible to investigate the performance of networks with a large number of nodes. The strong and weak points of the two M-MAN architectures are pointed out in the discussion of the results.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors describe a performance study of a trial switched multimegabit data service (SMDS) link (intended for inter-LAN connection) from the perspective of customers evaluating the feasibility of the link for some target applications. The goals were to take all measurements on the customer premises and to develop a methodology general enough to be used by customers to evaluate the link. The authors measured a lightly loaded system and developed a model of the SMDS connection suitable for evaluating applications via analysis or simulation. They document their methodology and present the SMDS connection delay values as well as a likely breakdown of the constituents of that delay. They used these data to create a simulation model and to simulate a simple application. In the trial configuration, where geographical distances were small, SMDS network delay was one of the notable components of end-to-end delay in the SMDS connection. However, for most packets, throughput is limited by the T1 capacity for transmitting SMDS cells, not by the SMDS network capacity.<<ETX>>},

pages={2453-2462 vol.3},
abstract={The authors analyze the flow enforcement algorithm suitable for regulating the flow of the bursty traffic in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks (for broadband packet switching). The flow enforcement algorithm has two objectives: to force the input traffic to conform to the traffic parameters which are specified by the source itself at its connection time; and to obtain greater performance gain at the cell multiplexer by regulating the flow to some extent. The authors reveal the tradeoff relationship between the regulation level of the cell flow and the improvement of the link performance. The authors first analyze the flow enforcement mechanism to derive the delay distribution and the interdeparture time distribution for cells at the flow enforcer. For the input traffic, they allow the general independent arrivals of cells to represent the traffic burstiness larger than a Poisson distribution. The obtained interdeparture time distributions from the flow enforcer are then used to approximately analyze the performance of the cell multiplexer. For this purpose, a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP) approximation method is extended to investigate the performance of individual traffic stream in the superposed arriving traffic streams.<<ETX>>},

pages={2463-2471 vol.3},
abstract={The author discusses two in-call buffer/window negotiation schemes for short intermittent file transfers, focusing on the specific needs of such traffic streams. A closed network of queues models is developed to show the behavior of the proposed schemes. These models, while simple, capture essential details of the control schemes. Under fairly general assumptions, the resulting network of queues is of product form and can be analyzed using the mean value analysis. The author uses such an analysis to compare the proposed schemes and to determine appropriate sizes of trunk buffers to achieve the desired balance between bandwidth utilization and file transfer delay. The effects of other parameters on the performance of these schemes as well as on the buffer sizing rules are discussed. In-call parameter negotiation may be carried out by the end system with the network elements or by the access controller with the internal network elements. The author discusses implications of this location as well as the needed protocol features. The service discrimination capabilities desired at the trunk controller in switching modes are discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A flow model for evaluating the performance of a network of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches is presented. The performance measures used include the link (nodal) and end-to-end cell loss probabilities as well as the link (nodal) and end-to-end cell delays. In the model, the routing assignments are assumed to be given. The assumed form of routing assignments may be used to represent either virtual circuit or datagram service. Due to the nonlinear relationship between cell losses and offered flows, the flow model is a system of nonlinear equations. The authors develop a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique solution to the nonlinear system of equations. They present an iterative model and prove that it converges to a unique fixed point provided the sufficient condition is satisfied. The unique fixed point corresponds to the unique solution to the flow model.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A novel cell switching architecture for asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)-based networks is presented. The proposed helical switch is a multistage interconnection network which implements the self-routing technique with efficient buffer sharing. Although the switch may route cells along multiple paths, the connection-oriented mode required by the ATM-based network is supported. Cell sequence integrity is guaranteed by introducing a virtual helix which forces cells routed along different paths to proceed in order and fill the internal buffers uniformly. Under a uniform traffic pattern, it is shown that the minimum achievable throughput is 5/6 per output line.<<ETX>>},

pages={2499-2508 vol.3},
abstract={The authors propose a cell scheduling algorithm to increase the throughput of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching system with services of diverse priority classes. The maximum throughput is increased up to 0.949. The efficiency (output trunk utilization)/(input trunk utilization) is almost equal to 100%, and is almost independent of the switch size and the traffic load. The cell scheduling algorithm is shown to be able to provide high throughput not only for higher priority classes but also for lower priority classes. The mean cell waiting time of the highest priority class are transmitted as soon as possible. In the switching system implemented with the present cell scheduling algorithm, it is sufficient for a sorting network to establish input/output paths through it simultaneously without conflicts and it is not necessary to append a routing network to a sorting network.<<ETX>>},

pages={2509-2515 vol.3},
abstract={A novel packet switch architecture using two sets of time division multiplexed (TDM) buses is proposed. The horizontal buses collect packets from the input ports while the vertical buses distribute the packets to the output ports. The two sets of buses are connected by a set of switching elements which coordinate the connections between the horizontal buses and the vertical buses so that each vertical bus is connected to only one horizontal bus at a time. The switch has the advantages of: (1) it adds input and output ports without increasing the bus and I/O adaptor speed; (2) it is internally unbuffered; (3) it has a very simple control circuit; and (4) it has 100% potential throughput under uniform traffic. A combined analytical-simulation method is used to obtain the packet delay and packet loss probability. Numerical results show that for satisfactory performance the buses need to run about 30% faster than the input line rate. With this speedup, even at a utilization factor of 0.9, the input queue can give a packet loss of 10/sup -6/ with only 31 buffers per input adaptor. The output queue behaves essentially as an M/D/1 queue.<<ETX>>},

The traffic on each input line is modeled as a two-state Markov chain. The distribution of the busy and idle periods for each output line is analytically derived. It is concluded that it is not easy to identify a simple two-state Markov chain model that provides an adequate description for the output traffic. The implications of two different output line address assignment mechanisms for the incoming cells are quantitatively described. An alternative method is outlined for the computation of the steady-state distribution of the number of cells in the system. An analysis of the numerical results is presented.<<ETX>>},

A job that arrives at the network during the time that the current number of jobs of the same class is equal to the population constraint, is forced to wait in an external queue. A method is presented for obtaining an approximate solution of such a queueing network. The method is based on the use of an equivalent closed queuing network model, which is analyzed using an approximate product-form solution technique. The performance parameters of the original open queueing network are easily derived from the equivalent closed queueing network. Numerical results show that this method is fairly accurate.<<ETX>>},

Since the cell loss requirements within ATM networks are very restrictive, interest is in the tail of the complementary probability distribution function of the end-to-end delay to estimate the cell loss probability at the reassembly buffer. An analytical approach for an isolated network node as well as for a whole reference connection is presented. The approximation results are in good agreement with simulation results and indicate that the end-to-end delay jitter is in the range of the maximum transfer delay of one queuing node, if the bursty input traffic is controlled by adequate traffic control mechanisms.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A dynamic window model is developed which provides admission control for circuit switched networks through the signaling network. This model incorporates distributed processing while achieving desired global congestion control effects. It reflects the interaction between the circuit switched path in the telephone network and the packet switched path in the signaling network. The model is solved by applying the concept of parametric analysis to study the whole circuit switching subnetwork as a composite server. The variant service rate is derived for the composite server of the circuit switch trunk in the context of a closed chain where the arrival of call services is finite. To avoid overflow and combinatorial complex problems, the computation is reduced to the Erlang recursive form. Mean value analysis formulas are derived for the model. Examples are given to demonstrate the validation of the analysis.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A general-purpose decomposition method is formulated for the exact analysis of blocking probabilities in multirate circuit-switched networks. The procedure is based on a decomposition and aggregation technique that exploits the sparsity that can be found in the routing matrix of a network. Use is also made of a recursive algorithm developed by the authors (see Ann. Oper. Res. vol.35, no.1-4, p.31-41, 1992). No special assumptions are made with regard to the structure of the network. By reducing the analysis to that of a set of interrelated subsystems and a reduced system, the overall dimensionality of the problem is diminished, and the computational costs are reduced significantly. This enables the efficient exact analysis of larger network models. An example is provided to illustrate the computational savings that can be realized.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Low delay or low loss (LDOLL) queuing policies for asynchronous transfer model (ATM) fast packet switching allow either retrieval priority or storage priority to be given to the ATM cells of traffic streams with different performance requirements. The improvements in performance that can be achieved by using one bit in the ATM cell header to make the binary LDOLL distinction are analyzed. In the analysis, simulation of the level, where the cell transmission rate of a source may vary between zero and the peak rate and computation at the level, where queuing of individual cells is considered, are combined. It is shown that LDOLL queuing, compared with FIFO queuing in ATM switches, can reduce cell loss probability by many orders of magnitude for low loss traffic. Low delay traffic incurs a slightly higher cell loss which is compensated with a reduced cell delay mean and variance.<<ETX>>},

Five alternative algorithms for bandwidth allocation to video sources are considered using: static-slot assignment, buffer-population-based dynamic slot assignment, first-come-first-serve slot assignment and rate-based dynamic slot assignment. The average cell delay and the coefficient of variation of the delay for the five algorithms are determined by computer simulation and compared.

abstract={Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is being suggested as the basis for future high speed, universal networks. A key requirement for future ATM networks will be transparency, i.e. for the network to alter or manipulate the user information as little as possible. A transparent transport mechanism, plaNET, based on extensions of the current ATM standard and IBM's earlier PARIS technology, is proposed. It is shown how plaNET can satisfy the universal transport requirement of ATM, while avoiding some demonstrated deficiencies. In fact, plaNET could be viewed as an enhanced version of ATM that may be more suitable for the late 1990s than the current standard.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The use of independence assumptions has made it possible to derive an approximate model of deflection-routing networks that have multibuffer stations and two-connected topologies. A procedure is presented for estimating the mean transport time (and throughput) of these networks, even when the offered traffic is nonuniform. The proposed procedure is efficient and yields very accurate results, as comparisons with simulations have confirmed. The model is quite general and can be applied to deflection-routing networks that deflect packets according to destination-based priorities. The authors have modeled only a few of the several options for designing a deflection-routing network. In particular, they have modeled a network with no user input buffers, a specific admission-routed policy, and destination-based priorities.<<ETX>>},

The implementation constraints associated with a centralized switch are demonstrated and an alternative distributed optical network architecture is described. The distributed approach exploits unique opportunities presented through the use of a passive optical medium. A network based on these principles (TeraNet), has been implemented that offers user access rates of 1 Gbit/s. The distributed ATM switch fabric resides in small, geographically dispersed access stations interconnected by a shared, all-optical medium carrying many wavelength-multiplexed channels. Although the underlying multihop architecture for the ATM network produces a lower per-port throughput than that afforded by a large centralized ATM switch, significant implementation advantages exist. Possible techniques to yield a higher per-port throughput approaching that of a large centralized switch are also discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors consider the problem of traveling with least expected delay in networks whose link delays change probabilistically according to Markov chains. This is a typical routing problem in dynamic computer communication networks. They formulate several optimization problems, posed on infinite and finite horizons, and consider them with and without using memory in the decision making process. It is proved that all these problems are, in general, intractable. However, for networks with nodal stochastic delays, a simple polynomial optimal solution is presented. This is typical of high-speed networks, in which the dominant delays are incurred by the nodes. For more general networks, a tractable epsilon -optimal solution is presented. The performance of a regular shortest-path algorithm in such an environment is considered.<<ETX>>},

It is assumed that each node knows the current state of its own outgoing links and the state-transition probabilities for every link of the network. It is shown that the general problem is #P-complete, and two special cases are considered: case 1 assumes the network is a directed acyclic graph oriented toward the destination, and case 2 assumes that the link states are independent from slot to slot. For each case, it is proved that the optimal routing strategy has a simple state-independent representation. An efficient algorithm is presented for finding the optimal strategy. },

abstract={The IEEE 802-6 DQDB protocol solves the existing problems in prior round-robin high-speed MAC protocols. However, it introduces a new performance unfairness problem when the network size or channel bandwidth increases. The pi-persistent protocol, on the other hand, does not pass any control information over the channels, and was shown capable of achieving various fairness criteria, when each station knows the loads of all other stations. The authors propose a dynamic pi-persistent protocol that is capable of adjusting the network to fair operation in an environment where the station loads change over time. The protocol requires passing of some control information through the network. The information passed is not as detailed as the request information in DQDB. The authors analyze the performance of the protocol in a batch arriving model for load increase. The results show that the protocol is both fast and accurate in responding to network load changes.<<ETX>>},

In contrast to previous successful approaches to loop-free routing, LDR maintains DBF's row-independence property and does not require internodal coordination spanning multiple loops. The new algorithm is shown to be loop-free and to converge in a finite time after an arbitrary sequence of topological changes.

abstract={An improved network architecture which incorporates high reliability, high performance, and optimal accommodation to environmental topologies is presented. The network investigated is tree-shaped, where the leaves represent host computers or loop subnetworks and the vertices are ring adapters attaching hosts or bridges interconnecting subnetworks. For ease of modeling only balanced and homogeneous structures are considered where loop subnetworks have the same topology. Multilevel hierarchical loop networks have minimal diameter when the number of nodes in the subnetworks is proportional to the root of the number of all attached stations. In this case, the diameter grows only with the logarithm of the number of stations. This implies that network reliability and performance are significantly improved using the proposed multilevel hierarchical architecture. The performance analysis assumes the protocol of buffer insertion.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A potential problem with distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) is the achievement of fair sharing of bandwidth in terms of the location of the access node for queued arbitrated access. To compensate for this unfairness, the IEEE 802.6 standard recommends utilizing a bandwidth balancing (BWB) mechanism with the proper value of the system parameter named BWB-MOD. The authors study and analyze the DQDB performance and the fairness with both BWB-on and BWB-off for some influential parameters based on the simulation results. For light load condition, the performance approximation is established with remarkable accuracy. It is also shown that the BWB mechanism is effective on fairness only in overload condition. An effective BWB-MOD assignment method is examined. This method indicates the appropriate value of BWB-MOD to optimize the tradeoff between the average performance of the DQDB protocol and the fairness achieved by the BWB mechanism.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present an analytical approach to the performance analysis of multihop lightwave networks with hot-potato routing and multiclass traffic. Explicit closed-form expressions are derived for the hop distribution and the probability of 'don't care'. The computational complexity is thus reduced as compared to previous approaches, and priorities are readily handled. Results for two different classes of traffic are given. The probability of a packet belonging to a particular class of traffic existing on a preferred path is calculated by finding the fixed point of a scale function. The throughput and network delay as well as queuing delay of a particular class are then calculated using the expressions derived for them.<<ETX>>},

abstract={To use queuing theory to analyze real systems such as computer communications networks, one makes assumptions that are, strictly speaking, untrue. The authors provide an exact analysis for cases with greatly relaxed assumptions. Service times can have general increasing failure rate distributions, different by class even at FIFO nodes. Routing can be arbitrary, including dependencies along the route, provided the number of visits to each node is a random variable. Only the mean service time and mean visit rates at nodes need be specified. A lower throughput bound is found which gives a minimum guaranteed throughput for each class; together with the familiar multiclass asymptotic upper bounds they give a convex feasible region in a multidimensional throughput space. A detailed analysis is given for systems with FIFO and infinite-server nodes, and the extension to processor-sharing nodes is described. The results can be reinterpreted as a set of bounds on the separate throughputs. This is equivalent to a circumscribed rectangular region called the robust box bounds.<<ETX>>},

Traditionally, the computation of user-oriented performance criteria such as the average delay has been carried out via steady-state analysis of queuing theoretic models of communication networks. It is shown that the steady-state computations are often not sufficient for QOS purposes in future high-speed networks. The authors provide mechanisms for computing and guaranteeing QOS criteria and consider the issue of approximate QOS criteria. It is argued that, for certain envisaged applications, traditional QOS criteria are not appropriate. A QOS criterion for such applications is proposed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An efficient computational procedure to calculate the queue size distribution in a finite buffer queuing system with a number of independent sources is presented. Each source is characterized by a finite state discrete-time Markov chain. An explicit expression for the queue size distribution is obtained directly. The method is based on computing the modified spectral expansion of the state distribution of the system. This representation requires evaluating the roots of the entire system characteristic function and solving a set of linear system equations. Exact results show that the cell loss probability depends only on the ratio of the buffer capacity to burst length. An approximation expression for the cell loss probability based on asymptotic analysis is also presented. Numerical results show that the approximation is accurate, especially when the system load is heavy. The effect of burst length on the cell loss probability is investigated.<<ETX>>},

By means of a generating function approach, a technique to derive the moments of the buffer occupancy is developed, and an explicit expression for the mean buffer occupancy is given. Furthermore, an approximate method is presented to obtain a tight upper bound for the tail distribution of the buffer occupancy, especially for large traffic load.<<ETX>>},

pages={656-663 vol.2},
abstract={The authors propose a multichannel lightwave network with a grouping property which exhibits better channel efficiency as the traffic is more likely within groups. The network also avoids both wavelength agility and pretransmission coordination problems. Two network topologies are considered. One is a multichannel lightwave network with full connection within groups. While it requires many receivers in each network interface unit (NIU) it exhibits low queuing delay and high network capacity. The other is a multichannel lightwave network with minimal connection within groups. While it gives relatively poor delay-throughput characteristics, a network can be constructed with each NIU having only two fixed-wavelength receivers. The network capacities and the mean queuing delays for the two network topologies are presented.<<ETX>>},

pages={2045-2054 vol.3},
abstract={The authors extend the use of traditional point-to-point message authentication to multireceiver and/or multisender scenarios. They provide efficient cryptographic authentication methods for point-to-multipoint communication, where a single sender can broadcast (multicast) only one unconditionally secure authenticator for a message and which all receivers can verify. They further develop multipoint-to-point communication (incast) in which any subset (of a specified size) of a group of individuals can transmit a single authenticator (or a signature) for a message using the group's key. This method has been called threshold authentication. It is an application layer that is transparent to the receiver which only deals with the group as one entity. The bandwidth, computations, and storage overheads are reduced substantially when compared with the traditional approach. Threshold authentication hides some aspects of the internal structure of the group, which may be important in interenterprise communication.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Broadcast protocols are closely linked with point-to-point shortest routing in computer networks, and for broadcasting certain identified information, such as topological changes across the network. Multi-address messages entail high overheads. Reliable and efficient broadcasts are required to properly utilize the network bandwidth and ensure that users update the identified important information. It is assumed that local topological information in terms of connectivity is available at the nodes. This relative relationship is used predictively to reduce redundant transmissions in the broadcast of messages across the network; a simulation study shows the reduction to be significant. Furthermore, for regular topologies, the redundancy in transmission can be shown to be zero. In conjunction with appropriate selectivity of information to the broadcast, an efficient and reliable broadcast is obtained. This work is relevant to networks with frequently changing topology in packet radio, cellular telephone, and strategic networks.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors propose a novel method for test sequence generation based on UIOS which only needs a minimal verification part.

The UIOv method can find a test sequence for any minimal finite-state machine. The proposed method has the same applicability as the UIOv method. In addition, the method uses a simple test on a given protocol specification to decide whether a verification part is needed for detecting transfer faults, the method can generate a minimal number of input/output sequences for a verification part. A more efficient algorithm for generating UIOSs and signature sets is presented. It is proven that the upper bound on the length of a UIOS is (n-1)*n rather than n/sup n/, where n is the number of states in a finite-state machine.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors propose two multicast routing algorithms which distribute copy operation of packets over all nodes along the multicast path: a link-added type algorithm and a loop-constructed type algorithm. Both algorithms, at first, derive an approximate solution for minimum cast path, and then improve the solution to prevent concentration of packet copy operation at one switching node at a little sacrifice of total cost along the path. Computer simulation results show that too much copy operation per node can be avoided by these algorithms. Compared to the minimum cost solution of the tree-shaped multicast path, the solution of the proposed algorithms makes the average distance connecting a source-destination pair longer, but the sacrifice of total cost is verb small. These algorithms can be applied not only to packet networks but also asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A protocol for setting up a tree connection for the purpose of multicast communication over a high-speed packet switched network is presented. The tree connection is based on the use of local identifiers, which are swapped at every intermediate node of the tree. Local identifiers are simple to manage, provide fast access to the routing tables, and are very efficient in terms of the size of the resulting routing space. The authors consider a high-speed network in which the local label swapping on data messages is performed in hardware by the switching subsystem, while the connection set-up is done in software by the switch control subsystem. A reliable protocol for setting up the tree connection is presented, and its correctness is formally proved. The protocol ensures the integrity of the tree and when failures occur, it is gracefully degraded into a smaller tree.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A wavelength division multiaccess network with buffer sharing among stations is studied. All stations in the network are connected to a passive optical star coupler and each station has a different fixed wavelength laser for transmitting packets. Each station in the network reports its packet backlog to a scheduler which computes and then broadcasts a transmission schedule to all the stations through a control channel in each time slot. A transmission schedule includes two types of assignments: (1) to assign a maximum number of stations for conflict-free transmissions, and (2) to assign to relocation of packets from congested stations to uncongested relaying stations through idling transceivers for distributed buffer sharing. The major benefit is the reduction of packet loss due to buffer overflow. Results show that as much as 75% of the buffers can be saved with buffer sharing.<<ETX>>},

Using spectral decomposition method and asymptotic analysis, it is shown that for fixed source average utilization and peak rate, as the burst size of the individual sources increase the tail behavior of the distribution of the number of cells queued in the multiplexer has a simple characterization. This characterization provides a simple approximation of the queuing behavior of the multiplexer, where the impact of each source is quite evident. The accuracy of this approximation is examined.

abstract={The authors present a performance study of the Gauss asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch with respect to cell loss. The Gauss switch is a recently proposed, high-performance, output buffered ATM switch that can easily be implemented. In general, if an ATM switch suffers from cell loss, the exact behavior of this cell loss as a function of parameters such as load, traffic business, internal speed, etc., has to be known. The study focuses on cell loss in the Gauss switch due to its reduced internal speed. Analytical results for the cell loss probability are provided and compared to corresponding quantities for the well-known knockout switch. The comparison shows that the Gauss switch yields significantly smaller cell loss probabilities than the knockout switch.<<ETX>>},

abstract={In order to utilize multiple-pass routing schemes, a faulty banyan network must possess the dynamic full access (DFA) property. The authors determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a banyan network to possess the DFA property and design a general testing procedure based on the condition. They also enumerate the probability that a banyan network loses the DFA property, given the number of faulty switch elements. It is found that, as long as faults do not occur in switch elements located in the first and last stages, this probability is very small even when there are quite a few faulty switch elements. Therefore, multiple-pass routing schemes can be very useful if the switch elements in the first and last stages are well protected.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) packet switch should be capable of handling delay sensitive as well as loss sensitive traffic. The authors consider delinking handling of these two types of priorities in a switching system, and present an analysis of two classes of delay sensitive traffic in an N*N nonblocking switch with input queues. In such a switch, two variations of nonpreemptive priority are studied. A packet switch with input buffers has inadequate throughput. To enhance the performance and to provide low delay to high priority traffic, a dual plane switch architecture is examined, where each plane is a nonblocking switch with input buffers. The two planes are connected in parallel to form a load sharing arrangement. The analysis of a single plane nonblocking switch is extended to this architecture. In both cases, the performance is compared with the simulation results of a 64*64 switch.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors describe a model for the performance evaluation of the Shuffleout asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch under arbitrary nonuniform traffic patterns. Shuffleout is a blocking multistage structure using shortest path routing with deflection, in which output queues are connected to all the stages. The analytical model developed computes the load on each interstage link by tracing all the paths that a packet can follow to reach the addressed switch outlet, that is, by taking into account all the deflections from its shortest path it can receive. Such a model allows the computation not only of the average load per stage but also its distribution over the different links belonging to the interstage pattern. Thus fairness in packet switching by Shuffleout is provided by the model.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new nonblocking copy network is presented, for use in an ATM switch supporting BISDN, with a shared-memory input buffer. Blocked cells from any switch input are stored in a single shared input buffer. The copy network consists of three Omega networks and shared-memory queues. The design is scalable for large numbers of inputs due to a low hardware complexity, O(N log/sub 2/ N), and distributed operation and control. It is shown by simulation results that a switch incorporating the shared-memory copy network has increased throughput and lower buffer requirements to maintain low packet loss probability when compared to a switch with a discrete buffer copy network.<<ETX>>},

pages={743-752 vol.2},
abstract={High performance in advanced packet switches can be achieved by providing queuing both at the input and the output ports. The author studies the performance of this class of switches under nonuniform traffic. Two different output queuing arrangements are considered, namely, the case where dedicated queues are provided at each output port, and the case where the output queuing space is shared among all the output ports. An analytical approach is presented for the performance study of these two schemes in the case of operation with fixed-size packets and under various degrees of traffic imbalance at the inputs or the outputs. The measures investigated include the average delay, the maximum throughput of the switch in the case of output traffic imbalance, and the saturation load in the case of input traffic imbalance. Analytical results for these measures are derived for the case of a switch with a large number of input and output ports. Numerical results for the maximum throughput and the saturation load are presented. It is demonstrated that the scheme of output sharing performs better than the scheme of dedicated output queuing.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors address peak rate enforcement in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks by pick-up policing mechanisms. Since the network cannot rely on user's compliance when declaring his traffic parameters, the policing function has been introduced to monitor the traffic characteristics of any connection. Policing mechanisms proposed in the literature are actually pick-up mechanisms since cells can pass transparently through unless a policing action was performed according to some counting process. The authors analyze the impact of the cell multiplexing jitter on policing mechanism dimensioning. Recognizing that dimensioning is a critical point for such mechanisms. It is shown that network buffer overflow cannot be avoided in certain conditions. Therefore, a new policing scheme, called cell spacing, is introduced, and two spacing algorithms are presented.<<ETX>>},

The behavior of the modified policing mechanisms is discussed. This new behavior is illustrated by using the generalized leaky bucket to police the mean rate of a source. Analysis using an on/off input process shows that the modified versions detect smaller-magnitude abuses, police the sources closer to their declared resources utilization, and have a faster response time. Results are presented showing that the generalized sliding window exhibits the same kind of behavior.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present a scheme for smoothing delay-sensitive traffic offered to an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network. They outline such a smoothing scheme, which, when applied to variable bit rate (VBR) coded video traffic, is both optimal and avoids violation of delay constraints. The scheme is based on the assumption that recent behavior of the traffic stream can be used to predict the behavior of the input stream in the near future. The effectiveness of the scheme was evaluated by simulation. The conclusion is that even with a rudimentary forecasting rule, smoothing can lower cell losses and increase the effectiveness of VBR schemes for video transmission.<<ETX>>},

Fairness is achieved by adding a banyan network to perform cyclic shifts in front of the copy network. A pipelined architecture is proposed to avoid a huge internal speed-up. The clock rate requirement of the proposed copy network is evaluated and compared with that of the original design. It is found that the clock rate requirement can be reduced significantly if the number of inlets is larger than 64.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A generic flow control (GFC) protocol is proposed to regulate multiple terminals within the broadband-ISDN customer premises network. The GFC protocol is based on multipriority distributed queuing preceded by a traffic shaping function, and meets the requirements for flexible allocation of service parameters, control of jitter and guarantee of bandwidth. This GFC protocol provides the necessary flexibility to match the constant bit rate (CBR) jitter performance and variable bit rate (VBR) service requirements to the particular service type. It integrates well with usage parameter control without imposing excessive burstiness on each virtual connection cell stream delivered to the network. By allowing connectionless users to access at the lowest priority, only when no higher priority users are queued, there is no reduction in guaranteed capacity available for other VBR and CBR users.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors propose a new policy to prevent congestion phenomena in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. In particular, using a synthesis approach, they define and calculate the bandwidth which is assigned to every acceptable source from the ATM network. This bandwidth, which varies between the peak and the average bandwidth demands of the particular source, is called effective or virtual, and is mainly characterized from the burstiness of the source. In constant bit rate sources the effective bandwidth is equal to the peak rate. Based on the concept of effective bandwidth, a connection acceptance algorithm that leads to a very high utilization of network resources is formulated.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The problem of allocating network resources to the users of an integrated services network is investigated in the context of rate based flow control. The authors propose the use of a packet service discipline at the nodes of the network that is based on a multiplex scheme called generalized processor sharing (GPS). This service discipline is combined with leaky bucket rate admission control to provide flexible, efficient and fair use of the links. A single server GPS system is analyzed exactly, and tight bounds on worst case packet delay, output burstiness and backlog are derived for each session, when the sources are constrained by leaky buckets. The analysis yields a simple resource assignment scheme that allows the server to make worst case delay and rate guarantees to every session in the system. Extensions of this work to arbitrary topology networks are also discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A connection-oriented congestion control protocol for broadband ISDN is presented. The protocol employs the traffic viewpoint hierarchical design approach and is implemented by a two-layer scheme at the call and cell layers. The call layer handles call admission and provides shortest path connection routing when a call is admitted, while the cell layer allocates switch input buffer space for each traffic type according to each type's cell loss probability grade-of-service requirement. There is a direct interaction between the two layers in processing a connection request. A discrete-time queuing system with geometrically distributed service time and state-dependent Markov modulated Bernoulli process arrivals is established to model heterogeneous networking environments for this protocol. An analytical solution is developed for this queuing system. Numerical results show that the protocol can reduce network congestion as input traffic rates approach switch capacity, and increase network utilization relative to that possible in the absence of congestion control.<<ETX>>},

The reliability model is based on information in the standards, plus implementation details, and is more realistic than previous models. Although the analysis is approximate, it includes all factors thought to be important in determining reliability, since an approximate analysis which included all such factors was felt to be more useful than an exact analysis which ignored important factors. The precise reliability measure analyzed is availability of a connection from a specified source to a specified destination. Although the use of an active communications medium instead of a passive bus may decrease reliability of the token ring, the architecture gives great flexibility in bypassing or otherwise recovering from faults. For large networks this adds considerably to the reliability. If many devices are inactive, however, this advantage can be eliminated by even a small probability that inactive devices are not successfully bypassed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Continuity of service and bounded and known message delivery latency are requirements of a number of applications, which are imperfectly fulfilled by standard LANs. Most previous studies have addressed this issue by computing worst-case access/transmission delays only for normal LAN operation. However, LANs are subject to failures, namely partitions. Since most applications can live with temporary glitches in LAN operation, an alternative approach is to quantify all these glitches or temporary partitions, called inaccessibilities, and to derive a worst-case figure, to be added to the worst-case transmission delay in the absence of faults. In these conditions, reliable real-time operation is possible on nonreplicated LANs. An exhaustive study of the inaccessibility characteristics of the ISO 8802/4 token-bus LAN is described.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors compare three strategies, namely, reservation, on-the-fly, and hybrid, for the support of connectionless internet traffic on asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). The comparison is based on a simulation experiment in which a mix of virtual paths (some carrying connectionless traffic, some carrying connection-oriented traffic) are multiplexed on a 150 Mb/s trunk, called the bottleneck trunk. Results based on a variety of measures (cell and burst loss rates, cell delay, and burst delay) show that the on-the-fly approach, which aggressively exploits unused bandwidth, is superior to the reservation scheme, which is handicapped by the renegotiation overhead and the conservative usage of bandwidth. The hybrid scheme exhibits a performance behavior between the other two. This is a bit disappointing, considering the fact that the hybrid scheme is expected to be consistently better than both schemes. Still the hybrid scheme offers some interesting features (e.g. lower delays for the background traffic) which should be further explored by a more extensive examination of the working parameters.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Algorithms for the group testing problem when there is no a priori information on the number of defective items are considered. The efficiency criterion used in the competitive ratio, which is the ratio of the number of tests required by an algorithm when there is no a priori information on the number of defective items, to the number of tests required by an optimal algorithm when the number of defective items is known in advance. A new algorithm is presented, and it is shown that the competitive ratio of this algorithm is 2. This result is an improvement over an algorithm given by D.Z. Du et al. (1991), for which the competitive ratio was 2.75. It also proves a conjecture made by them. A new application of group testing techniques for high-speed networks is discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors study packet loss in high speed networks interconnecting conventional local area networks (LANs). They consider two different techniques to control contention at the station where packets leave the high speed network and must wait for service by the LAN. One technique is based on a backoff strategy where packet transmission to a temporary overloaded station is interrupted for a randomly chosen time. The other technique studied uses rate-based flow control. A discussion of results for both fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) and distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) shows protocol-specific peculiarities requiring different solutions to different problems. Packet loss characteristics obtained for FDDI and DQDB are very close to each other.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors discuss problems related to the bridging method between the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)-based high-speed multimedia backbone local area network (MBLAN) and a fiber distributed data interface (FDDI), especially the filtering database (FDB) construction method for filtering of frames. The problems are achieving high performance, correspondence to a large-scale system, and prevention of broadcast. The FDB construction method was evaluated based on these problems. Through the evaluation, it was noted that the FDB learning failure rate must be below 10/sup -3/ and a frame filtering process when relaying frames from the MBLAN to an FDDI is not necessary. An FDB access method is proposed. By using a multiple hashing algorithm for the FDB access, the proposed method makes it possible to deal with all terminal addresses, even in a large-scale network system that includes tens of thousands of terminals or more, and also enables high-speed filtering/forwarding of frames between terminals. Both the entry search speed and an effective number of entries in the entry table can be adapted to the requirements of an application by changing the maximum number of hashing times.<<ETX>>},

They perform the delay analyses for these token-passing network standards when all the network traffic is of the highest priority class. They model them in an unified manner as a cyclic-service system with exhaustive time-limited service policies. They have specifically considered two variants of the time-limited service policies-nonpreemptive and look-ahead. The former models the token-bus and the latter models the token-ring and FDDI. The major result is an algorithm to approximate the mean delays for the nonpreemptive policy. Numerical results show that the algorithm is reasonably accurate for deterministic and exponential frame sizes. The algorithm is applied to the performance analysis of a token-bus. A similar approach for the look-ahead policy is outlined.<<ETX>>},

pages={2306-2314 vol.3},
abstract={The performance of a polling system is modeled by stochastic Petri nets and its analysis is done by numerically solving the underlying Markov chain. One key problem in using stochastic Petri nets for real applications is that the size of underlying Markov chain tends to be large, and thus to be computationally intractable. In order to carry out the performance analysis of a large complex system in practice, the authors develop approximation methods at the Petri net level for the finite population, asymmetric polling systems and analyze the error due to the approximation. The mean cycle time and the mean response time of the system are approximated by the folding method and by the fixed-point iteration method. The effect of an increasing number of customers on the polling systems is studied using these approximations. The approximation methods are shown to save more than 95% of computation cost without a concomitant loss in accuracy. The methods perform very well at low offered loads.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The current internet is based on a stateless (datagram) architecture. However, many recent proposals rely on the maintenance of state information within network routers, leading to the authors' interest in the implications of a stateful network layer. They collected internetwork traffic traces at the border routers of stub and transit networks, and used these data to evaluate, or predict, the effects of design alternatives for stateful architectures. They present an estimate of the number of active conversations at a router, and from this derive the storage requirements for the associated conversation state table. The analysis shows that, at the network periphery, fine-grain control over the traffic may be possible. However, deeper within the network, it may be more efficient to manage the conversations at a coarser level. The network traffic traces are used to perform trace driven simulations of an LRU cache, for different conversation granularities. Results show that locality exists for each of the conversation types investigated.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The single-path selective-broadcast interconnection (SBI) is a static, passive interconnection among a set of stations, each equipped with multiple c transmitters and receivers. It uses c/sup 2/ buses, each interconnecting a subset of the stations, and provides a single common bus to any two stations. The author explores those merits of this SBI which are related directly to its implementation in fiber optics. When compared with c buses, each interconnecting all stations, the SBI is shown to offer substantial advantages in power budget and the maximum number of stations that can be interconnected without repeaters or amplifiers. It is also attractive in terms of the required passive fiber optic components such as fiber segments and star couplers. For a fixed power budget and direct detection, the capacity of this SBI is shown to be highest among bus-oriented single-hop interconnections for both a uniform traffic pattern and the worst-case unknown skew.<<ETX>>},

year={1992},
volume={},

pages={2368-2377 vol.3},
abstract={The authors examine the behavior of a source subject to flow control by a credit manager. The source receives packets for transmission into a high speed network according to a renewal process. The credit manager regulates the flow of data into the network by the following method. First, credit is generated at a fixed rate and is allowed to accumulate, subject to an upper bound. Second, a packet is allowed to start transmission only if the accumulated credit is at least and as large as the service time of the packet. Otherwise, the packet waits until the required amount of credit has been accumulated. Third, the credit bank is depleted at the onset of service by an amount which equals the service time. The main purpose of the credit manager is to smooth out the burstiness of the input process, thereby making it easier for the network to handle large amounts of data without undue delays, congestion, or buffer overflows. Despite the difficulty of this problem, the distributions of queue length and sojourn time are found by assuming a special structure for the service time distribution and the credit bank. Numerical examples show that the algorithms can be used to solve practical problems.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors describe the implementation of the binary feedback congestion avoidance (CA) policies and report measurements of the CA scheme in an OSI testbed at MITRE. The goal is to experiment with network configurations and traffic loads varied and complex enough to allow realistic performance evaluation of CA. These measurement experiments present evidence that the congestion avoidance policy operates effectively with a variety of traffic loads and configurations. The conditions used for the measurement experiments with CA include the coexistence of traffic participating in the CA scheme with intermittent traffic that does not participate in CA; and use of CA with realistic traffic such as bulk data file transfer type traffic and remote login traffic. These results show that there is a dramatic reduction in the mean and standard deviation of the response time as well as the number of retransmissions for all classes of traffic, even when some of the sources of traffic do not participate in the CA policy. The behavior of the CA policies with bidirectional traffic was also studied.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors consider a flow control mechanism that dynamically regulates the rate of data flow into a network based on feedback information about the network state. Such mechanisms have been introduced in a variety of networks, and have been advocated for future high-speed networks. The authors first model the flow control mechanism by a discrete-space stochastic process and define appropriate performance measures for transient and steady-state regimes. However, the model does not appear to be analytically tractable, and the authors study it through simulation. They then simplify it to a continuous-space deterministic (or fluid) model for which closed-form solutions can be derived easily. It is found that the analytical results for the fluid model agree well with the simulation results obtained using the discrete-space model. Both models explicitly consider delay of the feedback information, thus making them relevant for high-speed networks.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A thorough investigation of the performance of the rotating slot generator (RSG) scheme, based on simulation, is presented. RSG is a medium access control protocol appropriate for high-capacity long-distance metropolitan area networks (MANs). It uses the looped bus architecture of the distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) in which the slot generators for both busses are colocated inside the same station. However in RSG, all the stations, one after the other in a cyclic order, undertake the task of generating and destroying the slots on both busses. In this way the location of the station relative to the slot generator changes dynamically, and its effect on the performance is drastically reduced. The authors investigate the fairness and performance of RSG under symmetric and asymmetric loading, underload and overload conditions, and under the presence of a single or multiple priority classes of traffic. They also compare its performance with different variations of DQDB.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The capabilities of the cyclic reservation multiple access (CRMA) protocol for supporting mixed video and data traffic was evaluated by computer simulation. The results show that in order to obtain good performance and fairness between all the mixed stations, they should have similar requirements in terms of the number of slots that are requested at each reservation cycle. It is therefore important to reduce the variability by aggregating more slots for stations with short packets, and by transmitting long frames in successive cycles for long packets. The optimal selection of the low and high bound on the number of slots can significantly improve the performance of the CRMA network under mixed traffic conditions.<<ETX>>},

Using the model they studied the performance of a video multiplexer that multiplexes several full motion video sources. The video sources were assumed to use a layered coding technique. A service strategy is proposed that guarantees delivery of packets marked essential, whereas nonessential packets may be dropped in the event of congestion. The study showed that with layered coding, good tail probabilities can be obtained for a given number of sources at the expense of some loss for nonessential packets. The performance of the video multiplexer was investigated when the video sources were correlated, and when independent video sources with different thresholds for essential packet rate were multiplexed together.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors propose an efficient, fair, and simple capacity-1 protocol that outperforms both fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) and distributed queue dual bus (DQDB). In the recent years, two network protocols gained predominance in very fast local and in metropolitan area networks: FDDI (using a single or dual ring) and DQDB (using a dual bus). The authors propose a network topology that is very similar to the dual ring of FDDI and a token-passing protocol suitable for this topology. Their solution yields a true capacity-1 network with zero access delay under light load. Moreover, it naturally accommodates synchronous traffic and is absolutely fair. The proposed protocol has a much better performance than FDDI; it also outperforms DQDB for sufficiently fast (or long) networks.<<ETX>>},

title={The token grid: multidimensional media access for local and metropolitan networks},
year={1992},
volume={},
number={},
pages={2415-2424 vol.3},
abstract={A token grid network in which media access is performed over a two-dimensional mesh is introduced. In the resulting system, each station is two-connected and has the same transmission hardware and small station latency as in a dual token ring. In the token grid, however, the total system throughput may be many factors larger than that which is possible in a dual token ring. This advantage increases with the normalized end-to-end propagation delay. In the results presented, the uniform load capacity of the token grid grows with the size of the network. In addition, the token grid can take advantage of communities-of-interest amongst the stations. It is possible to implement the system in such a way as to achieve robust operation in the presence of station and link failures.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The performance evaluation of multistage self-routing interconnection networks for asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching is carried out by means of an analytical approach. The switching elements in the interconnection network are provided with a buffer shared among all the inlets and outlets of the element and no backpressure signals are exchanged between adjacent stages. Two analytical models are considered: the scalar model and the vectorial model. In the former case the addresses of the packets in the same buffer are assumed to be mutually independent, whereas in the latter case the model keeps memory of the addresses of the packets stored in the buffer across consecutive time slots. The vectorial model provides performance measures much more accurate than the scalar model.<<ETX>>},

The decomposition of the queuing process into a cell scale and a burst scale component is illustrated.

volume={},

pages={503-507 vol.2},
abstract={A novel state-space approach is used to characterize the overload cycle behavior of a generalized bandwidth balancing (BWB) scheme for the distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) multiple access procedure. The author exploits the fact that each node and the bus can be modeled by a finite state machine and will have cycles in the state diagram. The cycles of interest are referred to as overload cycles and result when one or more nodes are simultaneously trying to access the bus as quickly as possible. The author determines the overload cycle invariants imposed by BWB and generalizes BWB to be any integral relationship between used and skipped empty segments. It is shown that the ordinary access-based priorities cannot work, without some additional cycle invariants, in a system employing bandwidth balancing since it is impossible to preclude service to an upstream low priority mode and generalized BWB is suggested as an alternative method for obtaining rate-based priority grades of service.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) standard is studied under heavy load conditions. The DQDB protocol for asynchronous traffic is reviewed. The network model and analysis are presented when there are two active nodes. Analytic expressions are derived for the steady-state nodal throughputs and the average value of the request counters of inactive nodes. The three-station case is considered by providing an accurate approximation for the situation when the third node is in between the two initially active nodes. Simulation results are given for comparison. The effect of the position of a node was studied via simulation in the three-station case. The case when one of the active nodes becomes inactive in a network with three initially active nodes is analyzed. The state the network assumes is studied in terms of nodal throughputs after one of the nodes turns off, and the impact on the request counters of the inactive nodes are investigated.<<ETX>>},

year={1992},
volume={},

pages={518-526 vol.2},
abstract={The authors present a novel approach to distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) modeling. The innovative aspect lies in the representation of the slot-occupancy-pattern process on the forward bus. In the literature, this process has been modeled as a Bernoulli process, implying that the status (empty/busy) of consecutive slots is independent. Results presented, however, show that even at light loads the interdependence between slots is significant. The model captures some of this interdependence by using a discrete-time first-order Markov process for the slot-occupancy-pattern process on the forward bus. A simplified DQDB network is identified for which a closed formula is derived for the joint probability density function for the slot occupancy pattern of two consecutive slots. The accuracy of the results was investigated with simulation.<<ETX>>},

pages={527-535 vol.2},
abstract={The analytical evaluation of the message delay in a distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) network is investigated. The authors extend the results obtained by C. Bisdikian et al. (1990), which assumes that each network station can queue at most one packet, to the case of station queues each holding an entire message containing l packets. An expression is obtained for the number of requests queued ahead of an arriving message. Given this expression, the average message delay can be calculated. One conclusion drawn from the analysis is that the average steady-state message delay is linear in sufficiently large l. It is also concluded that the message delay increases considerably with the network load. The analytical results predict the position-dependent characteristics of stations in a heavily loaded network and explain some observations and results of earlier simulation studies.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A state-dependent call admission and routing policy for a multiservice circuit-switched network is analyzed. The policy is based on decomposition of the Markov decision problem into a set of separable link problems. To provide an exact link analysis model a value iteration algorithm was offered. This allows examination of the accuracy of several approximations used to reduce the complexity of the problem. The numeral study showed that the convergence of the analyzed strategy is achieved in at most two iterations. The study also showed the good traffic efficiency of the approach and confirmed the predicted ability to control the distribution of call classes grade of service. The approach, together with its sensitivity analysis with respect to the arrival rates, provides a very general framework for studying, constructing, and optimizing other call admission and routing strategies. The results of sensitivity analysis are used to compare the proposed decomposition approach with the decomposition approach developed by F.P. Kelly (1988) for optimization of a load sharing policy. Also, the relationship to other routing strategies based on Markov decision theory is investigated.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors address the problem of optimal routing in packet switched networks. Optimality is discussed in terms of end-to-end delay. The variance of delay as well as its mean value are taken into account. Achieving optimal routing is necessary for multimedia networks to fully support real-time services. A network is modeled as a weighted graph with its link weights representing link delays. It is assumed that the delay statistics conform to a normal distribution. In the course of analysis, it is shown that this type of routing optimization problem can be formulated as a process of searching for a specific point in a coordinate system defined by the mean and variance of the end-to-end delay. An efficient algorithm is presented for finding the optimal point in this coordinate system.<<ETX>>},

Transmission of requests in the controlled request DQDB method is controlled by a mechanism that is similar to the one used in DQDB to transmit segments. Fairness is achieved by using the bandwidth balancing technique to prevent an overloaded node form continuously transmitting requests. Simulation studies showed that the controlled request DQDB scheme achieves better performance than the DQDB protocol with bandwidth balancing.<<ETX>>},

An access control scheme is proposed as a solution. A comparison of the proposed scheme with the 802.6 protocol is presented.

abstract={A new protocol, fair distributed queue (FDQ), suitable for very high speed metropolitan area networks (MANs), is presented. FDQ is a slotted system implemented on a unidirectional fiber bus. It has similarities to the distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) protocol. FDQ achieves full throughput efficiency independent of the bus length, the transmission speed, and the number of nodes. FDQ allocates equal bandwidth under heavy load to all active users in a time period less than or equal to the round-trip propagation delay without wasting bandwidth. Its delay characteristics were studied via simulation and compared to DQDB. FDQ has lower average delays under a Poisson load than the DQDB protocol with or without the bandwidth balancing mechanism. The implementation of priority levels and detailed timing structure of the protocol are also described. It was shown that FDQ's delay and throughput characteristics were only slightly affected by increasing distances or the number of nodes.<<ETX>>},

They focus on Markov modulated arrival processes with different burstings and investigate the loss of individual arrival streams when the parameters of the heterogeneous arrival streams are varied. The analysis includes both continuous-time and discrete-time treatments of multiplexed heterogeneous Markov modulated arrivals. Loss probabilities are derived for a priority packet discarding scheme. A new characterization of an arrival stream is introduced, referred to as a self-loss, and it is used to qualitatively predict the effects of multiplexing bursty streams with nonbursty streams. The effectiveness of priority packet discarding is also investigated through numerical examples.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Error control problems arising in the broadband ISDN environment are analyzed. The first problem relates to end-to-end integrity. The second problem is related to synchronization. The third problem is the performance of the cell-based cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in the presence of a self-synchronous scrambler to avoid attacks by malicious users. However, the scrambler creates error multiplication whereby a single error on the physical link is translated into two errors in the cell exactly 43 bits apart. In this context, it is proved that the cell-based CRC is capable of correcting correlated double errors produced by the self-asynchronous scrambler. The last problem studied is parallel implementation of CRC coders and decoders.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The performance of the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) under overload is studied. It is well known that, under overload, FDDI can settle into one of many recurrent sets of states. The idea of desirable and undesirable states is introduced. A desirable state is one where users share the capacity more or less equally in each token rotation. It is shown that the response times of interactive users are adversely affected if the system operates in an undesirable set of states. The waiting time of heavy users can be reduced by forcing the system to settle into the desirable states. Simple control mechanisms are proposed to ensure that the system settle into the desirable states.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present a reliable double-ring metropolitan area network architecture, called DORFMAN, based on an enhanced Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) protocol. DORFMAN is composed of two local ring networks interconnected via two monitors. The two monitors are used to perform simple routing and error recovery logic as well as mode transitions of DORFMAN. There are three modes defined in DORFMAN: local, global, and transition modes. During the local mode, DORFMAN allows double rings to operate in parallel. During the global mode, DORFMAN behaves as an FDDI network. Modes are dynamically switched between local and global modes on a demand basis. The bandwidth waste resulting from the transition of modes has been reduced to a minimum. Performance analysis and simulation results show that with a reasonable degree of locality assumed, twice the throughput of an FDDI network can be achieved in DORFMAN. An error recovery scheme for DORFMAN is addressed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors introduce a control strategy for bandwidth management in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. A two-level hierarchy is defined, where one level performs fixed class-selective call admission control strategies that are periodically dynamically coordinated by a higher-level bandwidth allocation controller. Each admission controller decides to accept or refuse an incoming call on the basis of a class-selective rule designed to maintain a certain quality of service. A decision is taken according to the virtual capacity share that is assigned to the various service classes by the allocation controller. Bandwidth shares are periodically recomputed online by means of the constrained minimization of a cost function that takes cell loss probability and refused traffic into account. The control structure, the strategies, and the optimization algorithm used are described as well as the assumptions underlying the choices made. Initial simulation results are reported.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors propose a new scheme for optical signal routing within linear lightwave network (LLN) subnets. They study the synchronization problem that exists in these subnets which prevents efficient implementation of time division multiple access schemes for sharing a common broadcast medium. A solution for this problem is proposed, based on a new optical agent signal routing scheme, called rooted routing. The impact of the rooted routing on power losses is analyzed, and an approach for optimizing the power losses in LLNs with rooted routing is presented. It is shown that when the link and excess losses are small, the optimal power budget is close to that when the original, shortest path routing scheme is used. It is also shown that the power budget in LLNs with rooted routing can be significantly improved using a single optical amplifier.<<ETX>>},

As a logical overlay which serves to route information packets between stations, a form of perfect shuffle, the ShuffleNet, is used. Performance is calculated in terms of average packet delay as a function of traffic load. Of particular interest is the effect of physical limitations on performance. In particular, the effect of a limitation on the bandwidth of optical amplifiers is delineated. This limitation increases the length of the path between originating and terminating stations.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors develop a model for characterizing the behavior of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) buffer when it is carrying variable-bit-rate video traffic. Traffic smoothing on a frame-by-frame basis allows the modeling of video sources as randomly modulated Poisson processes which are characterized by their bit rate histograms. An M/D/1/N approximation is used to accurately predict results such as buffer occupancy distributions and cell loss rates. Given the bit rate histograms of several individual video sources, a histogram for the aggregate arrival process can be found and the system behavior can be predicted. A new call admission control scheme and policing algorithm are developed based on the model. They can be used to prevent congestion in the network and to protect calls that adhere to parameters given at call setup.<<ETX>>},

In contrast to previous results, the technique yields a throughput improvement from 65% to 92% without speedup, trunking, or complicated hardware. If input grouping with a group size of four is also employed, then the method can yield up to 95% throughput.<<ETX>>},

Some basic issues in such an arrangement are studied, such as the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal performance and the minimum number of modules required for the switch to have optimal performance while permitting sharing of the entire buffer space among all the input and output ports and while preserving packet sequencing for any virtual channel.

abstract={The author addresses the problem of selecting timer thresholds for the asynchronous priorities in a Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) system. Based on an approximate analysis for the throughput under overload, two methods are derived. The first one is designed to meet requirements for the ratios between throughputs of stations with different priorities, whereas the second method includes absolute throughput values. Additionally, a proposition for dimensioning the timer thresholds of traffic classes that are deferred under overload is presented. Some examples for the application of these methods to overload control in FDDI systems are given. The results indicate that FDDI's timed token protocol provides the possibility to guarantee bandwidth not only for synchronous traffic, but also for asynchronous traffic. The allocation of guaranteed bandwidth can be controlled easily by selecting the timer thresholds according to the rules derived.<<ETX>>},

The implementation of injection simulation for polling models of FDDI is discussed, along with simulation results.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new concept of spectral characterization of the wideband input process in high-speed networks is examined. The eigenstructure technique, through the modeling of input Markov chains, helps localize wideband sources in a subspace, especially in a low frequency band. Simple periodic chains are used for the construction of the input rate process. The input power spectral distribution is defined in a discrete frequency domain. Each input traffic stream is characterized by an independent Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP). The underlying Markov chain is used to reflect the time autocorrelation properties of the input process at a macro level. Expressions are derived for correlation and power spectral functions of the MMPP input. A queuing analysis with multiple periodic input functions is described. The queue response to input correlation functions is examined. The advantages of using the spectral domain to analyze and design network control and resource management are discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Previous work by the authors (See Proceedings Conf. on Information Sciences and Systems, Baltimore, USA, 1990) where the spectral decomposition method was used for the transient analysis of a single-server queue is generalized. For the arrival process a general discrete-time Markovian batch arrival process is assumed, where the batch size distribution of the arrivals in successive slots is governed by a N-state discrete-time Markov chain. It is shown that once the N eigenvalues of the probability generating matrix of the arrival process are obtained, the complete solution in the transform domain may be given. Using the complex analysis technique and Cauchy's integral formula, an efficient numerical method is presented for the calculation of a few performance measures. The numerical method is generalized to the situations where the superpositions of a number of independent arrival sources are fed to the queue. It is shown that the numerical complexity are fed to the queue. It is shown that the numerical complexity of obtaining the transient solution in this case can be substantially reduced by using an approach based on the Kronecker product.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors study the loss performance of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) multiplexer, whose input consists of the superposition of a multiplicity of heterogeneous on-off sources. The stochastic fluid flow approach yields the entire buffer occupancy probability distribution in terms of the solution of a linear differential equation system. The focus is on the numerical investigation of the steady-state behavior of models involving very large state spaces. A novel approximate technique is introduced allowing a dramatic reduction of the computational burden, so that the analysis of a large variety of traffic mixes becomes feasible. Many numerical results are presented to support the accuracy of the method. Applications of the analysis method are outlined.<<ETX>>},

pages={415-425 vol.1},
abstract={The authors give the complete solution for a stochastic fluid model of statistical multiplexing with loss priorities in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)-based broadband ISDN. In this model each Markov modulated fluid source generates priority and marked cell streams which are bursty, mutually correlated, and periodic during bursts. The output of many such sources is buffered and multiplexed for transmission. The loss priority is implemented by selectively discarding marked cells when the buffer content exceeds a threshold level. The equilibrium state distribution exhibits jumps, a feature not existent in prior fluid models. The computational complexity for two-state sources is dominated by a single system of linear equations of dimension equal to twice the number of sources, in particular, the complexity is independent of buffer size. The complete delay distribution for each traffic class is obtained. Numerical results are given. The analysis is generalized to several priority classes of traffic.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present a queuing analysis and a simulation study of banyan switch fabrics based on 2*2 switching elements with crosspoint buffering. In particular, the results apply to the PHOENIX switching element based banyan fabrics. The results indicate that crosspoint buffering provides throughput approaching the offered load under uniform traffic conditions. The effect of bursty traffic on the performance of the switch is studied. It is shown that a speedup factor of three or more is required to achieve acceptable delay and packet loss probability. It is also shown that the amount of buffer space required per port increases linearly with the burst size for a desired packet loss performance. For a given burst size the packet loss rate decreases exponentially as the buffer size is increased. The impact of crosspoint buffering and shared buffering in the switching elements on the performance of the banyan fabric is analyzed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present an analytical model of a buffered banyan asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch which allows complex switching elements, bursty traffic, and nonuniform destination distributions and permits the analysis of large-scale switches. The ATM switch is analyzed by decomposing it into individual switching elements. Each switching element is then analyzed numerically in isolation assuming that its arrival and service processes are known. The parameters of the arrival and service processes of the switching elements are obtained using an iterative scheme. The results obtained are approximate and validation tests have shown that they have good accuracy. Using this model, the cell loss, throughput, and the mean time to traverse the switch were obtained for different traffic parameters and buffer sizes within a switching element.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors propose a methodology for performing an evaluation and optimization of the cost of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching architecture under performance constraints given in terms of virtual connection blocking probability. An analysis of blocking networks is developed and combined with known results concerning nonblocking networks that provide a theoretical model which relates traffic characteristics, network topology, and blocking probability in a multirate/multiservice broadband environment. An analysis of the characteristics determining the cost of a generic ATM switch implementation follows. The model is oriented to optimize both the topological parameters and the speed advantage, with respect to the main cost factors of VLSI-based switching networks.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A method for modeling a spatial priority mechanism called the push-out buffer management policy is proposed.

pages={294-302 vol.1},
abstract={It is desirable to interconnect different computer hosts and local area networks (LANs) through the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network via broadband terminal adaptors (BTAs). The BTA must have a sufficiently large buffer, called a virtual channel queue (VCQ), to temporarily store multiple, partially received packets from different virtual channels. The buffer requirement of a shared-memory VCQ is studied for different packet loss probabilities and virtual channel numbers. Two different architectures for implementing the shared-memory VCQ are compared. The second architecture with multiple linked queues in the shared-memory requires less memory and has better scalability to accommodate a large number of virtual channels and is adopted in the analysis. Several possible error conditions, such as shared-memory overflow, the received packet exceeding its maximum length, and the corruption of the pointer in the logical queue, are discussed. Corresponding solutions are proposed in the VCQ designs.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present mechanisms for congestion control of data traffic in high-speed wide area networks. The network model assumes reservation of resources based on average requirements. The key ideas involve separation of different sources of network congestion, short-term bursts and medium-term load, and using separate mechanisms to address them. Thus, dynamic time window (DTW) admission control is proposed as a mechanism to limit traffic burstiness from sources as a function of the medium-term load on the system, while a new fairness criterion for short-term congestion (Pulse) is proposed as a mechanism for dealing with fair scheduling by switches of short-term bursts. The model of the network is presented. The DTW and Pulse mechanisms are discussed. A detailed analytical and simulation study is presented for static time-windows and various scheduling algorithms. Preliminary results on DTW are discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Optical routing control using a coherent optical pattern-matching circuit is described. This circuit can detect any specified pattern in an ultrafast optical signal sequence by using tapped delay-lines to optically correlate the input pattern with a set pattern. A whole 4-bit pattern-matching circuit was monolithically integrated on a silicon substrate by the silica-based planar lightwave circuit technology. The fabricated circuit operated at a bit rate of 4.65 Gb/s. Pattern-matching circuits can apply to optical routing control for photonic self-routing switches. Address-header formats for ring and banyan networks are also discussed from the point of view of the power penalty versus the number of addresses. The header for ring networks is composed of a binary code or a Gold code. The header for banyan networks is composed of code-division-multiplexed Gold codes. Optically routing-controlled photonic packet switching using headers composed of binary codes was experimentally demonstrated at a bit rate of 10 Gb/s.<<ETX>>},
