pages={1-8},
abstract={The authors propose an architecture that can switch hundreds of gigabits while meeting a wide variety of service requirements. The switch can be constructed out of a few atomic cell types with regular interconnection patterns. This simple structure lends itself to very effective VLSI implementation. The multicast packet switch consists of three internally nonblocking, self-routing subnetworks. First, the selector subnetwork arbitrates among competing demands for copies to satisfy real-time requirements. The copy subnetwork then makes the copies and the switch subnetwork routes the packet copies to their final destinations. The authors detail the architecture and operation of the multicast switch.<<ETX>>},

pages={9-18},
abstract={An architecture is described for a high-performance switching fabric that can accommodate circuit-switched and packet-switched traffic in a unified manner. The switch fabric is self-routing and uses fixed-length minipackets within the switching fabric for all types of connections. Its architecture provides full input/output connectivity paths with FIFO (first-in-first-out) queueing at each output. The connection paths are non-overlapping, so there is no internal blocking. Because of output queueing, there is also practically no output port blocking. The uniformity in architecture allows the construction of any size fabric from a single basic module which could be realized on a single chip. Larger-size configurations can be realized either as single-stage configuration.<<ETX>>},

number={},
pages={19-28},
abstract={An investigation is presented of the performance, for multiservice traffic, of a high-capacity, fast packet switch based on a nonbuffered, multistage interconnection network, implemented from identical LSI switching elements. It is shown that for an implementation operating at 30 Mb/s, switches with a total traffic capacity of up to 50 Gb/s can be constructed. If the voice class traffic load is limited on each switch port to a maximum of 80% of saturation, a maximum delay across the switch of on the order of 200 mu s can be guaranteed, for every voice-class connection, regardless of the total traffic load on the switch.<<ETX>>},

title={Multicast and broadcast services in a knockout packet switch},
year={1988},
volume={},
number={},
pages={29-34},
abstract={The knockout switch is a packet-switch architecture recently proposed for high-performance packet networks. In addition to providing point-to-point connections among user pairs, a packet network must often support multicast and broadcast capabilities. Multicast connections differ from point-to-point connections in that each packet is addressed to a number of destinations. Two specific approaches using the knockout switch to provide a practical and efficient means for multicast services under both light and heavy traffic conditions are proposed. The first involves packet duplication and is more suitable for light traffic loads. The second uses a fast address comparison technique and is capable of handling larger loads. In both cases, the knockout principle is utilized to yield the best delay-throughput performance, guarantee the first-in first-out packet sequence, and provide for a simple, modular implementation.<<ETX>>},

title={Path allocation access control in fiber optic communication systems},
year={1988},
volume={},
number={},
pages={35-44},
abstract={The authors consider a path-oriented channel allocation management. As opposed to multiaccess protocols of existing fiber-optic systems, in the proposed approach the outgoing channel of the source node and the incoming channel of the destination node are allocated time-sequentially, creating a time-dependent virtual path for all pairs of users. Using the time-oriented path allocation, the need for packet buffering at the central node is eliminated multiple channels can be utilized simultaneously for different transmissions, and packet delays are bounded. The authors demonstrate that the same approach is feasible for efficient control of multibeam satellite systems. They introduce a tractable analytic model for the evaluation of communication systems based on this approach. The model is used to evaluate the proposed system performance under different switching functionalities of the central node. In addition to providing the throughput/delay characteristics of the system, the model shows a relation between the degree of star symmetry and the system performance, with the equidistant node arrangement yielding the optimal performance.<<ETX>>},

pages={45-54},
abstract={An asynchronous high-speed fiber-optic local area network is described that supports ordinary data packet traffic simultaneously with synchronous TI voice traffic over a common FDDI (fiber-optic distributed data interface) token ring channel. A voice interface module was developed that parses, buffers, and resynchronizes the voice data to the packet network. The technique is general, however, and can be applied to any deterministic class of networks, including multitier backbones. A conventional single-token access protocol was used at the lowest layer, with fixed packet sizes for voice and variable for data. In addition, the higher-layer packet data protocols are allowed to operate independently of those for the voice, thereby permitting great flexibility in reconfiguring the network. Voice call setup and switching functions were performed external to the network with PABX equipment.<<ETX>>},

year={1988},
volume={},
number={},
pages={55-61},
abstract={The optical hypergraph is a novel network architecture in which each edge of the hypergraph is a multiple-access broadcast medium constructed as a passive optical star coupler. Access to each net (edge) is time-slotted, and the system maintains global slot synchronization. The integration of voice into the system is done by reserving time slots in a periodic manner. A packet which contains several voice parcels from different phone conversations is transferred in these slots. These parcels may have different destinations on the optical net. As a result of the global end-to-end synchronization, the delay from the source to the destination is a known constant, with accuracy of plus or minus half a time slot. In the analysis, it is shown that the system improves its operation as the communication bandwidth increases. In other words, the algorithms and protocols improve in performance as the communication bandwidth increases. Two criteria are used to exhibit this phenomenon: (i) the utilization efficiency and (ii) the end-to-end delay.<<ETX>>},

The network performance is determined as a function of the signaling parameters, number of active users, and their information rates. It is shown that the network throughput can be significantly increased if users allow a few bit errors per packet. Thus, users have the freedom of trading off throughput for bit error rate and vice-versa.<<ETX>>},

The ability of a test sequence to decide whether a protocol implementation conforms to its specification heavily relies upon the range of faults that it can capture. This study shows that a test sequence produced by T-method has a poor fault detection capability whereas test sequences produced by U-, D- and W-methods have fault coverage comparable to each other and superior to that for T-method on several classes of randomly generated machines used.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An approach to achieving integrated transmission of packet and circuit traffic is proposed. Starting with dynamic time-division multiplexing (DTDM), integrated multiplexing techniques based on block-level processing are described together with their design architecture. These multiplexing techniques allow the handling of both bursty traffic and continuous time-multiplexed signals through the same physical multiplexer, while maintaining a design complexity that is not greater than that of a conventional time division multiplexer. By incorporating these multiplexing techniques into the existing network, DTDM will provide a practical migration strategy from the existing predominantly circuit-switched network to a future broadband packet-switched network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A discussion is presented of the effects of this additional delay on speech transmission over a mixed packet and circuit connection. The authors find that the additional delay introduced by a packet network remains within acceptable bounds for normal conversation, and thus does not degrade the service quality. However, the additional delay can cause severe problems because of the presence of echoes if proper suppression measures are not incorporated. They argue that echoes can be reduced to acceptable limits by using echo cancellation devices at the gateways between the packet network and the circuit-switched network, with no changes required in the circuit-switched part of the network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The author studies maximum delay in buffered multistage interconnection networks. His model differs from most in its assumptions about the traffic entering the network. Instead of using a stochastic model for the entering traffic, it is assumed that the entering traffic is unknown but satisfies certain regularity constraints. In case these constraints would not otherwise be satisfied, it is possible to devise and analyze processing (and the associated delay) that can be performed so that the constraints are satisfied. The constraints considered are well suited for bounding parameters of interest. For example, bounds on maximum network delay for each user of the network are easily obtained. The methods presented can be applied to a wide variety of models for network operation and configuration.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Concurrent token ring (CTR), a multiple-access protocol for ring-type area networks, is proposed. In CTR, message frames are partially removed by the destination node. A truncated portion of the frame, which contains the source and destination addresses, is configured by the destination into a conditional token which is allowed to circulate back to the source for removal. The conditional token informs 'downstream' nodes of busy data paths and allows them to establish concurrent message transmission if resources are free. Simulation results indicate that the CTR protocol has a higher throughput and shorter transmission delay than the IEEE 802.5 token ring.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Random access scheduling schemes for broadcast-bus-type local area networks are considered. It is found that a good access scheduling scheme not only has information about the number of packets to be scheduled, but which, more importantly controls the average of this number, which can be achieved by properly choosing the scheduling interval. Furthermore, this scheduling interval is updated in such a way that adjacent intervals overlap, which by correlation gives a better estimate for the number of packets to be scheduled. The scheduling schemes developed using such concepts provide significant performance improvement over schemes using other scheduling approaches previously reported in the literature.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present analytical models to approximate average message queueing time, service time, and token round trip time on ring topology local area networks that use a Playthrough protocol. Playthrough's data-link-layer protocol uses a continually circulating control token, source removed update control messages, and destination-removed data messages to achieve concurrent transfer of multiple messages of arbitrary length. The models of data-message service time and token round trip time are used in a queueing system model for average message waiting time in this class of multiserver circuit-switched ring. The collection of analytical models is shown to adequately approximate simulated queueing times for messages transmitted using a shortest-outbound-distance-first queueing discipline. This analysis differs from earlier approximations in that it includes the effects of both bridge traffic and downstream blocking traffic on the waiting times experienced by messages arriving at an arbitrary node.<<ETX>>},

It is shown that some existing and proposed protocols can reach a livelocked state as a result of a single transmission error. Livelock-free modifications of the protocols are described. The protocols covered fall into two classes: those in which error recovery utilizes a unique monitor station, and those in which all stations in the ring follow the same algorithm (decentralized protocols). It is shown that although the simplest protocol in each class is susceptible to livelocks, there are some nonobvious differences between the two classes. The problem is outlined and the assumptions made are also presented. Protocols with a monitor station are studied along with decentralized protocols. An example is given of a livelock. Informal arguments are used to show that the modifications proposed are livelock-free.<<ETX>>},

The analysis of downline-load protocol performance is given from the point of view of the time required to downline load a large number of devices. The authors also examine the impact of the total traffic generated by downline loading. Two downline-loading algorithms are studied and their performance characteristics compared.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A media access technique called MICON (Migratory Connection-Based Media Access) is presented for broadband local and metropolitan area networks. In the technique proposed, CSMA/CD (carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection) is combined with a dynamic channel assignment scheme applied to multichannel network architectures. By virtue of a controlled migration of users the channel selection scheme achieves dynamic load balancing in connection environments. The 1-persistent mode of MICON is presented. An analytic model is developed by incorporating an extension of S.S. Lam's (1980) assumption for single-channel CSMA/CD to the multichannel case. The throughput-delay performance predicted by the model is found to be in close agreement with the results obtained by simulating MICON for single-connection environments.<<ETX>>},

pages={244-253},
abstract={A tree metropolitan area network (MAN) is proposed that is based on a broadband cable, enabling bandwidth to be dynamically allocated between groups of stations in an integrated voice/data/video system. The stations are grouped into local area networks (LANs) according to the particular applications involved and also to their distance one from the other. A first goal of the proposed network is to enable intra-LAN and inter-LAN traffic to operate concurrently while each LAN remains independent. The cable bandwidth is frequency-divided into intra-LAN and inter-LAN bands, together with two control bands. Another important goal of the proposed network is that each LAN should be able to acquire and/or free more bandwidth than when the band is statically divided between the different LANs involved. This is achieved by ensuring that the bands are allocated dynamically to the LANs.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A protocol called linear conflict resolution (LCR) for unidirectional broadcast bus networks is introduced. This protocol is shown to be suitable for both LAN (local area network) and MAN (metropolitan area network) environments. LCR combines the benefits of the quick access of the Aloha protocol and the deterministic access of TDMA (time-division multiple access). Not only could the maximum throughput of LCR be increased to near 100% but also the network is stable in that the delay is finite for all the operating conditions. The channel capacity of the LCR protocol is less sensitive to the bus characteristics than most of the existing protocols. Numerical results indicate that LCR exhibits good performance over a wide range of network sizes.<<ETX>>},

year={1988},
volume={},
number={},
pages={264-273},
abstract={Double-loop networks have a higher connectivity and therefore a higher potential for fault tolerance than single-loop networks. The authors present distributed routing schemes that fully utilize that fault-tolerance potential, and that are applicable in particular to a specific class of double-loop networks, characterized by a forward loop connecting all the adjacent nodes, and a backward loop connecting nodes separated by a distance that depends on N, the number of nodes. A nice feature of these schemes is that for a given node, only local knowledge on the status of the neighboring nodes and links is required. Yet the schemes detect faulty nodes and links and adapt to the situation, so that a packet will eventually reach its destination, if there exists a path. A simulation has shown that the average overhead resulting from the schemes, in terms of number of hops, does not exceed 17%, for values of N around 16.<<ETX>>},

They present algorithms for finding the shortest-path and minimum-delay under various waiting constraints and investigate the quality of the derived path. They also show that if departure time from the source node is unrestricted and delay functions are continuous then a shortest path can be found that is simple and achieves a delay as short as the most unrestricted strategy. The optimal waiting time for such cases is also computed. In more restricted transit, it is shown that there exist cases where the minimum delay is finite yet the path that achieves it is infinite.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors consider a static routing problem in a network with failure-prone links. Two copies of each externally generated message are sent from the source to the destination along two disjoint paths with the objective of reducing the delay resulting from retransmissions of unsuccessful packets. They formulate an optimal-routing problem using a suitable delay function. This results in a nonlinear programming problem of minimizing the delay over routing assignment under certain constraints. Specifically, they impose a disjoint-path constraint on the route assignment. This nonlinear program is solved by an iteration method incorporating a combinatorial algorithm. The solution converges to the global minimum for a convex objective function over a convex feasible region.<<ETX>>},

volume={},
number={},
pages={320-325},
abstract={The following model of a packet switch is considered: at each clock tick, the switch attempts to route the head-of-line packet at the buffer of every input port to its destination port. Each output port can receive only one packet at a time, but there may be packets from multiple inputs destined for common output. The switch first selects exactly one packet for each requested output and then routes all selected packets through a self-route interconnection network such as the Batcher-Banyan network. Based on the traffic assumption of periodic packet streams, the necessary and sufficient clock rate is determined in order for the switch to be nonblocking. This result has turned out to be quite different from analyses based on the assumption of random traffic.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The definition of a class of N*N interconnection networks called the parallel delta network (PDN) is studied. For this class of networks the nonblocking conditions are given. In particular, by the graph colouring technique, it has been proved that the minimum number of delta subnetworks (L) necessary to provide the nonblocking property is L=n where n is the size of the basic switching element and S the number of stages required by an N*N delta network. A routing algorithm for the establishment of any permutation has been defined. It operates for any value of n and shows a polynomial time complexity equal to O(N/sup 3///sup 2/). Moreover, in case of the setup of a single connection request, this algorithm assures a time complexity equal to O( square root N). This property makes it well suitable to an asynchronous telecommunication environment.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A class of wavelength-routing optical networks is described on the basis of the interconnection of wavelength multiplexed channels. Unlike previously described optical network structures, these networks allow the reuse of wavelengths in different transmission sections and this leads to fewer wavelengths being needed. A choice of structures using a common set of components leads to the opportunity to design a network according to the geographical distribution of the switching nodes. The structures provide for a set of point-to-point interconnections and, with modest numbers of wavelengths, full interconnection between the optoelectronic nodes is possible at the optical level. In bypassing intermediate electronic stages the networks appear to offer good reliability characteristics. Providing the components in an initial network are designed to utilize bandwidth efficiently, the networks could be upgraded to incorporate more channels, optical switching, and other forms of optical processing at the optical nodes.<<ETX>>},

volume={},

pages={379-390},
abstract={The authors propose a multihop wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) approach, referred to as ShuffleNet, for achieving concurrency in distributed lightwave networks. ShuffleNet can be configured with each user having as few as one fixed-wavelength transmitter and one fixed-wavelength receiver, avoiding both wavelength agility and pretransmission coordination problems. Still, the network can achieve at least 40% of the maximum efficiency possible with wavelength-agile transmitters and receivers. To transmit a packet from one user to another, however, may require routing the packet through intermediate users, each repeating the packet on a new wavelength, until the packet is finally transmitted on a wavelength that the destination user receives. For such a multihop lightwave network, the transmit and receive wavelengths must be assigned to users to provide both a path between all users and the efficient utilization of all wavelength channels. A class of assignment schemes is proposed which is based on a generalization of the perfect shuffle and achieves high efficiency for uniform traffic loads. Physically, the network may take on a variety of topologies, including a bus, tree, or star.<<ETX>>},

An input queue is introduced to describe the waiting system where messages prevented from entering the network are stored in first-come, first-served manner. Both finite and infinite capacity are considered. The model leads to a Markovian queuing system, which is fully solved by matrix-geometric methods. The analytical results show that the optimal window size which maximizes the power criterion including the admission delay is nearly twice the number of hops (nodes of the network) for the model with infinite input-queue capacity.

abstract={A message-switched network with local and global window flow controls is analyzed. Messages arriving to find the global window full or the first destination's local window full are assumed to be lost. Further, if a message from a source system is sent to a destination system of which the local window is full, the message blocks the source system until it can be received from the destination. In that time, no other message can be processed by the source system. An open tandem queueing network model with blocking is developed where the service times are assumed to be general and the scheduling disciplines are first-come, first-served. An approximation algorithm for the effective computation of performance measures, such as the throughput of the system, mean number of messages in the global window, and the mean delay time of the system, is given. The approximation has been validated by several examples; comparing the analytical results with simulation demonstrates good agreement.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors analyze the performance of an end-to-end window-based flow control subject to bandwidth management. In particular, they model a high-level data-link-control-type layer-two protocol, e.g. LAPD, based on positive acknowledgements for correctly received frames. They explicitly model the effect of frame losses on the performance, which takes on a greater significance when some type of bandwidth management is used by the network. When a frame is lost, there are two major recovery mechanisms: REJECT and time-out. Both of them are explicitly incorporated into the analysis. The main performance measure considered is the goodput, i.e. the throughput of frames excluding retransmissions, that the customer can achieve. When the network is at a given level of congestion, it is shown that a customer can choose an appropriate window size to optimize the goodput subject to bandwidth management.<<ETX>>},

The system is modeled, and results for session setup time, message waiting time, and throughput are calculated.

The five components of the architecture are described. The network management protocol (NMP) is based on CCITT/ISO standards, providing an open architecture. The basis of NMP is the CCITT/ISO OSI seven-layer stack. The protocol stack is generally well defined within the standards bodies. Layers 4 (transport), 5 (session), and 6 (presentation) are final specifications. Within Layer 7 (application), there are numerous sublayers used. ACSE (association control service elements), and FTAM (file transfer access and management) are also final specifications. ROS (remote operations services) and CCR (commitment, concurrency and recovery) are official drafts. CMISE (common management information service elements) is a draft proposal.<<ETX>>},

pages={433-},
abstract={Summary form only given. The emerging ISO network management standards support a very general, elegant network management architecture that is easily adapted to the specifics of a particular distributed system, e.g. a network. Because this approach to network management is broadly applicable and will be supported by equipment and software systems available from a number of vendors, it seems likely that the telecommunications industry will simply adopt ISO standards where possible. A telecommunication management network based on ISO standards could soon be procured 'off the shelf' except for two components. One of these would be a system in the local area of the network element which translates (mediates) between the system-specific functions and data structures of a particular vendor and presents to the network and to the operations systems a general, ISO/OSI compliant, interface. The other would be set of applications in the operations systems and workstations that present an operator interface which is as uniform as is possible in a multivendor system.<<ETX>>},

volume={},
number={},
pages={442-448},
abstract={The authors examine the optimal choice of the slot size in terms of bandwidth usage in slotted broadband communication networks based on self-routing switching fabrics and statistical multiplexing schemes. This is a difficult problem, because of the uncertainty of the kinds and of mix of services to be supported by the network. To make this problem less critical, a packet multiplexing scheme is proposed, allowing several packets to be multiplexed in the same slot on a digital link. This scheme aims at avoiding bandwidth inefficiency when the information unit is smaller than the user capacity of a slot. This can take place for transactional data traffic and for packet voice traffic when the voice packet size underutilizes the slot capacity. The performance of a concentrator implementing this feature loaded by a data traffic is evaluated, providing upper bounds on the throughput and evaluating packet delay and buffer occupancy for different input levels.<<ETX>>},

volume={},

pages={459-466},
abstract={Broadband packet switches handling an asynchronous-time-division-multiplexing type protocol format, e.g. Starlite, can achieve buffer efficiencies by sharing buffers between output ports. It is shown that the number of buffers required with sharing, for random traffic, would be overestimated by as much as 30% at 90% traffic load if the negative correlations that naturally exist, for this type of traffic, between packet streams destined for different output ports were not taken into account. In general, the discrepancy increases as the traffic load increases, and decreases as the switch size increases. A general approach is developed for the analysis of set of queues to which the arrival streams are correlated, which could be used to assess the impacts on shared buffer requirements due to other types of stream correlation (e.g. positive correlations) that may result from other traffic assumptions.<<ETX>>},

A station is able to enter a lower latency state whenever its message queue is empty. They present a detailed evaluation and comparison of network performance, based on both analytical and simulation results. The performance of a dual latency token ring is analyzed for the case of limited-to-one service, symmetric traffic, and is compared to the performance of a conventional token ring operating with limited-to-one, gated, or exhaustive service. The authors use discrete-event simulation to model the behavior and performance of a duel latency ring with asymmetric traffic, and compare with the above three service disciplines. Results show a significant reduction in mean waiting time for the dual latency ring, with performance approaching or exceeding that of gated and exhaustive service, for certain ranges of network utilization.<<ETX>>},

An analysis of the resequencing delay and buffer occupancy at a receiver is presented. They construct a model that allows them to derive steady-state results and that makes into consideration system parameters such as number of receivers, propagation delay, and error probabilities of packets and acknowledgements. The main results of the analysis are the distribution of the resequencing delay and the distribution of the number of packets occupying the receiver's buffer. They also derive simple expressions for the mean buffer occupancy at the limit as the packet error probability tends to one. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the effects of system parameters on the behavior of the expected resequencing delay and the expected buffer occupancy.<<ETX>>},

title={Overload control in a finite message storage buffer},
year={1988},
volume={},
number={},
pages={525-534},
abstract={An approach is presented to the analysis of overload control in a finite buffer. The author considers that the original queuing process is modeled by a birth-death (BD) or quasi-birth-death (QBD) process. By overload control, the author means to adapt the input process or the service process during the time period when the buffer content exceeds a certain level. Such control is necessary to reduce the number of system shutdown periods and to protect high-priority messages. The controlled process is no longer to be BD or QBD, which makes direct analysis and computation of the controlled performance more complicated. The analytical method is based on dividing the controlled process into two alternating transient BD or QBD subprocesses, by only observing some selected transitions. Using this method, the author finds closed-form solutions for the queue length distribution when the control is placed on any type of BD process or the M/PH/1/K and PH/M/1/K queues. As an example, this model is applied to the overload control of packet voice transmission on a TDM (time-division-multiplexed) link.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present a group of multidimensional regular topologies with two incoming and two outgoing link per node. The use of a mixed-radix numbering system in defining the network topology leads to many choices for the jump distance, which provides better performance when the total number of nodes is large. They introduce a performance parameter named spanning radius (SPR) which determines the addition traversal required to use all different choices when the number of choices exceeds two. The impact of the number of choices and its SPR on the network performance is also studied. The results show that a multidimensional network performs better in terms of diameter and reliability when the penalty of the extra link traversal is offset by the saving due to the additional jump distance choices used.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A novel implementation is presented, the Stubborn protocol, which provides the right compromise to obtain a balanced and near-optimal performance under both normal (control) operation and transient (emergency) conditions. It is based on the following simple principle: stations make access attempts as in the usual 1-persistent CSMA/CD (carrier-sense multiple-access with collision detection). In case of collision, a station with priority higher than zero will not interrupt transmission, but will exercise its right to extend the collision for a period proportional to its priority level. The station that persists longer will be able to start 'clean' transmission as soon as all others have desisted. The algorithm is complemented with tie-breaking procedures.<<ETX>>},

pages={585-592},
abstract={A network optimization model (NOM) that provides a tool for performance analysis and optimal design of a broad class of routing strategies is presented. It can evaluate and optimize both static and dynamic, local and global routing strategies. The tool is applicable to both packet-switched and circuit-switched networks. NOM software is based on original modeling methods and optimization algorithms. It is user-friendly and menu-driven, and has extensive 'what if' capabilities. NOM can be used for performance evaluation of existing routing strategy and for optimal routing design for a given performance criterion. As a performance evaluation tool, for a given network topology, link and node capacities, point-to-point demand matrix, and routing strategy, NOM models the routing and computes important characteristics of network performance. As a routing optimization tool, for a given network topology, link and node capacities, point-to-point demand matrix, and performance criterion, NOM generates the optimal routing, and computes important characteristics of network performance. The current Telenet local dynamic routing strategy is compared with a set of optimal routing strategies designed for various performance criteria.<<ETX>>},

year={1988},
volume={},
number={},
pages={593-602},
abstract={The authors develop distributed routing algorithms for large computer networks that provide virtual circuit connections to end users. One routing scheme in computer networks is to use a topology database maintained at each node that contains information about nodes and link cost. Using this information, each node finds shortest routes to other nodes. This scheme may be inefficient in large networks since the overhead associated with topology database update and shortest path computation may become large. One way of solving this problem is to partition the network into subnetworks or clusters. After partitioning, each node in a cluster only maintains a topology database of nodes and links in its own cluster and possibly marginal information about the entire network. For intracluster communication, shortest path routes are provided. For intercluster communication the source node collaborates with other nodes to find a path to the destination node. The authors propose two collaboration schemes that use simple protocols among network nodes. In one scheme, a broadcast search is used to find a path to the destination node in other clusters. In the other scheme each node maintains information about intercluster links on an up/down basis as well as complete topology database of its own cluster. Using this information, it finds a path to the destination node with the help of border nodes (nodes sharing intercluster links) in the intermediate clusters.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The problem of routing virtual circuits according to dynamical probabilities in virtual-circuit packet-switched networks is considered. Queueing network models are introduced and performance measures are defined. A decentralized asynchronous adaptive routing methodology based on learning automata theory is presented. Every node in the network has a stochastic learning automaton as a router for every destination node. The routing probabilities that are assigned to the network paths are updated asynchronously on the basis of current network conditions. A learning algorithm suitable for routing is used.

abstract={The authors examine the design and performance of LNTP, a connection-orientated transport-level protocol for local area networks (LANs) in the 4.2 BSD Unix operating system. Various measurements are taken, and LNTP's performance is compared to that of TCP/IP (ARPAnet's Transmission Control Protocol), a LHN protocol which is often used in LAN environments. The optimum values of various LNTP parameters are determined, some theoretically and others empirically. The theoretical results are compared to the experimentally observed values. It is concluded that LNTP does indeed outperform TCP/IP. However, due to the overhead of the non-LNTP specific protocol layers, this improvement is not as great as it might be. Nonetheless, LNTP proves itself to be a viable replacement for TCP/IP.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The data queuing performance is analyzed for a fixed-frame-size, integrated voice-data multiplexer (IVDM), where voice has preemptive priority over data, a maximum capacity is available for voice (above which voice freeze-outs occur), and data is queued when there is insufficient capacity. A discrete-state-continuous-time Markov model is used to model a discrete-state-discrete-time IVDM when the average source burst duration is significantly larger than the multiplexer frame time. The correlation of the voice and data source activity is shown to have a significant effect on IVDM data queuing performance. An approximate, simple analytical model for the mean data queue length is derived. The approximate analytical model for mean data queue length is shown to provide a lower bound for exact calculations and simulation results. The concept of maximizing queuing power (throughput/delay) is applied to the data performance.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An examination is made of the performance of two different approaches for handling the loss and/or corruption of messages as they are transmitted between two end users in a high-speed network. In the link-by-link approach, two adjacent nodes in an end-to-end path locally detect and recover from message loss or corruption along their joining link. In the end-to-end approach, recovery is done solely on the basis of a single end-to-end protocol. The authors develop analytic performance models for comparing the performance of these two approaches; these analytic models are validated by simulation. The models explicitly consider the effects of channel errors, propagation delays of messages and their acknowledgments, both separate and shared VC buffer pools, finite buffer capacities, buffering of unacknowledged messages, and timeout mechanisms. It is found that for the range of network parameters of practical interest, an end-to-end approach toward error control is superior to a link-by-link approach, while requiring fewer network resources.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A study is made of some data-link-layer error-control protocols suitable for point-to-multipoint communication over broadcast channels where data are delivered to the destinations in the order they are sent. The authors study a series of protocols differing in the way that the sender uses the outcomes of the previous transmissions. The protocols are based on the go-back-N schemes discussed by I.S. Gopal and J.M. Jaffe (1984). The authors generalize their proposed protocols to the case where multiple copies of a message are sent (instead of just a single copy). The optimum number of copies is determined, which depends not only on the round-trip propagation delay of the channel and the error probability, but also on the number of receivers that have not yet received the message. A dynamic programming technique is used to solve this optimization problem. The throughput comparison shows that by sending the optimum number of copies of a data frame instead of just a single copy, the performance will be significantly improved.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An investigation is made of various error recovery schemes for a very-high-speed packet switched network. The schemes investigated are: (1) edge-to-edge recovery, whereby retransmission of erred packets only takes place between source and destination nodes, (2) link-by-link recovery, whereby retransmission only takes place between adjacent switching nodes, and (3) link-edge-combined recovery, using both link-by-link and edge-to-edge schemes. The performance measures are the distribution of transmission delay and error probability of packets across a network. To obtain these measures, the authors develop a tandem queuing network model with feedbacks, where each queue represents a protocol layer within a switching node rather than a switching node as a whole. Numerical results show that for a network with very-high-speed/low-error-rate channels, the edge-to-edge scheme gives the smallest packet transmission delay, while keeping the packet error probability sufficiently small. The only drawback of the edge-to-edge scheme is that it causes network saturation at smaller network traffic load than the older schemes.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Novel techniques are described for hand-printed numeral recognition and generation of various-sized high-quality graphic characters, which permit efficient communications between facsimile terminals and computer centers. To achieve extremely precise numeral recognition despite the poor characteristics of the images obtained by facsimile terminals, a supplementary preprocessing method and a similar-shaped-character distribution method have been developed. Using these procedures, about 80% of the characters which cannot be recognized by the basic recognition procedure are rendered recognizable. Transmission bit errors affect encoded facsimile signals of an entry sheet in the form of recognition degradation or failure of row detection mark length. The occurrence probability of these kinds of errors is estimated, and it is shown from the degree of recognition degradation that the impact is negligibly small from the standpoint of practical use. A novel smoothing method for code-to-pattern conversion has also been developed to improve the picture quality of graphic character patterns.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The Rapport multimedia conferencing system supports interactive real-time distributed conferences among two or more people. Rapport executes on personal workstations interconnected by data and voice networks. It is designed to help people emulate face-to-face conferences as closely as possible with their workstations. These conferences can be of different type, including phone conversations, group meetings, or lectures. The authors describe the Rapport system and elaborate on its networking requirements. Based on experience with their initial prototype system, the authors highlight some of the current networking limitations and examine future directions, such as broadband communication, for alleviating these problems.<<ETX>>},

year={1988},
volume={},
number={},
pages={759-770},
abstract={The authors examine the performance of a packet voice multiplexer queue in which the less significant bits on voice packets are dropped during states of congestion in the multiplexer. Using the results of simulation and analytical modeling, it is illustrated that bit dropping on voice packets significantly smoothes the superposition packet voice traffic by speeding up the packet service rate during critical periods of congestion in the queue. This phenomenon renders it possible to approximate the superposition process by a Poisson process for analyzing a packet voice multiplexer with bit dropping. The multiplexer is modeled using an M/D/1/K model in which D denotes the deterministic but state-dependent nature of service. By comparison with a simulation, this model is shown to produce quite accurate performance predictions.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An exploration is made of some techniques which will play important roles in the development of the future universal transport network. In the network, the information can be efficiently integrated and transported by making the most of the burstiness of the information flows and of the store-and-forward process at the transport nodes. First, a coding and multiplexing scheme for audio signals matched to the above transportation mode is proposed. The effectiveness of the scheme is demonstrated through computer simulation and the extent of the deviations are provided for some sets of parameters. The analysis provides useful tools to perform sensitivity analysis of network delay performance.<<ETX>>},

pages={796-804},
abstract={To support real-time applications on a local area network, some recently proposed standards, such as the IEEE 802.4 token bus standard and FDDI, use timers to control station access of the channel in addition to a basic token-passing protocol. The major reason for incorporating the timing mechanism is to avoid excessively long cycles in token-passing that can disrupt real-time services for packetized voice and real-time control. Nevertheless, the timing mechanism is flexible enough to provide priority among non-real-time traffic as well. The authors present an analysis of the throughput performance of the timer-controlled token-passing protocol under heavy load and a few other assumptions. The analysis not only reveals the priority structure of the protocol but also some salient features that render the protocol more favorable than other cycle-limiting schemes (e.g., fixed-maximum channel access per cycle).<<ETX>>},

pages={813-822},
abstract={The authors extend the p/sub i/-persistent protocol previously proposed to include voice for multiaccess communication over unidirectional broadcast bus networks. They use a framed approach for integrating these two traffic types. Further, they use not only speech detectors for modeling speech sources, but also a movable-boundary scheme for their protocol in which the voice subframe size is estimated from the number of voice packets transmitted in the previous frame. The authors determine the fraction of speech loss and the fraction of wasted allocated bandwidth due to the estimator by formulating a Markov chain for the number of ready voice stations at the frame boundaries. To analyze data performance, a nonhomogeneous Markov chain is constructed for a data station's buffer content just before the data slots visit that station. Then, these models are converted to homogeneous chains from which the authors determine the optimum p/sub i/ for each data slot.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors introduce two techniques for computing the reliability of a distributed computing system (DCS).

The second technique, called FARE (Fast Algorithm for Reliability Evaluation), does not require an a priori knowledge of multiterminal connections for computing the reliability expression. A performance parameter called the communication cost index (CCI) is defined. The authors compare algorithms with an existing method in terms of computer time and memory requirement. The results show that FARE outperforms two-step methods.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors present and solve a discrete-time G/sup (X)//D/1-S queuing system with a finite queue size and batch arrivals with a general batch size distribution. The motivation for this model arises from performance modeling of a statistical multiplexer with synchronous transmission of fixed-size data units in synchronous time slots. The arrival process to the multiplexer, for example, may originate from a number of independent sources with packets of variable lengths. Hence, a packet arrival corresponds to an arrival of a batch of data units. Different performance measures such as percentage of packet loss and data-unit loss are considered under two different admission policies of packets into the queue.<<ETX>>},

Throughput and waiting time as a function of the number of users of each type are analyzed under a nonpreemptive rule in which document use has priority over document entry.

abstract={The resequencing problem is considered in a distributed system environment with multiple classes. A system consisting of two parallel heterogeneous M/M/1 queues shared by C different arrival classes is presented and analyzed. Arriving customers are distributed among the two queues according to a probability distribution which depends upon their class. If customers belong to the same class must depart from the server at the same order as they arrived, they incur additional delay called resequencing delay. A recursive solution technique is first introduced to obtain the exact expression for the expected resequencing delay for a single-class case. The result is then extended to the case of a single class with interfering traffic. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate changes of resequencing delay as a function of distributed loads to servers.<<ETX>>},

pages={934-940},
abstract={A design method for packet-switched networks is presented that enhances the reliability and prevents the performance degradation caused by network failures. The method is based on a design technique wherein the redundant capacity is assigned to appropriate links in advance to be capable of accommodating the detoured traffic caused by failed links. Using this technique, it is crucial to accurately evaluate to how large an amount the capacity for each link must be augmented. An augmented capacity function is introduced, which determines the capacity of a link based on the probability of a particular network state and a parameter which represents how important the link is in the state. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the method, in terms of cost/performance effectiveness. The relation between the reliability level and the network cost is discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Multihoming in networks, i.e. attaching a subscriber to more than a single access point in the network, is a mechanism used to improve performance. The authors take the topological design view and address the problem of finding optimal multihoming configurations for several topological design criteria. They analyze the problem and demonstrate that except for dual homing, multihoming is algorithmically complex. Optimal algorithms based on maximum matching in graphs and 0-1 integer programming are given for all cases.<<ETX>>},

pages={946-955},
abstract={The introduction of concentrators in a centralized telecommunication network is considered. The Star-Star (SS) network model is described, and the Star-Star concentrator location problem (SSCLP) is examined. The SSCLP is NP-complete and can be formulated as a 0-1 integer programming problem. A two-phase algorithm is developed to solve the SSCLP. In the first phase, dualizing the side constraints produces a Lagrangian problem that is easy to solve and whose optimal value is a lower bound (for minimization problems) on the optimal value of the original SSCLP. Then, heuristics are applied to produce an upper bound (feasible solution) to the SSCLP. In the second phase, branch-and-bound is used to refine the solution space to obtain a tighter lower bound. Computational examples with up to 100 terminals and 30 potential concentrators are considered. All the network designs obtained are shown to be within 2% of optimal.<<ETX>>},

volume={},

pages={956-965},
abstract={An approximate performance evaluation technique for analyzing load-dependent interactive queueing systems is proposed. The service stations in the queuing system are heterogeneous., i.e. they have different service rates. As an example, the authors apply this analytical method to a recently proposed receiver-initiated dynamic load balancing scheme in a multiple-station distributed heterogeneous computer system. This performance model attempts to obtain approximations to the steady-state distribution of the average system response time for a multiple-node heterogeneous scenario. The results are validated using a GPSS (general-purpose system simulation) model. Comparison between this approximation model and the simulation results show excellent agreement. The performance of the ERIDA scheme is compared with the no-load-sharing case and also with a centralized load-balancing scheme. These latter systems provide lower and upper bounds on performance of a distributed and sharing scheme.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors study the database query scheduling problem at STPs (signal transfer points) in a CCS (common channel signaling) network. For each arriving query, the STP can send the query to either one of the mated SCPs (service control points) to which it is connected. The authors consider a class of query scheduling policies ranging from policies that do not require any instantaneous workload information from SCPs to a policy that requires such information. Queuing models that describe the behavior of SCPs under each scheduling policy are developed and solved to yield the mean response-time performance of query processing. The authors carry out simulation experiments to obtain the second moment statistics of the response time performance. The results show that when SCPs provide enough concurrent processing capability, a simple round-robin policy yields a good performance as that of a more sophisticated policy requiring instantaneous workload information from SCPs.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors consider the problem of job placement in load-sharing algorithms for large heterogeneous distributed computing environments.

abstract={The authors defines multiple-access method suitable for a centralized multiple satellite network, with onboard processing in the central node. This multiple-access method (CDMA/Aloha/BFN) is a combination of code-division multiple-access (CDMA), random multiple access (RMA) or Aloha, and a set of electronic beam forming networks (BFN). CDMA/Aloha/BFN multiple access maintains the advantages of CDMA and RMA techniques and avoids their disadvantages by using some processing on board the central satellite stations. The major characteristics of this method are: no need for network synchronization resistance to jamming, efficient use of the available system power and bandwidth, low equipment complexity, low mutual interference, ability to operate in systems supporting highly dynamic users, and good delay-throughput performance. The theory of operation of the CDMA/Aloha/BFN multiple-access technique is described and its performance is analyzed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A multibeam satellite communications network serving multiple zones with S-Aloha random-access uplinks and dynamically switched transponders in the downlinks is studied. The overhead of switching transponders between zones may degrade the performance of the system significantly. Two different strategies are introduced and studied. In the Guard Time strategy, each slot time is equal to the packet transmission time plus the transponder switching time, allowing the transponder to be pointed to a new zone at the beginning of each slot. In the Idle Waiting strategy, each slot time is equal to the packet transmission time. If a transponder is switched to a new zone, it will take k slot time, where k is the smallest integer greater than the switching time divided by the slot time. The throughputs of these two strategies are analyzed and compared.<<ETX>>},

volume={},
number={},
pages={1032-1039},
abstract={Optimal allocation of redundant resources in distributed computing systems is studied. In this model, a request from a processing site for a resource can be satisfied by any one of the copies. Among the redundant copies of the resources, the least-expensive and the second-least-expensive ones are considered for accessing by each processing site, which is measured in terms of communication cost. This access scheme offers to encompass some of the intrinsically important features, such as graceful degradation and reliability consideration, in the design model. The increase of communication cost due to the failures of resources should be gradual to maintain the system performance. With the present formulation, the goal of the allocation is to minimize the total communication cost incurred. The Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient methods are applied to solve this problem. An efficient algorithm based on these techniques, and computational results, are presented.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Stochastic rendezvous networks (SRVN) are models for the throughput of distributed programs executed concurrently and synchronously on distributed computing nodes. Server tasks respond to requests from user tasks and execute in a two-phase pattern (in-rendezvous phase, then postrendezvous phase), and may themselves act as user tasks to further servers, to any depth. The authors extend the model to permit the execution time and the occurrence of nested rendezvous calls to depend on the identity of the calling user task. An iterative approximation method is developed, and compared to exact throughput calculations found with timed Petri nets. The approximation has errors of a few percent in most cases, and executes very much faster than the Petri-net calculation.<<ETX>>},

A symmetric subset of the CCITT Q.931 recommendation as it stood in August 1987 is proposed. The need for bearer-channel negotiations is eliminated by using a 'two-way independent channel selection' technique in which each end of the link is master in the transmit direction and slave in the receive direction. A logical model for the signalling system's network layer processor is developed to aid in understanding the Q.931 protocol. The model also serves as the initial functional partitioning for the VLSI implementation. The key element of the model is the separation of the network-layer processor into a protocol-specific module (PSM) and an application-specific module (ASM).<<ETX>>},

abstract={Distributed dynamic channel assignment algorithms for a multihop packet radio network are introduced. The algorithms ensure conflict-free transmissions by the nodes of the network. The basic idea of the algorithms is to split the shared channel into a control segment and a transmission segment. The control segment is used to avoid conflicts among the nodes and to increase the utilization of the transmission segment. It is shown how these algorithms can be used to determine time-division multiaccess cycles with spatial reuse of the channel.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors consider multihop, mobile, packet radio networks that need to determine broadcasting transmission schedules in a distributed way with the goal of avoiding interference and achieving reasonable efficiency. Several centralized scheduling schemes have been proposed in the literature, while very few and mostly ad hoc distributed schemes have been considered that generally suffer from serious weaknesses. The authors propose a distributed scheme for scheduling broadcasts that involves very limited overhead and has very good efficiency performance.<<ETX>>},

title={A distributed, loop-free, shortest-path routing algorithm},
year={1988},

pages={1125-1137},
abstract={A new distributed algorithm for the dynamic computation of the shortest paths in a computer network is presented, validated, and analyzed. According to this algorithm, each node maintains the lengths of the shortest path to each network destination and a feasibility vector. Update messages from a node are sent only to its neighbors; each such message contains one or more entries, and each entry specifies the length of the selected path to a network destination, and whether the node requires internodal coordination. The algorithms extends the Jaffe-Moss routing algorithm by allowing nodes to choose new successors to destinations with no need for internodal coordination if the new successors are considered to be at most at the same distance as the current successors. The algorithm is shown to converge in a finite time after an arbitrary sequence of topological changes, to be loop-free at every instant (independently of the delays in the network) and to outperform other previously proposed loop-free, shortest-path algorithms from the standpoint of combined temporal, message, and storage complexities.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Network management is an extremely complex subject. While it is becoming easier to provide intelligence within network elements to satisfy the demand for greater sophistication, automation, and decentralization of operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) functions, a key challenge is 'managing' the system design process. Without an effective design process, it is unlikely that the real potential of a network management system can be realized. The author outlines the key challenge and issues facing network management system designers, and proposes a solution.<<ETX>>},
