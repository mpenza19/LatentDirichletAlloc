abstract={Several technical issues must be resolved before ATM services can be efficiently extended to the wireless environment. Key issues include incorporating the characteristics of the time-varying wireless channel in the provisioning of the cell-level QoS, and improving the transport performance using error control mechanisms. We analyze the cell loss and delay performance over a wireless ATM link. We consider both cases of a single and multiplexed ATM connections. The link capacity fluctuates according to a fluid version of Gilbert-Elliot channel model. Traffic sources are modeled as on-off fluid processes. The analytical framework incorporates the effects of error control schemes (i.e., ARQ and/or FEC), which are used to improve the transport performance over the wireless link. For the single-stream case, we derive the mean delay and the cell loss rate (CLR) due to buffer overflow at the sender side of the wireless link. We also obtain a closed-form approximation for the corresponding wireless effective bandwidth. In the case of multiplexed streams, we obtain a good approximation for the CLR using the Chernoff-dominant eigenvalue (CDE) approach. The expressions for the CLR and effective bandwidth are then used to study the optimal FEC code rate that guarantees the requested QoS while maximizing the utilization of the wireless bandwidth. Numerical results and simulations are used to verify the adequacy of our analysis and to study the impact of error control on the allocation of bandwidth for guaranteed cell loss and delay performance.},

title={A simple QoS signaling protocol for mobile hosts in the integrated services Internet},

pages={1011-1018 vol.3},
abstract={With advances in packet routing technology, and resource reservation protocols, the Internet is expected to provide ubiquitous integrated transport of speech, audio, video, and other real-time multimedia data in addition to the current best effort data traffic. Such integrated transport will also need to be supported for the increasing number of mobile users who access the Internet over wireless access networks, using Mobile-IP to retain continual IP connectivity. We present a simple quality of service (QoS) signaling protocol for mobile users in an integrated service Internet. The protocol works by combining pre-provisioned RSVP tunnels with Mobile IP. Our protocol, even-though simple, captures the essence of QoS provisioning for wireless and mobile networks. The wireless medium provides a completely different medium than wires, and therefore one's expectations from it should be different. Service quality is inherently mobility dependent, and intermittent disconnections are bound to happen. It is not the signaling protocol's task to completely overcome or conceal transient conditions from applications, but rather applications should try to adapt. Our approach can be easily implemented today with minimal changes to other components of the Internet architecture. We also evaluate the application level performance impact of the QoS provisioning delays associated with our protocol on a prototypical packet speech application with various playout buffering strategies, and compare against the performance of the ordinary RSVP protocol suite with Mobile IP.},

abstract={Supporting quality of service (QoS) guarantees in wireless networks requires that admission control algorithms incorporate user mobility, and limit the probability that sufficient resources are unavailable when a user must handoff. We develop a framework for designing admission control algorithms in wireless networks that support guaranteed QoS. First, we devise a taxonomy to explore the mathematical structure and practical design tradeoffs encountered in developing admission control algorithms. We next introduce the perfect knowledge admission control algorithm, which, while unrealizable in practice, serves as a benchmark for evaluating admission control algorithms by using future knowledge of handoff events to exactly control the admissible region. Finally, we perform an extensive set of simulations (including trace-driven simulations) and, applying the perfect knowledge algorithm, we study several admission control algorithm from the literature, identify a number of key system parameters for algorithm design, and quantify the fundamental tradeoffs in complexity and accuracy as revealed by the taxonomy.},

pages={1036-1043 vol.3},
abstract={We consider the performance analysis of an ATM multiplexer supporting both delay sensitive (e.g. silence detected voice) and loss sensitive (e,g. data) traffic flows. The delay sensitive cells are stored in a finite (relatively small) buffer and are given service priority over loss sensitive cells in each slot. In our formulation, we allow both classes to have a general (Markovian) correlation structure. A simple matrix geometric solution for the state probability of the system is provided allowing simple computation of any desired performance metric such as loss probability and buffer requirements of high and low priority classes, respectively. We provide number of numerical results. In particular, we consider the superposition of Bernoulli on-off sources often used to model silence detected packetized voice-like traffic as a high priority class. The example for low priority traffic is taken to be i.i.d batches of geometric distribution and two-state correlated batches. The numerical results show that both the loss behavior and the buffer requirements are quite sensitive to the (average) burst size of high priority traffic. In particular, it is demonstrated that for any level of utilization, the buffer requirements for both classes appear to be almost proportional to the burst size of the high priority class. The performance of low priority traffic is shown to be quite sensitive to its correlation structure. This class suffers most if both low and high priority traffic are very bursty.},

pages={1044-1052 vol.3},
abstract={Provision of quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees is an important and challenging issue in the design of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. call admission control (CAC) is an integral part of the challenge and is closely related to other aspects of network designs such as traffic characterization and QoS specification. Since the usage parameter control (UPC) parameters are the only standardized traffic characterization, developing efficient CAC schemes based on UPC parameters is significant for the implementation of CAC on ATM switches. We develop a CAC algorithm called TAP (derived from tagged probability) as well as two other CAC algorithms using the UPC parameters. These CAC algorithms are based on our observation that the loss-probability-to-overflow-probability ratio tends to decrease as the number of sources increases. By introducing the loss-probability-to-overflow-probability ratio K, we find that this ratio sheds light on increasing resource utilization while still guaranteeing QoS. Analysis, simulation, and numerical results have shown that the TAP algorithm is simple and efficient.},

abstract={Connection admission control (CAC) algorithms are used to decide whether an incoming connection should be accepted or rejected in a node of a network offering reservation based services in order to maintain the guaranteed quality of service (QoS) in the network. In this paper, we consider the statistical CAC algorithm proposed by Elwalid et al. (see IEEE JSAC, vol.13, no.6, p.1048-56, 1995). The traffic model is made of on-off sources and the QoS parameter is the loss probability. Based on the traffic descriptors of existing and incoming connections, the algorithm takes its decision by computing an upper bound of this probability and checking whether it is larger than a given tolerance /spl epsiv/. Usually this tolerance is a fixed, given parameter. We propose here to adapt /spl epsiv/ to react to the actual losses experienced at the node using a simple regulation mechanism: if the actual loss rate is much smaller than the targeted loss rate, /spl epsiv/ is increased to make a more aggressive usage of the available resources, and vice versa if the actual loss rate is too high. We discuss the influence of the regulation parameters and we show that despite its simplicity this regulated CAC improves significantly the performance of its non-tunable counterpart.},

title={Guaranteeing statistical QoS to regulated traffic: the single node case},
year={1999},
volume={3},

pages={1061-1072 vol.3},
abstract={Multimedia traffic can typically tolerate some loss but has rigid delay constraints. A natural QoS requirement for a multimedia connection is a prescribed bound on the the fraction of traffic that exceeds an end-to-end delay limit. We propose and analyze a traffic management scheme which guarantees QoS to multimedia traffic while simultaneously allowing for a large connection-carrying capacity. We study our traffic management scheme in the context of a single node. In order for the node to guarantee QoS, each connection's traffic is regulated. In order to support many connections, the link statistically multiplexes the connections' traffic. The scheme consists of (i) cascaded leaky-buckets for traffic regulation, (ii) smoothers at the ingresses, and (iii) bufferless statistical multiplexing within the node. For this scheme we show that loss probabilities are minimized with simple one-buffer smoothers which operate at specific minimum rates. We also show that the worst-case input traffic is extremal on-off traffic for all connections. These two results lead to a straightforward scheme for guaranteeing QoS to regulated traffic. Using MPEG video traces, we present numerical results which demonstrate the methodology. Finally, we compare the bufferless scheme with buffered statistical multiplexing.},

year={1999},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1073-1080 vol.3},
abstract={With the proliferation of multimedia group applications, the construction of multicast trees satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements is becoming a problem of prime importance. Many of the multicast applications (such as video broadcasts and teleconferencing) require the network to support dynamic multicast sessions wherein the membership of the multicast group changes with time. We propose and evaluate an algorithm for on-line update of multicast trees to adjust to changes in group membership. The algorithm is based on a concept called quality factor (QF) that represents the usefulness of a portion of the multicast tree to the overall multicast session. When the usefulness of a particular region of the tree drops below a threshold, a rearrangement technique is used to suitably modify the tree. This algorithm aims to satisfy the delay-constraints of all current group members, at the same time minimizing the cost of the constructed tree. We compare the performance of our algorithm, by simulation, with that of an off-fine Steiner heuristic; with ARIES, a previously published algorithm for on-line update of unconstrained trees; and with the algorithm proposed by Hong, Lee and Park (see Proc. of IEEE INFOCOM, pp. 1433-40, 1998) for on-line update of delay-constrained trees. The simulation results indicate that our algorithm provides excellent cost-competitiveness that is better than that provided by the algorithm described by Hong et al., minimizes changes in the multicast tree after each update, and performs favorably even when compared with the unconstrained ARIES heuristic.},

Optimal structures which minimize resource consumption are deduced, which allows for simple dimensioning rules, such as how many hierarchical levels should be used. A stochastic geometric approach turned out to be well adapted for this study. This approach leads to explicit expressions for the average tree cost, as a function of the hierarchical clustering, from which the optimal tree structure can then be easily deduced.},

title={A dynamic bootstrap mechanism for rendezvous-based multicast routing},
year={1999},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1090-1098 vol.3},
abstract={Current multicast routing protocols can be classified into three types according to how the multicast tree is established: broadcast and prune (e.g., DVMRP, PIM-DM), membership advertisement (e.g., MO-SPF), and rendezvous-based (e.g., CBT, PIM-SM). Rendezvous-based protocols associate with each logical multicast group address, a physical unicast address, referred to as the 'core' or 'rendezvous point' (RP). Members first join a multicast tree rooted at this rendezvous point in order to receive data packets sent to the group. Rendezvous mechanisms are well suited to large wide-area networks because they distribute group-specific data and membership information only to those routers that are on the multicast distribution tree. However, rendezvous protocols require a bootstrap mechanism to map each logical multicast address to its current physical rendezvous point address. The bootstrap mechanism must adapt to network and router failures but should minimize unnecessary changes in the group-to-RP mapping. In addition, the bootstrap mechanism should be transparent to the hosts. This paper describes and analyzes the bootstrap mechanism developed for PIM-SM. The mechanism employs an algorithmic mapping of multicast group to rendezvous point address, based on a set of available RPs distributed throughout a multicast domain. The primary evaluation measures are convergence time, message distribution overhead, balanced assignment of groups to RPs, and host impact. The mechanism as a whole, and the design lessons in particular, are applicable to other rendezvous-based multicast routing protocols as well.},

title={Ring versus tree embedding for real-time group multicast},
year={1999},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1099-1106 vol.3},
abstract={In general topology networks, routing from one node to another over a tree embedded in the network is intuitively a good strategy, since it typically results in a route length of O(log n) links, being n the number of nodes in the network. Routing from one node to another over a ring embedded in the network would result in route length of O(n) links. However, in group (many-to-many) multicast, the overall number of links traversed by each packet, i.e., the networks elements on which resources must be possibly reserved, is typically O(N) for both tree and ring embedding, where N is the size of the group. This paper focuses on the tree versus ring embedding for real-time group multicast in which all packets should reach all other nodes in the group with a bounded end-to-end delay. In this work, real-time properties are guaranteed by the deployment of time driven priority in network nodes. In order to have a better understanding of the non-trivial problem of ring versus tree embedding, we consider the following group multicast scenarios: (i) static-fixed subset of active nodes, (ii) dynamic-fixed number of active nodes (i.e., the identity of active nodes is changing over time, but its size remains constant), and (iii) adaptive the number and identity of active nodes change over time. Tree and ring embedding are compared using the following metrics: (i) end-to-end delay bound, (ii) overall bandwidth allocated to the multicast group, and (iii) signaling overhead for sharing of the resources allocated to the group. The results are interesting and counter-intuitive, since, as shown, embedding a tree is not always the best strategy. In particular, dynamic and adaptive multicast on a tree requires a protocol for updating state information and coordinates the operation of the group. Such a protocol is not required on the ring where the circular topology, and implicit token passing mechanisms are sufficient. Moreover, the bandwidth allocation on the ring for the three multicast scenarios is O(N); while on a general tree it is O(N) for the static multicast scenario and O(N/sup 2/) for the dynamic and adaptive multicast scenarios.},

Packet programs are written in our special purpose programming language PLAN, the Packet Language for Active Networks, while dynamic router extensions are written in OCaml, a dialect of ML. Currently, PLANet routers run as byte-code-interpreted Linux user-space applications, and support Ethernet and IP as link layers. PLANet achieves respectable performance on standard networking operations: on 300 MHz Pentium-II's attached to 100 Mbps Ethernet, PLANet can route 48 Mbps and switch over 5000 packets per second. We demonstrate the utility of PLANet's activeness by showing experimentally how it can nontrivially improve application and aggregate network performance in congested conditions.},

abstract={This paper proposes a simple methodology for constructing extensible and high-fidelity TCP/IP simulators in BSD UNIX environments. A simulator constructed under this methodology will simulate multiple network nodes by re-entering the UNIX kernel of the simulation host multiple times. Generated simulation results are derived from executing the native TCP/IP protocol stack on the simulation host. They are thus more accurate than those generated from a TCP/IP network simulator that implements only an abstraction of a real-life TCP/IP implementation. By using this methodology, the simulator architecture creates an illusion for the BSD UNIX kernel that the simulated network is a real network. All existing application programs such as FTP, telnet and HTTP, and all network utilities such as route, ifconfig and tcpdump are immediately applicable to a simulated network for generating network traffic, configuring networks, gathering statistics, etc. Additionally, the network simulator provides the standard UNIX API on every node in a simulated network so that ally existing or future application program can run on any node in a simulated network. This allows a network simulator to be easily extended to study high-level network architecture and application issues.},

abstract={We consider the problem of scheduling packets in an input-queued switch when both unicast and multicast traffic is present. In contrast to current approaches which mostly isolate unicast from multicast, we propose an integrated scheduling procedure that packs unicast cells into idle slots left by the multicast schedule. While the optimal integrated schedule can be shown to be NP-hard to obtain, we propose both off-line and on-line algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees to perform integration efficiently, Simulations suggest significant improvement in switch throughput using the integrated schedule. To further reinforce the importance of performing integration, we study the multicast scheduling problem with and without fanout splitting. Again, we prove hardness of the problem and several of its variants, and propose competitive algorithms. The hardness of multicast scheduling hence emphasizes the importance of integrated scheduling for switch performance.},

year={1999},

pages={1152-1159 vol.3},
abstract={Input-queued switching architectures are becoming an attractive alternative for designing very high speed switches owing to its scalability. Tremendous efforts have been made to overcome the throughput problem caused by contentions occurred at the input and output sides of the switches. However, no QoS guarantees can be provided by the current input-queued switch design. In this paper, a frame based scheduling algorithm, referred to as store-sort-and-forward (SSF), is proposed to provide QoS guarantees for input-queued switches without requiring speedup. SSF uses a framing strategy in which the time axis is divided into constant-length frames, each made up of an integer multiple of time slots. Cells arrived during a frame are first held in the input buffers, and are then "sorted-and-transmitted" within the next frame. A bandwidth allocation strategy and a cell admission policy are adopted to regulate the traffic to conform to the (r,T) traffic model. A strict sense 100% throughput is proved to be achievable by rearranging the cell transmission orders in each input buffer, and a sorting algorithm is proposed to order the cell transmission. The SSF algorithm guarantees bounded end-to-end delay and delay jitter. It is proved that a perfect matching can be achieved within N(ln N+O(1)) effective moves.},

abstract={In this paper we consider an output port of an ATM switch, where cell streams belonging to different TCP and UDP sessions arrive. During congestion the switch applies early packet discard (EDP) in order to reduce bandwidth waste. In order to guarantee fairness in the sense that only misbehaving sources get affected by the packet drop mechanism and to ensure high server utilization we propose an algorithm which also features simplicity. A salient feature of this algorithm is that it allows a predefined share /spl alpha//sub i/ to be associated with stream i. The algorithm (which we call the weighted fair EPD, WFEPD) attempts to provide this weighted share of the bandwidth for the streams in the long time average. A sliding window implementation of WFEPD allows us to demonstrate its efficiency in terms of fairness and bandwidth utilization.},

pages={1169-1178 vol.3},
abstract={The Internet is facing two problems simultaneously: there is a need for a faster switching/routing infrastructure, and a need to introduce guaranteed qualities of service (QoS). Each problem can be solved independently: switches and routers can be made faster by using input-queued crossbars, instead of shared memory systems; and QoS can be provided using WFQ-based packet scheduling. However, until now, the two solutions have been mutually exclusive-all of the work on WFQ-based scheduling algorithms has required that switches/routers use output-queueing, or centralized shared memory. This paper demonstrates that a combined input output queueing (CIOQ) switch running twice as fast as an input-queued switch can provide precise emulation of a broad class of packet scheduling algorithms, including WFQ and strict priorities. More precisely, we show that a "speedup" of 2 is sufficient, and a speedup of 2-1/N is necessary, for this exact emulation. We introduce a variety of algorithms that configure the crossbar so that emulation is achieved with a speedup of two, and consider their running time and implementation complexity. An interesting feature of our work is that the exact emulation holds for all input traffic patterns. We believe that, in the future, these results will make possible the support of QoS in very high bandwidth routers.},

abstract={Enhancing system capacity while maintaining quality of service is an important issue in wireless cellular networks. In this paper, we present a localized channel sharing scheme to address this problem. Our basic idea is to allow channels to be shared between adjacent cells at the expense of a smaller initial allocation of channels per cell. We show that this tradeoff results in a better utilization of network resources. An important feature of our sharing scheme is that channel management is localized between adjacent cells, and no global coordination or optimization is required, thus making it suitable for implementation. The sharing scheme can also facilitate handoff processing. We provide numerical results comparing our scheme with the channel reservation technique, and find a significant performance improvement over a wide range of traffic parameters and a variety of quality of service requirements.},

abstract={This paper studies mobile-generated traffic distributions in mobile ATM networks and evaluates the performance of path rerouting algorithms for handoff control. In mobile ATM networks, user mobility and handoff path rerouting may produce extra traffic load over network links, requiring larger network capacity to support the same QoS. We propose a flow model for mobile ATM networks. The model represents the mobile-generated traffic as a set of stochastic flows over a set of OD (origin-destination) pairs. The user mobility is defined by transfer probabilities of the flows and the handoff path rerouting algorithm is modeled by a transformation between the routing functions for traffic flows. The analysis shows that user mobility may cause temporal variations as well as smoothing effects on the network traffic. Using the flow network model, typical handoff path rerouting algorithms are evaluated through both analytical and experimental approaches. The evaluation methodology can be used for either redesigning the network topology for a given path rerouting algorithm or selecting a path rerouting algorithm for a given network topology under a specific mobile service scenario.},

abstract={User mobility management is one of the important components of mobile multimedia systems. In a cell-based network, a mobile should be able to seamlessly obtain transmission resources after handoff to a new basestation. This is essential for both service continuity and quality of service assurance. We present strategies for accommodating continuous service to mobile users through estimating resource requirements of potential handoff connections. A diverse mix of heterogeneous traffic with diverse resource requirements is considered. We investigate static and dynamic resource allocation schemes. The dynamic scheme probabilistically estimates the potential number of connections that will be handed off from neighboring cells, for each class of traffic. The performance of these strategies in terms of connection blocking probabilities for handoff and local new connection requests are evaluated. The performance is also compared to a scheme previously proposed by Yu and Leung (see IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol.15, p.1208-25, 1997). The results indicate that using dynamic estimation and allocation, we can significantly reduce the dropping probability for handoff connections.},

year={1999},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1212-1219 vol.3},
abstract={We study the delay characteristics of fair queueing algorithms with a stochastic comparison approach. In integrated services networks, fair queueing (FQ) policies have received much attention, because they can guarantee an end-to-end session delay bound when the burstiness of the session traffic is bounded, and they ensure the fair allocation of the bandwidth. A large class of FQ policies attempt to emulate generalized processor sharing (GPS) policy by assigning timestamps to cells. These GPS related policies have quite complex dynamic, and their exact analytical analysis is not tractable. The delay characteristics of these algorithms are evaluated by considering the worst-case, when sources have a bounded burstiness. In fact, these are deterministic delay bounds which do not always provide an insight on the underlying policies. For instance, in the case of leaky bucket constrained traffic, these bounds correspond to the case when all sessions are greedy (each session must empty the token pool in the minimum time after becoming active). We propose a methodology to analyze delay characteristics of a class of GPS-related FQ policies with general source models by providing stochastic bounds on their delay distribution. These stochastic bounds are obtained by analyzing two modified weighted round robin (WRR) policies. Clearly, since cells are scheduled periodically according to a predefined list under WRR-related policies, their models are simpler than the models of GPS-related policies.},

year={1999},
volume={3},

pages={1220-1230 vol.3},
abstract={Generalized processor sharing (GPS) is the basis for the packet scheduler of choice in IP routers and ATM switches of the future. The currently accepted approach for the design of GPS schedulers is based on deterministic QoS guarantees, which, it is generally accepted, is overly conservative and leads to limitations on capacity. We develop a framework for GPS scheduling which is based on statistical QoS guarantees and statistical multiplexing. We give the design of GPS weights which maximize the coverage of operating points, and also the design of the connection admission control (CAC). The general framework is end-to-end, with two heterogeneous QoS classes coexisting with a third, best effort class. Each QoS class has a specified delay bound together with a bound on the probability of its violation. An important objective is to maximize the bandwidth available to best effort traffic, while just satisfying the guarantees of the QoS classes. To this end, we consider output regulated GPS scheduling, which limits each connection's share of the bandwidth to a designed value. The sources are subject to standard dual leaky bucket regulation. For the design of the GPS weights we give procedures based on two key concepts, the realizable set and the critical weights. The realizable set is the union of all admissible sets of connections of both classes over all weights. One of the main contributions is a pragmatic design process by which most of the realizable set is realized by only two critical weights. The numerical results show that there are substantial capacity gains from statistical multiplexing.},

year={1999},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1231-1238 vol.3},
abstract={Cut-through switching has been used as a way to reduce network latency. In particular, with ATM, packets are broken up into fixed length cells, and each cell is forwarded without having to wait for the remaining cells of the packet. However, with the interest in VC-merging, packets from multiple virtual circuits are merged into a single virtual circuit on an output link. In this case, it is critical to retain the fundamental characteristic of ATM to not interleave cells of a packet with that of another. VC-merging arises often, as in the case of a multipoint-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-point connection. We examine the stability of policies for cut-through switching when VCs are merged. We consider a queueing model of a single VC merge point employing cut-through switching. We show that, if subunits of packets cannot be interleaved on the output link, a simple round-robin polling service discipline may make the merge point unstable. Instability means that the input queues have a tendency to build up infinitely even though the total input data rate is less than the output link capacity. We prove that the round-robin discipline is stable if the merge point is symmetric in that packet rates on all input VCs are equal (or at least "almost equal"). We also prove that two simple modifications of the round-robin discipline make the merge point always stable. Simulation results of one of the modifications show improved performance over "pure" cut-through and store-and-forward, at least in some cases.},

abstract={For a multiplexer fed with a large number of sources, we derive conditions under which a single source can be substituted for a given subset of the sources while preserving the buffer overflow probability and the dominant time scales of buffer overflows. This equivalence is stronger than simple effective bandwidth equality and takes into account the context in which multiplexing takes place. This allows a substitution to be made for arbitrarily large proportions of the traffic without changing the operating point of the multiplexer as experienced by the rest of the traffic. It corresponds to defining a single source which is equivalent in a sense "local" to a given context, rather than equivalent in a sense which is "universal" to all contexts. The proposed methodology does not rely on traffic models and obtains the necessary information from the actual traffic traces. We study the case of fractional Brownian motion as a single source substitute and provide theoretical and experimental results that validate our approach.},

We show that, compared to other repair service protocols, our protocols require less buffer inside the network, maintain the low bandwidth requirements of previously proposed repair service/FEC combination protocols, and reduce the amount of FEC processing at repair servers, moving more of this processing to the end-hosts. We also examine repair service/FEC combination protocols in an environment where loss rates differ across domains within the network. We find that repair services are more effective than FEC at reducing bandwidth utilization in such environments. Furthermore, adding FEC to a repair services protocol not only reduces buffer requirements at repair servers, but also reduces bandwidth utilization in domains with high loss, or in domains with large populations of receivers.},

Some applications, like distributed whiteboard and news articles, require detection and retransmission of lost packets. In order to scale to large groups, local recovery is necessary to avoid involving the entire group in the repair process for packet losses affecting small regions of the distribution tree. While many current research efforts have attempted to devise local recovery schemes that rely only on the existing service model, we believe that extending the multicast forwarding service could enable viable and highly scalable local recovery mechanisms. To investigate this open issue, we propose a new randomized forwarding service called randomcast, and build upon it a loss recovery protocol called search party. Starting with the local recovery structure of the very scalable lightweight multicast services (LMS) scheme, we use randomized forwarding to greatly improve robustness at a modest cost in overhead and/or retransmission delay (the trade off between the two costs is fine-tunable). Analysis predicts that as the group size N increases, overhead will increase by at most log N and retransmission delay will be unaffected. Simulation experiments show that both increase very little as N grows from 8 to 64, and confirm the tunability of the trade-off.},

title={MTCP: scalable TCP-like congestion control for reliable multicast},
year={1999},

pages={1265-1273 vol.3},
abstract={We present MTCT, a congestion control scheme for large-scale reliable multicast. Congestion control for reliable multicast is important because of its wide applications in multimedia and collaborative computing, yet nontrivial, because of the potentially large number of receivers involved. Many schemes have been proposed to handle the recovery of lost packets in a scalable manner; but there is little work on the design and implementation of congestion control schemes for reliable multicast. We propose new techniques that can effectively handle instances of congestion occurring simultaneously at various parts of a multicast tree. Our protocol incorporates several novel features: (1) hierarchical congestion status reports that distribute the load of processing feedback from all receivers across the multicast group, (2) the relative time delay (RTD) concept which overcomes the difficulty of estimating round-trip times in tree-based multicast environments, (3) window-based control that prevents the sender from transmitting faster than packets leave the bottleneck link an the multicast path through which the sender's traffic flows, (4) a retransmission window that regulates the flow of repair packets to prevent local recovery from causing congestion, and (5) a selective acknowledgment scheme that prevents independent (i.e., non-congestion-related) packet loss from reducing the sender's transmission rate. We have implemented MTCP both on UDP in SunOS 5.6 and on the simulator ns, and we have conducted extensive Internet experiments and simulation to test the scalability and inter-fairness properties of the protocol. The encouraging results we have obtained support our confidence that TCP-like congestion control for large-scale reliable multicast is within our grasp.},

abstract={Web caching or web proxy has been considered as the prime vehicle of coping with the ever-increasing demand for information retrieval over the Internet, the WWW being a typical example. Existing work on web proxy has primarily focused on content based caching; relatively less attention has been given to the development of proper placement strategies for the potential web proxies in the Internet. In this paper, we argue that the placement of web proxies is critical to the performance and further investigates the optimal placement policy of web proxies for a target web server in the Internet. The objective is to optimize a given performance measure for the target web server subject to system resources and traffic pattern. Specifically, we are interested in finding the optimal placement of multiple web proxies (M) among potential sites (N) under a given traffic pattern. We show this can be modeled a dynamic programming problem. We further obtain the optimal solution for the tree topology using O(N/sup 3/M/sup 2/) time.},

abstract={This paper suggests that since web browsing is an interactive process and downloading a web page can take several seconds to several minutes over slow links, the information presented to the user during this time is important. We present new metrics and visualization techniques to illustrate and quantify web page loading. Given the insight afforded by the metrics, we propose a methodology to improve web access using a new technique, globally progressive interactive web delivery. This technique views the web delivery process as the remote display of a web page and entails applying progressive coding to the document transmission process in its entirety. It also allows the user to explicitly direct link bandwidth to images of interest. This globally progressive interactive framework has been prototyped without modifying either existing web browsers or servers through the use of a web proxy and browser-side Java applets. The framework allows for both protocol and image compression research in a platform-independent manner. Directions of current work on integrating the architecture into existing web infrastructure for greater performance and scalability are discussed.},

abstract={Network-aware applications attempt to adjust their resource demands in response to changes in resource availability, e.g., if a server maintains a connection to a client, the server may want to adjust the amount of data sent to the client based on the effective bandwidth realized for the connection. Information about current and future network performance is therefore crucial for an adaptive application. This paper discusses three aspects of the coupling of applications and networks: (1) a network-aware application needs timely information about the status of the network; (2) a simple bandwidth estimation technique per forms reasonably well for TCP-Reno connections without timeouts; (3) enhancements proposed to TCP-Reno to reduce the number of timeouts (i.e., SACKs and its variants) increase the bandwidth but also improve the accuracy of bandwidth estimators developed by other researchers. The empirical observations reported in this paper are based on an in-vivo experiment in the Internet. Over a 6-month period, we logged the micro dynamics of random connections between a set of selected hosts. These results are encouraging for the developer of a network-aware application since they provide evidence that a simple widening of the interface between applications and network (protocol) may provide the information that allows an application to successfully adapt to changes in resource availability.},

volume={3},

pages={1310-1319 vol.3},
abstract={High latency and loss rates in the Internet make it difficult to stream audio and video without introducing a large playback delay. To address these problems, we propose a prefix caching technique whereby a proxy stores the initial frames of popular clips. Upon receiving a request for the stream, the proxy initiates transmission to the client and simultaneously requests the remaining frames from the server. In addition to hiding the delay, throughput, and loss effects of a weaker service model between the server and the proxy, this novel yet simple prefix caching technique aids the proxy in performing workahead smoothing into the client playback buffer. By transmitting large frames in advance of each burst, workahead smoothing substantially reduces the peak and variability of the network resource requirements along the path from the proxy to the client. We describe how to construct a smooth transmission schedule, based on the size of the prefix, smoothing, and playback buffers, without increasing client playback delay. Experiments with MPEG traces show how a few megabytes of buffer space at the proxy can substantially reduce the bandwidth requirements of variable-bit-rate video. Drawing on these results, we present guidelines for allocating buffer space for each stream, and how to effectively share buffer and bandwidth resources among multiple clients and streams.},

abstract={The congestion control mechanisms used in TCP have been the focus of numerous studies and have undergone a number of enhancements. However, even with these enhancements, TCP connections still experience alarmingly high loss rates, especially during times of congestion. To alleviate this problem, the IETF is considering active queue management mechanisms, such as random early detection (RED), for deployment in the network. In this paper, we first show that the effectiveness of RED depends, to a large extent, on the appropriate parameterization of the RED queue. We then show that there is no single set of RED parameters that work well under different congestion scenarios. In light of this observation, we propose and experiment with more adaptive RED gateways which self-parameterize themselves based on the traffic mix. The results show that traffic cognizant parameterization of RED gateways can effectively reduce packet loss, while maintaining high link utilizations under a range of network loads.},

pages={1337-1345 vol.3},
abstract={End-to-end congestion control mechanisms have been critical to the robustness and stability of the Internet. Most of today's Internet traffic is TCP, and we expect this to remain so in the future. Thus, having "TCP-friendly" behavior is crucial for new applications. However, the emergence of non-congestion-controlled realtime applications threatens unfairness to competing TCP traffic and possible congestion collapse. We present an end-to-end TCP-friendly rate adaptation protocol (RAP), which employs an additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) algorithm. It is well suited for unicast playback of realtime streams and other semi-reliable rate-based applications. Its primary goal is to be fair and TCP-friendly while separating network congestion control from application-level reliability. We evaluate RAP through extensive simulation, and conclude that bandwidth is usually evenly shared between TCP and RAP traffic. Unfairness to TCP traffic is directly determined by how TCP diverges from the AIMD algorithm. Basic RAP behaves in a TCP-friendly fashion in a wide range of likely conditions, but we also devised a fine-grain rate adaptation mechanism to extend this range further. Finally, we show that deploying RED queue management can result in an ideal fairness between TCP and RAP traffic.},

abstract={This paper describes a mechanism we call "SRED" (stabilized random early drop). Like RED (random early detection) SRED pre-emptively discards packets with a load-dependent probability when a buffer in a router in the Internet or an intranet seems congested. SRED has an additional feature that over a wide range of load levels helps it stabilize its buffer occupation at a level independent of the number of active connections. SRED does this by estimating the number of active connections or flows. This estimate is obtained without collecting or analyzing state information on individual flows. The same mechanism can be used to identify flows that may be misbehaving, i.e. are taking more than their fair share of bandwidth. Since the mechanism is statistical in nature, the next step must be to collect state information of the candidates for "misbehaving", and to analyze that information. We show that candidate rows thus identified indeed have a high posterior probability of taking a larger than average amount of bandwidth.},

abstract={Cellular transmission standards such as GSM and IS-54 produce data streams with varying degrees of significance at the source encoder level. We propose an unequal error protection scheme based on a non-uniform signal set which provides the more important data with a preferential Euclidean distance. The unequal error protection is partly accomplished by the modulator in contrast to the conventional systems where the channel encoder is solely responsible. The coding gain resulting from the asymmetric modulation can be translated into a reduction in the complexity of the channel encoder; specifically a reduction by more than half in the number of encoder states can be expected. We study the interaction between the code complexity and the modulation asymmetry in quantitative terms. For differentially coherent systems, a /spl pi//6-shifted differential embedded QPSK is proposed. Decentralizing the bit protection culminates in an extra degree of freedom which in turn introduces more flexibility into the system design.},

pages={1377-1384 vol.3},
abstract={This paper presents a mobile tracking scheme that exploits the predictability of user mobility patterns in wireless PCS networks. Instead of the constant velocity fluid-flow or the random-walk mobility model, a more realistic Gauss-Markov model is introduced, where a mobile's velocity is correlated in time to a various degree. Based on the Gauss-Markov model, a mobile's future location is predicted by the network based on the information gathered from the mobile's last report of location and velocity. When a call is made, the network pages the destination mobile at and around the predicted location of the mobile and in the order of descending probability until the mobile is found. A mobile shares the same prediction information with the network and reports its new location whenever it reaches some threshold distance away from the predicted location. We describe an analytical framework to evaluate the cost of mobility management for the proposed predictive distance-based scheme. We then compare this cost against that of the regular, non-predictive distance-based scheme, which is obtained through simulations. Performance advantage of the proposed scheme is demonstrated under various mobility and call patterns, update cost, page cost, and frequencies of mobile location inspections.},

abstract={Schemes based on the tagging of packets have been proposed as a low-cost way to augment the single class best effort service model of the current Internet by including some kind of service discrimination. Such schemes have a number of attractive features, however, it is not clear exactly what kind of service they would provide to applications. Yet quantifying such service is very important to understand the benefits and drawbacks of the different tagging schemes and of the mechanisms in each scheme (for example how much RED with input and output (RIO) contributes in the assured scheme), and to tackle key performance and economic issues (e.g. the difference in tariff between different service classes would presumably depend on the difference in performance between the classes). The goal in this paper is to obtain a quantitative description of the service provided by tagging schemes. Specifically, we describe and solve simple analytic models of two previously proposed schemes, namely the assured service scheme and the premium service scheme. We obtain expressions for performance measures that characterize the service provided to tagged packets, the service provided to non-tagged packets, and the fraction of tagged packets that do not get the better service they were supposed to. We use these expressions, as well as simulations and experiments from actual implementations, to illustrate the benefits and shortcomings of the schemes.},

abstract={This paper concerns the design of distributed algorithms for sharing network bandwidth resources among contending flows. The classical fairness notion is the so-called max-min fairness; Kelly (see Europ. Trans. Telecom. vol.8 p.33-37, 1997) has previously introduced the alternative proportional fairness criterion; we introduce a third criterion, which is naturally interpreted in terms of the delays experienced by ongoing transfers. We prove that fixed size window control can achieve fair bandwidth sharing according to any of these criteria, provided scheduling at each link is performed in an appropriate manner. We next consider a distributed random scheme where each traffic source varies its sending rate randomly, based on binary feedback information from the network. We show how to select the source behaviour so as to achieve an equilibrium distribution concentrated around the considered fair rate allocations. This stochastic analysis is then used to assess the asymptotic behaviour of deterministic rate adoption procedures.},

abstract={Networks that support multiple services through "link-sharing" must address the fundamental conflicting requirement between isolation among service classes to satisfy each class' quality of service requirements, and statistical sharing of resources for efficient network utilization. While a number of service disciplines have been devised which provide mechanisms to both isolate flows and fairly share excess capacity, admission control algorithms are needed which exploit the effects of inter-class resource sharing. In this paper, we develop a framework of using statistical service envelopes to study inter-class statistical resource sharing. We show how this service envelope enables a class to over-book resources beyond its deterministically guaranteed capacity by statistically characterizing the excess service available due to fluctuating demands of other service classes. We apply our techniques to several multi-class schedulers, including generalized processor sharing, and design new admission control algorithms for multi-class link-sharing environments. We quantify the utilization gains of our approach with a set of experiments using long traces of compressed video.},

abstract={The problem of fair bandwidth sharing among adaptive (TCP) and non-adaptive (i.e. CBR-UDP) flows at an Internet gateway is considered. An algorithm that drops packet preventively, in an attempt to actively penalize the non-adaptive traffic that attempts to "steal" buffer space, and therefore bandwidth from the adaptive traffic flows, is presented. The algorithm maintains minimal flow state information and is therefore scalable. The performance of the algorithm is compared with other gateway algorithms and it is shown that, in the presence of non-adaptive traffic, it achieves a more balanced bandwidth allocation among the different flows. The behavior of a flow subjected to the given algorithm has also been analysed in detail.},

pages={1421-1428 vol.3},
abstract={Wire-speed IP (Internet Protocol) routers require very fast routing table lookup for incoming IP packets. The routing table lookup operation is time consuming because the part of an IP address used in the lookup, i.e., the network address portion, is variable in length. This paper describes the routing table lookup algorithm used in a cluster-based parallel IP router project called Suez. The innovative aspect of this algorithm is its ability to use CPU caching hardware to perform routing table caching and lookup directly by carefully mapping IP addresses to virtual addresses. By running a detailed simulation model that incorporates the performance effects of the CPU memory hierarchy against a packet trace collected from a major network router, we show that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm can reach 87.87 million lookups per second for a 500-MHz Alpha processor with a 16-KByte L1 cache and a 1-MByte L2 cache. This result is one to two orders of magnitude faster than previously reported results on software-based routing table lookup implementations. This paper also reports the performance impacts of various architectural parameters in the proposed scheme and its storage costs, together with the measurements of an implementation of the proposed scheme on a Pentium-II machine running Linux.},

volume={3},

pages={1429-1436 vol.3},
abstract={One of the key design issues for the new generation IP routers is the route lookup mechanism. For each incoming IP packet, the IP routing requires to perform a longest prefix matching on the address lookup in order to determine the packet's next hop. This paper presents a fast route lookup mechanism that only needs tiny SRAM and can be implemented in a pipelined skill in hardware. Based on the proposed scheme, the forwarding table is tiny enough to fit in SRAM with very low cost. For example, a large routing table with 40,000 routing entries can be compacted to a forwarding table of 450-470 Kbytes. In the worst case, the number of memory accesses for a lookup is three. When implemented in a pipeline skill in hardware, the proposed mechanism can achieve one routing lookup every memory access. With current 10 ns SRAM, this mechanism furnishes approximately 100 million routing lookups per second. This is much faster than any current commercially available routing lookup schemes.},

The target of the framework is to allow for resource discovery of both controllable elements and available control points in the these elements as well as real-time control. All this is done in scalable and secure way based on IP-multicast and asymmetric cryptography. The presented framework is also independent of the underlying transport mechanism to allow for flexibility and easy deployment.

title={Adaptive FEC-based error control for Internet telephony},
year={1999},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1453-1460 vol.3},
abstract={Excessive packet loss rates can dramatically decrease the audio quality perceived by users of Internet telephony applications. Previous results suggest that error control schemes using forward error correction (FEC) are good candidates for decreasing the impact of packet loss on audio quality. However, the FEC scheme must be coupled to a rate control scheme. Furthermore, the amount of redundant information used at any given point in time should also depend on the characteristics of the loss process at that time (it would make no sense to send much redundant information when the channel is loss free), on the end to end delay constraints (destination typically have to wait longer to decode the FEC as more FEC information is used), on the quality of the redundant information, etc. However, it is not clear given all these constraints how to choose the "best" possible redundant information. We address this issue, and illustrate the approach using an FEC scheme for packet audio standardized in the IETF. We show that the problem of finding the best redundant information can be expressed mathematically as a constrained optimization problem for which we give explicit solutions. We obtain from these solutions a simple algorithm with very interesting features, namely (i) the algorithm optimizes a subjective measure (such as the audio quality perceived at a destination) as opposed to an objective measure of quality (such as the packet loss rate at a destination), (ii) it incorporates the constraints of rate control and playout delay adjustment schemes, and (iii) it adapts to varying loss conditions in the network (estimated online with RTCP feedback). We have been using the algorithm, together with a TCP-friendly rate control scheme and we have found it to provide very good audio quality even over paths with high and varying loss rates. We present simulation and experimental results to illustrate its performance.},

Ever increasing load on the Internet has made it essential to design services that are fast, reliable, easily manageable, transparent to access, and that can scale gracefully with load. A common way of achieving this has been replicating services across multiple servers and redirecting clients to different servers depending upon various criteria. Existing schemes are either entirely server or network based. This scheme involves the client network layer actively in redirection. The paper describes the redirection protocol in detail and a FreeBSD based implementation of a testbed. The performance of the mechanism is measured by experiments on the testbed and analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of client based network level redirection are discussed and some useful applications that it enables are described.},

Distributed synchronization and dead reckoning are the main elements of this transmission control infrastructure. These mechanisms have been implemented in a fully distributed, multiplayer game application, i.e., one in which each entity in a game session computes its own local view of the session. The role of each entity is consequently to periodically send its own state to all other session participants (using RTP/UDP/IP multicast) and to periodically compute its own local view of the global game state using information received from the other participants. A detailed experimental analysis is provided using MBone and LAN experiments. We investigate how the "quality" of the game is influenced by the frequency at which players exchange state information, as well as by network impairments such as packet loss and transmission delay.},

abstract={In this paper we present methods to evaluate the benefit of using direct ATM connections (shortcuts) between IP nodes in IP over ATM networks, and we identify the combinations of IP and ATM network topologies where ATM shortcut benefits are likely to be high. We model an IP/ATM network with and without ATM shortcuts as two loss networks. We propose a metric for network performance comparison, the network load ratio, that gives the ratio of the number of flows accepted by two networks at the same network blocking probability. We derive an estimator of this metric, the asymptotic load ratio, that has low computational complexity. This estimator forms the basis of a methodology for network performance comparison. We use this method in simulation experiments using random networks. These experiments indicate that in many cases the utilization of an IP/ATM network increases proportionally to the decrease in the average path length when ATM shortcuts are used. We have also found that there is almost no correlation between the increase in network utilization (when using ATM shortcuts) and the IP to ATM node ratio.},

The study based on the real Internet/intranet traces shows that even at high cost with long delay for each shortcut setup, MPOA can offer significant performance gain over the traditional routed network in an inter ELAN communication environment. In comparison, the MPOA performance gain in an Internet backbone environment is much less significant, mainly because of the dominant short-lived flows contributed by both d.n.s. and h.t.t.p. applications. We also propose a flow classification algorithm, which substantially reduces the implementation complexity while achieves the same level of performance as compared to the default flow classification algorithm proposed by MPOA standard. A simple timeout mechanism is also introduced to the flow cache table management for significant performance improvement. We further develop a stable, adaptive flow classification algorithm, which achieves a near-optimal solution to minimize the constrained MPOA resource utilizations.},

abstract={Multi-protocol over ATM (MPOA) is being considered by the industry as an important short-cut technology that provides an efficient transfer of inter-subnet unicast data in a LANE environment. MPOA was initially considered to carry backbone traffic in the enterprise or campus networks. However, congestion in the public Internet provokes many to consider MPOA as a solution for the carrier or service provider networks as well. In this paper, we investigate the scalability issues of MPOA in the wide area network environment. We use a realistic simulation model driven by real Internet traffic to study crucial metrics such as the SVC setup rate, the number of VCs required, and the percentage of packets switched. We find that MPC ingress cache size provides a three-way trade-off among the percentage of switched packets, the VC usage and the SVC setup rate requirement. We also find that the SVC setup rate is linearly dependent on the packet arrival rate.},

pages={1513-1521 vol.3},
abstract={Previous measurements of various types of network traffic have shown evidence consistent with long-range dependence and self-similarity. However, an alternative explanation for these measurements is non-stationarity. Standard estimators of LRD parameters such as the Hurst parameter H assume stationarity and are susceptible to bias when this assumption does not hold. Hence LRD may be indicated by these estimators when none is present, or alternatively LRD taken to be non-stationarity. The Abry-Veitch (see IEEE Trans. on on Info. Theory, vol.44, no.1, p.2-15, 1998) joint estimator has much better properties when a time-series is non-stationary. In particular the effect of polynomial trends in data may be intrinsically eliminated from the estimates of LRD parameters. This paper investigates the behavior of the AV estimator when there are non-stationarities in the form of a level shift in the mean and/or the variance of a process. We examine cases where the change occurs both gradually or as a single jump discontinuity, and also examine the effect of the size of the shift. In particular we show that although a jump discontinuity may cause bins in the estimates of the H, the bias is negligible except when the jump is sharp, and large compared with the standard deviation of the process. We explain these effects and suggest how any introduced errors might be minimized. We define a broad class of non-stationary LRD processes so that LRD remains well defined under time varying mean and variance. The results are tested by applying the estimator to a real data set which contains a clear non-stationary event falling within this class.},

For a queuing node with the maximum allowable queuing delay d/sub max/, it is quantitatively shown that peak rate of the input traffic filtered (smoothed) with the averaging period of 200d/sub max/ captures more than 80% of the effective bandwidth when traffic aggregation and flow/connection dynamics are considered.},

abstract={In measurement based admission control, measured traffic parameters are used determine the maximum number of connections which can be admitted to a resource within a given quality constraint. It has been pointed out that the certainty equivalent formulation, in which the measured parameters are assumed to be the true ones, can compromise admission control. This is because the measured parameters are themselves random quantities, and so contribute additional variability to the attained quality. This paper analyzes the asymptotic sampling properties of admission controllers that use effective bandwidth estimation in a large deviation setting. This analysis applies to both bufferless and buffered resources; in the many sources asymptotic and in the large buffer asymptotic.},

abstract={We propose a time-scale decomposition approach to measurement-based admission control (MBAC). We identify a critical time-scale T/spl tilde//sub h/ such that: (1) aggregate traffic fluctuation slower than T/spl tilde//sub h/ can be tracked by the admission controller and compensated for by flow admissions and departures; (2) fluctuations faster than T/spl tilde//sub h/ have to be absorbed by reserving spare bandwidth on the link. The critical time-scale is shown to scale as T/sub h///spl radic/n, where T/sub h/ is the average flow duration and n is the size of the link in terms of number of flows it can carry. A MBAC design is presented which filters aggregate measurements into low and high frequency components separated at the cutoff frequency 1/T/spl tilde//sub h/, using the low frequency component to track slow time-scale traffic fluctuations and the high frequency component to estimate the spare bandwidth needed. The analysis shows that the scheme achieves high utilization and is robust to traffic heterogeneity, multiple time-scale fluctuations and measurement errors. The scheme uses only measurements of aggregate bandwidth and does not need to keep track of per-flow information.},

These types of networks are becoming more prevalent due to the growing penetration of hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and asymmetric digital subscriber loop (ADSL) systems, in the last mile or local loop. Consequently, it is important to understand and quantify the effect that asymmetry has on the performance of TCP applications. We study the effect of varying the upstream buffer size on TCP performance. We characterize the maximum achievable throughput as a function of the number of upstream buffers, and also compute the minimum downstream buffer size required to achieve full link throughput.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the stationary behavior of the TCP congestion window performing ideal congestion avoidance when the packet loss probability is not constant, but varies as a function of the window size. By neglecting the detailed window behavior during fast recovery, we are able to derive a Markov process that is then approximated by a continuous-time, continuous state space process. The stationary distribution of this process is analyzed and derived numerically and then extrapolated to obtain the stationary distribution of the TCP window. This numerical analysis enables us to predict the behavior of the TCP congestion window when interacting with a router port performing early random drop (or random early detection) where the loss probability varies with the queue occupancy.},

abstract={Hosts providing important network services such as HTTP and FTP incur a per-connection memory load from TCP that can adversely affect their connection rate and throughput. The memory requirement is directly tied to the number of connections; caching and other sharing methods will not alleviate it. We have observed HTTP throughput reductions of as much as 50% under SunOS 4.1.3 due to this loading. This paper advocates off-loading the memory requirements to the growing number of clients. This reduces server memory requirements as connection rate at that server grows due to increases in the number of clients and the bandwidth available on the network. These approaches control server memory load better with growing client load than per-transaction techniques such as persistent HTTP connections. These approaches also interoperate with persistent connections to take advantage of their other benefits. This paper describes the causes of the memory loading, called TIME-WAIT loading, and defines three methods of alleviating it that scale with increasing number of clients. We present measurements of the systems and a comparison of their properties.},

pages={415-422 vol.2},
abstract={This paper has two main contributions. First the extremely high latency of the GSM link is revealed which through measurements is determined to have a magnitude usually only known from satellite links. This greatly impacts the link configuration time of packet framing protocols for serial links like the point-to-point protocol (PPP). The key idea of the proposed solution-Quickstart-PPP-is to break the strict sequential order of the different signalling phases while ensuring that protocol semantics are not violated and interoperability with existing PPP implementations is preserved. As a result the link configuration delay can be completely eliminated. The second contribution uncovers a fundamental problem which is that the GSM circuit-switched data service is not capable of satisfying different reliability requirements simultaneously. More precisely it is not possible to use applications requiring the GSM link to operate in reliable mode together with loss-tolerant but delay-sensitive applications at the same time. The developed solution-Link Sniffer-suggests a mechanism that can be added to the implementation of GSM's reliable link layer protocol which allows to "sniff" on packet headers to determine the reliability mode to be used. The key advantage of this solution is that the link layer protocol itself does not have to be changed.},

abstract={Networks have increased rapidly both in scale and speed. Problems related to the control and management are of increasing interest. The average throughput and end-to-end delay of a network flow are important design factors. However, there is no satisfactory tool to obtain such parameters. The traditional packet-by-packet event driven simulation is slow when the network speed is high. The time driven simulation faces the difficulty of choosing the right time interval when simulating packet-switched networks. As the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the most widely used transport layer protocol, and it uses a window based flow control mechanism, classic queuing theories involving Markov chain assumptions are not applicable. This paper describes a model for window based flow control packet-switched networks. The model attempts to provide a way to obtain the steady state results for large and high speed networks using TCP. We discuss in detail the construction, implementation and application of the model. This paper also compares the results obtained from the model with those from the packet-by-packet event driven simulation. The comparison shows the model is correctly modeling the networks.},

volume={2},

pages={431-438 vol.2},
abstract={Congestion control of Internet best effort traffic relies mostly on TCP window flow control of individual sessions. This paper argues that such approach does not scale well to a very large number of simultaneously active flows, typical of backbones characterized by large delay-bandwidth products. In this scenario, the TCP window sizes tend to be small and dropping or marking packets alone is not effective to reduce the offered traffic. The analysis presented describes the aggressive TCP dynamics under many flows and suggests that the performance can be improved by applying back-pressure flow control to the aggregate traffic in the backbone. To demonstrated this argument, a link-layer, rate-based, back-pressure mechanism for IP-over-ATM backbones using the ABR service is described. A simulation study of a network with this capability demonstrates the improvement of TCP performance under many flows. The study also considers RED and ECN routers to indicate that these techniques alone are not well positioned to address the many flows scenario either. However, the combination of random early detection (RED) and explicit congestion notification (ECN) routers with back-pressure has the potential to further improve TCP performance.},

title={An effective and efficient traffic smoothing scheme for delivery of online VBR media streams},
year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={447-454 vol.2},
abstract={Traffic smoothing for delivery of online VBR media streams is one of the most important problems in designing multimedia systems. Given available client buffer and a window-sliding size, conventional approaches try to reduce bandwidth allocated in each window. However, they can not lead to the minimization of bandwidth allocated for transmitting the entire stream. Although a window-sliding approach was introduced previously to further reduce the bandwidth allocated, it was computational costly. In this paper, an effective and efficient online traffic-smoothing scheme is proposed. Different from the conventional static window-sliding approaches, this approach dynamically decides the suitable window-sliding size to online smooth the bursty traffic. Then, an aggressive workahead scheme is applied in transmitting the entire stream. By examining different media streams, the approach has a small bandwidth, high bandwidth utilization and small computation cost. Considering the online transmission of a Star War movie, our approach result is 13% less for the bandwidth and 4% less for the network idle rate than SLWIN(1). Comparing the number of window sliding, our approach is 75% less than SLWIN(1). The relations between the characteristic of the input traffic and the behavior of obtained scheduling results are discussed. Finally, an extension of the proposed approach to resolve the latency and quality tolerance applications is also introduced.},

title={Optimal multicast smoothing of streaming video over an internetwork},
year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={455-463 vol.2},
abstract={A number of applications such as internet video broadcasts, corporate telecasts, distance learning etc. require transmission of streaming video to multiple simultaneous users across an internetwork. The high bandwidth requirements coupled with the multi-timescale burstiness of compressed video make it a challenging problem to provision network resources for transmitting streaming multimedia. For such applications to become affordable and ubiquitous, it is necessary to develop scalable techniques which can efficiently deliver streaming video to multiple heterogeneous clients across a heterogeneous internetwork. We propose using multicasting of smoothed video and differential caching of the video at intermediate nodes in the distribution tree, as techniques for reducing the network bandwidth requirements of such dissemination. We formulate the multicast smoothing problem, and develop an algorithm for computing the set of optimally smoothed transmission schedules for the tree (such that the transmission schedule along each link in the tree has the lowest peak rate and rate variability for any feasible transmission schedule for that link) given a buffer allocation to the different nodes in the tree. We also develop an algorithm to compute the minimum total buffer allocation to the entire tree and the corresponding allocation to each node, such that feasible transmission is possible to all the clients, when the tree has heterogeneous rate constraints. MPEG-2 trace-driven performance evaluations indicate that there are substantial benefits from multicast smoothing and differential caching. For example, the optimal multicast smoothing can reduce the total transmission bandwidth requirements in the distribution tree by more than a factor of 3 as compared to multicasting the unsmoothed stream.},

pages={464-471 vol.2},
abstract={We consider designing near video on demand (VoD) systems that minimize start-up latency while maintaining high image quality. Recently non-uniform segmentation has been used to develop periodic broadcasting techniques for near VoD. These techniques give significant reductions in start-up latency as compared with more conventional uniform segmentation. All of these schemes assume, however, that the videos are CBR-encoded. Since a CBR-encoded video has a larger average rate than an open-loop VBR encoding with the same image quality, there is potential to obtain further performance improvements by using VBR video. In this paper we develop a series of multiplexing schemes for the periodic broadcasting of VBR-encoded video, which are based on smoothing, server buffering and client prefetching. Two key but conflicting performance measures exist when using VBR video: latency and packet loss. By introducing small additional delays in our multiplexing schemes, our traced-based numerical work shows that the schemes can achieve nearly 100% link utilization with negligible packet loss. When the ratio of the CBR rate to the VBR average rate is a modest 1.8, start-up latency can be reduced by a factor of four or more for common scenarios.},

pages={472-479 vol.2},
abstract={Video delivery from a server to a client across a network is an important component of many multimedia applications. While delivering a video stream across a resource constrained network, loss of frames may be unavoidable. Under such circumstances, it is desirable to find a server transmission schedule that can efficiently utilize the network resources while maximizing the perceived quality-of-service (QoS) at the client. To address this issue, we introduce the notion of selective frame discard at the server and formulate the optimal selective frame discard problem using a QoS based cost function. Given network bandwidth and client buffer constraints, we develop an O(N log N) algorithm to find the minimum number of frames that must be discarded in order to meet these constraints. The correctness of the algorithm is also formally established. Since the computational complexity of the optimal algorithm for solving the optimal selective frame discard problem is prohibitively high in general, we also develop several efficient heuristic algorithms for selective frame discard. These algorithms are evaluated using JPEG video traces.},

pages={480-490 vol.2},
abstract={We consider the resource allocation problem in the design of intranets or virtual private networks (VPNs) that is faced by a service provider, which has service level agreements with various customers to carry their multiservice traffic. The design allocates bandwidth on each link to the VPNs such that, when the traffic of a customer is optimally routed over its VPN, a weighted aggregate measure of carried bandwidth over the service provider's infrastructure is maximized, subject to constraints that each VPN carries a specified minimum. Multiplexing is across services and routes within each VPN, but not across VPNs. The traffic modelling is at the flow or call level, with random arrivals and holding times of calls and each call requiring (effective) bandwidth, which is characteristic of the call's service type, on all links in its route. The network is modelled as a multirate loss network. Scalability of the design process, i.e., the ability to handle OC3 and higher rates, is an important contribution, and this is achieved by the systematic use of a refined uniform asymptotic approximation. Our software package VPN DESIGNER incorporates these results. We report on numerical results for problems with up to 8 VPNs on a network with 8 nodes, 24 OC3 links, 5 services and up to 640 routes.},

We prove that the algorithm provides a VP network topology that is asymptotically optimal with respect to both connectivity and the diameter of the network. These optimality properties are combined with algorithmic simplicity and polynomial running time, thus overcoming the notorious "optimality vs. scalability" dilemma. This result is made possible by applying the theory of random graphs to this type of networks. This theory has the methodological advantage of increased accuracy with growing network size, thus turning the "curse of dimensionality" into a blessing. Therefore, the paper exemplifies that the theory of random graphs, beyond supporting analysis purposes, may serve as a useful tool in the design of algorithms that overcome the "scalability bottleneck", a problem that prevents current approaches from finding near-optimal solutions as today's networks grow in size and complexity.},

abstract={We investigate the problem of virtual path (VP) capacity allocation in a decentralized way. Users (VP controllers), sharing common network resources, are assumed to control their VP capacities according to their performance measures. We formulate a model that differs from previous ones in two points: first, each user has its own performance objective that is simply assumed to be concave and smooth; second, a user's strategy (VP bandwidth reservation) is constrained between two numbers. Adopting a standard game-theoretic formulation, we prove that there exists a unique network operating point-Nash equilibrium. We show several interesting properties of the equilibrium and also look at the convergence of some distributed algorithms. After studying the combined problem of routing and flow control in parallel link networks, we investigate the problem of VP capacity allocation in general topology networks, where fixed routing is assumed. Finally, examples of the model are presented.},

abstract={We consider the problem of obtaining non-trivial lower bounds on the the lost revenue under any routing and admission control scheme in a multi-class loss network. First, we use the following simple idea to bound the performance of any coordinate-convex admission policy on a single link: the blocking probability of any call class is lower bounded by considering just this class in isolation and replacing the available bandwidth (a random quantity) by its mean. Then, following the methods of Kelly (1994) and Gibbens and Kelly (see IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, p.100-10, 1995), we use this single link bound to obtain linear programs which give bounds in the case of sparsely-connected networks with multiple bandwidth classes and alternate routing.},

title={Techniques for optimizing CORBA middleware for distributed embedded systems},
year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={513-521 vol.2},
abstract={The distributed embedded systems industry is poised to leverage emerging real-time operating systems, such as Inferno Windows CE, EPOC, and Palm OS to support mobile communication applications, such as electronic mail, Internet browsing, and network management. Ideally, these applications can be developed using standard middleware components like CORBA to improve their quality and reduce their cost and cycle time. However, stringent constraints on memory available in embedded systems imposes a severe limit on the footprint of CORBA middleware. This paper provides three contributions to the study and design of small footprint, embedded CORBA middleware. First, we describe the optimizations used to develop the protocol engine and CORBA IDL compiler provided by TAO, which is our real-time CORBA implementation. TAO's IDL compiler produces stubs that can use either compiled and/or interpretive marshalling. Second, we compare the performance and footprint of TAO IDL compiler-generated stubs and skeletons that use compiled and/or interpretive marshalling for a wide range of IDL data types. Third, we illustrate the benefits of the small footprint and efficiency of TAO IDL compiler-generated stubs and skeletons for CORBA object services implemented using TAO. The results comparing the performance of the compiled and interpretive stubs and skeletons indicate that the interpretive stubs and skeletons perform between 75-100% of the compiled stubs and skeletons for a wide range of data types. However the code size for the interpreted stubs and skeletons was between 26-45% and 50-80% of the compiled stubs and skeletons, respectively. These results indicate a positive step towards implementing high performance, small footprint middleware for distributed embedded systems.},

title={A signaling protocol for structured resource allocation},
year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={522-533 vol.2},
abstract={There is an emerging class of multi-party, multimedia, multi-flow applications that have a high-level structure that imposes dependencies between resource allocations for flows within the application. These applications are also capable of making intelligent decisions on how resource allocation should be controlled within the application. The development of such applications places new requirements on signaling protocols. This paper outlines these new requirements, discusses ways in which they can be supported and presents the design and implementation of an experimental signaling protocol that supports these requirements. This paper makes the case that for these structured applications, there is an advantage to allocating the resources in an integrated fashion, i.e. computation, storage and communication resources for all the flows are allocated at the same time in a coordinated fashion. The concept of a virtual mesh is introduced as a key abstraction that encapsulates the set of resources that are allocated and managed in an integrated fashion to meet the needs of applications. The paper presents two mesh setup algorithms and a performance evaluation comparing them. Temporal resource sharing within the virtual mesh is discussed in detail and signaling support for temporal sharing at setup and runtime is examined. It is important to characterize temporal sharing since it can significantly reduce the resource requirements for applications. We have implemented the Beagle signaling protocol that supports this integrated resource management model. Beagle representations and mechanisms for mesh setup and temporal sharing are described and a prototype implementation is presented.},

volume={2},

pages={534-542 vol.2},
abstract={Copy avoidance techniques for network I/O often assume that server buffers are ephemeral (i.e., are deallocated as soon as I/O processing completes). Such techniques cannot be used for file I/O, where buffers may need to be cached long-term. Mapped file I/O, however, can easily provide copy avoidance for cached server buffers. This paper demonstrates experimentally that mapped file I/O interoperates correctly with emulated copy, a previously proposed copy avoidance scheme for ephemeral server buffers. The resulting solution allows data to be passed between networks and file systems without copying and without changing existing interfaces. Greatest benefits are obtained when copying is avoided both in network and file I/O. Two new optimizations are contributed: header patching, for stripping packet headers and restoring page alignment without hardware support; and user-directed page swapping, for passing data between regions without copying. These optimizations are useful also for network I/O with operating system bypass or with noncopy semantics.},

year={1999},
volume={2},

pages={543-550 vol.2},
abstract={We present a new transport protocol called HPF for effectively supporting heterogeneous packet flows in the Internet environment. The following are the key features of HPF: HPF supports packet flows where different packets in the same transport connection have different quality-of service requirements in term of reliability, priority, and deadlines. HPP supports application-level framing, and provides APIs for applications to specify the priority, reliability and timing requirements of each frame. HPF enables the use of application-specified priorities as hints for network routers to preferentially drop low-priority packets during congestion. This ensures that 'important data' gets through preferentially during congestion. HPF decouples the congestion control and reliability mechanisms in order to support congestion control for unreliable and heterogeneous packet flows. Preliminary performance measurements in our experimental testbed show that HPF can provide effective support for heterogeneous packet flows in the presence of dynamic network resources.},

abstract={In this paper we study the cell loss asymptotics for finite buffers accessed by a large number of stationary independent sources and which are served according to a strict HOL priority rule. We first consider the case of two buffers with one of them having strict priority over the other and we obtain asymptotically exact expressions for the cell loss probability for the queues. The asymptotics are studied in terms of a scaling parameter which reflects the server speed, buffer size and the number of sources in such a way that the ratios remain constant. Moreover, as in the single queue case the results are valid for long-range dependent sources with bounded instantaneous rates. The results are then generalised to the case of M buffers where it is shown that resource pooling takes place by which all higher order priority queues can be lumped together when calculating the asymptotics of the lowest priority queue. We conclude with some numerical validation of our formulae against simulations which confirm the theory.},

abstract={For pre-orchestrated multimedia documents, the important QoS parameters are bandwidth, jitter and reliability. A data network may employ a large number of service disciplines that provide guaranteed QoS. In this paper, we propose a network model, which we call the jitter graph, to capture the bandwidth, jitter and reliability of a large number of service disciplines. The significance of this model is that it abstracts the properties of the network, which allows the design of QoS routing protocols, resource allocation policies, and traffic regulation schemes that are independent of the specific properties of each node. Based on this model, we propose a traffic regulation scheme that reduces, and possibly eliminates, jitter introduced by any service discipline that can be abstracted by the jitter graph network model. The proposed traffic regulation scheme, together with jitter graph model, are analyzed and simulated based on an existing service discipline.},

We extend the work of Privalov and Sohraby (see IEEE/ACM Trans. on Networking, 1998) to a networking environment and provide the end-to-end jitter analysis of feed-forward connection-oriented networks supporting multiplexed CBR connections.

abstract={Distributed channel allocation algorithms have received considerable attention due to their high reliability, and scalability. However, in these algorithms, a borrower needs to consult with its interference neighbors in order to borrow a channel. Thus, a borrower fails to borrow channels when it cannot communicate with anyone of its interference neighbors. In real-life networks, under heavy traffic load, a cell has a large probability to experience an intermittent network congestion or even a communication link failure. In these algorithms, since a cell has to consult with a large number of interference neighbors to borrow a channel. The failure rate will be much higher under heavy traffic load. In this paper, we first propose a fault-tolerant channel acquisition algorithm which tolerates communication link failures and node (MH or MSS) failures. Then, we present a channel selection algorithm and integrate it into the distributed acquisition algorithm. Simulation results show that our algorithm significantly reduces the failure rate under network congestion, communication link failures, and node failures compared to non-fault-tolerant channel allocation algorithms.},

pages={592-600 vol.2},
abstract={A mobile computing system with no fixed nodes is presented. In traditional cellular systems with fixed base stations the channel reuse pattern is static and deterministic. When the cell layout is dynamic, due to the mobility of base stations, the cluster of cells within co-channel interference range changes with time. Consequently, the channel reuse pattern is highly dynamic, Moreover, base stations also need wireless channels to communicate amongst themselves. A communication session between a pair of nodes may have to switch channels due to the movement of other nodes into the neighborhood. Hence, there is a need for new wireless channel allocation algorithms for virtual cellular systems with mobile base stations. In this paper, principles of mutual exclusion pertaining to distributed computing systems are employed to develop such an algorithm. The inter-base station wireless links are referred to as backbone links while the base station-mobile node links are referred to as short-hop links. The proposed algorithm is distributed, dynamic and deadlock free. Disjoint sets of channels are used for backbone and short-hop links. The distributed nature of the channel allocation scheme leads to robustness as the responsibility is no longer centralized at the MTSO. Instead, it is shared among all the mobile base stations. This also makes the algorithm scalable.},

abstract={With the advent of high-speed networks, a single link will carry hundreds or even thousands of applications. This results in a very natural application of the central limit theorem, to model the network traffic by a Gaussian stochastic processes. We study the tail probability P({Q>x}) of a queueing system when the input process is assumed to be a very general class of Gaussian processes which includes a large class of self similar or other types of long-range dependent Gaussian processes. For example, past work on fractional Brownian motion, and variations therein, are but a small subset of the work presented in this paper. This study is based on extreme value theory and we show that log P({Q>x})+m/sub x//2 grows at most on the order of logx, where m/sub x/ corresponds to the reciprocal of the maximum (normalized) variance of a Gaussian process directly related to the aggregate input process. The result is considerably stronger than the existing results in the literature based on large deviation theory, and we theoretically show that this improvement can be quite important in characterizing the asymptotic behavior of P({Q>x}). Through numerical examples, we also demonstrate that exp[-m/sub x//2] provides a very accurate estimate for a variety of long-range and short-range dependent input processes over the entire buffer range.},

This has important design implications suggesting that negligible increases of the buffer size in certain buffer regions can decrease the overflow probabilities by order of magnitudes. A problem of this type arises quite frequently in practice when the arrival process distribution has a bounded support and inside that support it is nicely matched with a heavy-tailed distribution (e.g. Pareto). However, the primary interest in this scenario is in its possible application to controlling heavy-tailed traffic flows. More precisely, one can imagine a network control procedure in which short network flows are separated from long ones. If the distribution of flows is heavy-tailed this procedure will yield a truncated heavy-tailed distribution for the short network flows. Intuitively, it can be expected that with short flows one can obtain much better multiplexing gains than with the original ones (before the separation). Indeed, the analysis confirms this expectation.},

abstract={In this paper we derive an expression for the asymptotics of the buffer length distribution of a discrete-time infinite capacity single server queue with deterministic service time and its input process belonging to a class of long range dependent discrete-time M/G//spl infin/ processes. This class of arrival process is defined as follows. At each time slot sequences of back-to back customers are generated according to a Poisson distribution with parameter X. The length of such a sequence is assumed to asymptotically behave like a Pareto distribution with parameter s, i.e. the probability that a sequence consists of k customers is given by ck/sup -3/ for k/spl rarr//spl infin/, with c>0 and 2<s<3. Due to the heavy tail of the members of this class of distributions, the presented class of M/G//spl infin/ processes has the long range dependence property (i.e., the autocorrelation function decays as a power of the lag time). We show that in this case the asymptotic behavior of the tail probabilities of the stationary distribution of the buffer occupancy is given by (/spl lambda/cp/sup s-2//(s-2)(s-1)(1-/spl rho/))n/sup 2-s/ for n/spl rarr//spl infin/, with /spl rho/ representing the load of the system. This result is obtained using a generating function approach and the Tauberian theorem for a power series. Furthermore, an application towards traffic management and simulation results are presented.},

abstract={The bottleneck in many telecommunication systems has often been modeled by an M/G/1 queueing system with priorities. While the probability generating function (PGF) for the occupancy distribution of each traffic class can be readily obtained, the occupancy distributions have been obtainable only rarely. However, the occupancy distribution is of great importance, particularly in those cases where the moments are not all finite. We present a method of obtaining the occupancy distribution from the PGF and demonstrate its validity by obtaining the occupancy distributions for a number of cases, including those with regularly varying service time distributions.},

title={Supporting dynamic inter-class resource sharing: a multi-class QoS routing algorithm},
year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={649-660 vol.2},
abstract={In an integrated services network, resources are shared by multiple traffic classes. Service classes that deliver quality-of-service (QoS) to applications have priority over others that do not. In such a multi-service network, routing decisions for high priority QoS traffic will affect what resources are available for lower priority traffic: poor route selection can result in congestion for, or even starvation of, lower priority traffic. Whereas many studies have focused on routing algorithms that optimize the network throughput for individual service classes, little effort has been devoted to routing algorithms that address inter-class resource sharing. In this paper, we propose a routing algorithm that allows dynamic sharing of link resources among multiple traffic classes. The algorithm is based on the concept of "virtual residual bandwidth", which is derived from the link residual bandwidth by taking the congestion condition of low priority traffic into account. By using the virtual residual bandwidth in the link cost function for QoS sessions, we discourage QoS sessions from using links that are heavily loaded with low priority traffic. Our approach is simple in the sense that besides changing the link cost function, no other changes to the routing algorithms for individual service classes are required. An extensive simulation study shows that when the traffic load is unevenly distributed, significant performance improvements can be achieved for low priority traffic without sacrificing performance for high priority traffic. The result demonstrates that QoS routing is important even when the QoS traffic load is light and call blocking is not an issue.},

title={A new approach to routing with dynamic metrics},
year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={661-670 vol.2},
abstract={We present a new routing algorithm to compute paths within a network using dynamic link metrics. Dynamic link metrics are cost metrics that depend on a link's dynamic state, e.g., the congestion on the link. Our algorithm is destination-initiated: a destination initiates a global path computation to itself using dynamic link metrics. All other destinations that do not initiate this dynamic metric computation use paths that are calculated and maintained by a traditional routing algorithm using static link metrics. Analysis of Internet packet traces show that a high percentage of network traffic is destined for a small number of networks. Because our algorithm is destination-initiated, it achieves maximum performance at minimum cost when it only computes dynamic metric paths to these selected "hot" destination networks. This selective approach to route recomputation reduces many of the problems (principally route oscillations) associated with calculating all routes simultaneously. We compare the routing efficiency and end to-end performance of our algorithm against those of traditional algorithms using dynamic link metrics. The results of our experiments show that our algorithm can provide higher network performance at a significantly lower routing cost under conditions that arise in real networks. The effectiveness of the algorithm stems from the independent, time-staggered recomputation of important paths using dynamic metrics, allowing for splits in congested traffic that cannot be made by traditional routing algorithms.},

abstract={When an ATM node discovers that it cannot continue the setup of a virtual channel under the requested QoS, it initiates a back-tracking procedure called "crankback".

Under the proposed scheme, nodes check during the connection admission control procedure whether the establishment of a virtual channel has a good chance to be admitted over the entire designated route. If this is not the ease, crankback is initiated even before a certain QoS parameter is exceeded.},

year={1999},
volume={2},

pages={689-698 vol.2},
abstract={The Internet provides no support for privacy or authentication of multicast packets. However, an increasing number of applications require secure multicast services in order to restrict group membership and enforce accountability of group members. A major problem associated with the deployment of secure multicast delivery services is the scalability of the key distribution protocol. This is particularly true with regard to the handling of group membership changes, such as member departures and/or expulsions, which necessitate the distribution of a new session key to all the remaining group members. As the frequency of group membership changes increases, it becomes necessary to reduce the cost of key distribution operations. This paper explores the use of batching of group membership changes to reduce the frequency, and hence the cost, of key re-distribution operations. It focuses explicitly on the problem of cumulative member removal and presents an algorithm that minimizes the number of messages required to distribute new keys to the remaining group members. The algorithm is used in conjunction with a new multicast key management scheme which uses a set of auxiliary keys in order to improve scalability. In contrast to previous schemes which generate a fixed hierarchy of keys, the proposed scheme dynamically generates the most suitable key hierarchy by composing different keys. Our cumulative member removal algorithm uses Boolean function minimization techniques, and outperforms all other schemes known to us in terms of message complexity.},

We view this problem as a special case of the more general problem of access control for a service on a network. We present an access control model on which we base our solution. This model has three components: authentication, authorization, and access verification. We describe the design and implementation of a system that allows secure network access through public network ports and wireless LANs. The design requires no special hardware or custom client software, resulting in minimal deployment cost and maintenance overhead. The system has a user-friendly, Web-based interface, offers good security, and scales to a campus-sized community.},

Yet, existing security protocols for multicast offer only partial solutions. We first present a taxonomy of multicast scenarios on the Internet and point out relevant security concerns. Next we address two major security problems of multicast communication: source authentication, and key revocation. Maintaining authenticity in multicast protocols is a much more complex problem than for unicast; in particular, known solutions are prohibitively inefficient in many cases. We present a solution that is reasonable for a range of scenarios. This approach can be regarded as a 'midpoint' between traditional message authentication codes and digital signatures. We also present an improved solution to the key revocation problem.},

abstract={The last couple of years has seen a growing momentum towards using the Internet for conducting business. One of the key enablers for business applications is the ability to setup secure channels across the Internet. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol provides this capability and it is the most widely used transport layer security protocol. In this paper we investigate the performance of SSL both from a latency as well as a throughput point of view. Since SSL is primarily used to secure Web transactions, we use the SPECWeb96 benchmark suitably modified for use with the SSL protocol. We benchmark two of the more popular Web servers that are in use today and find that they are a couple of orders of magnitude slower when it comes to serving secure Web pages. We investigate the reason for this deficiency by instrumenting the SSL protocol stack with a detailed profiling of the protocol processing components. Based on our findings we suggest two modifications to the protocol that reduce the latency as well as increase the throughput at the server.},

abstract={The design of survivable all-optical networks based on self-healing WDM rings (SHR/WDM) to provide 100% protection from any single link failure requires the joint solution of three sub-problems. These are the ring cover of the mesh topology (the RC sub-problem), the routing of working lightpaths between node pairs to support traffic demands (the WL sub-problem) and the selection of the SHR/WDM spare wavelengths for the protection of every link traffic (the SW subproblem). This paper presents an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem of minimizing the total wavelength mileage (/spl lambda/-miles) required to support a set of given traffic demands in a given network topology using SHR/WDM employing 1:N line protection mechanism (the WRL problem). This formulation allows to jointly and optimally solve the three subproblems, and yields up to 15% reduction of the total /spl lambda/-miles required by existing solutions that separately resolve the sub-problems. A simplified sub-optimal solution of the WRL problem is also provided, that yields results few percent worse than the optimal solution and that is tractable for networks whose size is on the order of the pan-European network, i.e., 19 nodes.},

abstract={This paper considers grooming of low speed traffic into high speed lightpaths in a WDM based optical ring with a primary goal of reducing the cost of the entire system, which is dominated by the cost of the SONET transmission equipment connected to the optical ring. The paper attempts to enumerate the architectural options provided by SONET to arrive at a cost-effective solution, including unidirectional path-switched rings (UPSR) and bidirectional line-switched rings (BLSR), use of back-to-back connections between SONET ADMs to reduce the overall cost, and use of different ring speeds (OC-48 and OC-12). To demonstrate each of the architectures, a uniform traffic is considered and its grooming and resulting SONET architecture demonstrated. The paper deviates from earlier approaches which break the problem into two steps: traffic grooming and assignment of lightpaths to rings, in that it looks at the problem as a whole and tries to solve it in a single step. The paper also considers the characteristics of SONET UPSR and BLSR rings and how these affect the grooming. The paper derives lower and upper bounds to these problems for uniform traffic and shows how these improve on known results.},

abstract={This investigation considers optical networks which employ wavelength cross-connects that enable the establishment of wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) channels, between node-pairs. In such and other networks, the failure of a network element (e.g., fiber link, cross-connect, etc.) may cause the failure of several optical channels, thereby leading to large data losses. This study examines different approaches to protect mesh based WDM optical networks from single-link failures. These approaches are based on two basic survivability paradigms: (a) path protection/restoration, and (b) link protection/restoration. In path- and link-protection schemes, backup paths and wavelengths are reserved in advance at the time of call setup. Path- and link-restoration schemes are dynamic schemes in which backup paths are discovered (from the spare capacity in the network) upon the occurrence of a failure. In part 1 of this study presented in this paper, we formulated integer linear programs to determine the capacity requirements for the above protection schemes for a static traffic demand.},

year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={760-767 vol.2},
abstract={Multicast is an efficient paradigm for transmitting data from a sender to a group of receivers. In this paper, we focus on multicast in single channel multi-access wireless local area networks (LANs) comprising several small cells. In such a system, a receiver cannot correctly receive a packet if two or more packets are sent to it at the same time, because the packets "collide". Therefore, one has to ensure that only one node sends at a time. We look at two important issues. First, we consider the problem of the sender acquiring the multi-access channel for multicast transmission. Second, for reliable multicast in each cell of the wireless LAN, we examine ARQ-based approaches. The second issue is important because the wireless link error rates can be very high. We present a new approach to overcome the problem of feedback collision in single channel multi-access wireless LANs, both for the purpose of acquiring the channel and for reliability. Our approach involves the election of one of the multicast group members (receivers) as a "leader" or representative for the purpose of sending feedback to the sender. For reliable multicast, on erroneous reception of a packet, the leader does not send an acknowledgement, prompting a retransmission. On erroneous reception of the packet at receivers other than the leader, our protocol allows negative acknowledgements from these receivers to collide with the acknowledgement from the leader thus destroying the acknowledgement and prompting the sender to retransmit the packet.

pages={768-775 vol.2},
abstract={This paper explores efficient discrete coding techniques that are motivated by the time/energy tradeoff in message transmission between mobile hosts and mobile support stations. Three algorithms are suggested two of which use guessing games in which the mobile support station guesses the message to be transmitted by the mobile host and receives approving signal for successful guess from the mobile host. The first algorithm is designed to achieve the smallest expected amount of energy while obeying a time bound for message transmissions. The second algorithm achieves the shortest expected transmission time while obeying a bound on the energy. This algorithm uses dynamic programming to construct an optimal tree for the guessing game. The third algorithm uses a different approach, approach that is based on the Lempel-Ziv (1978) compression algorithm. The time energy tradeoff is controlled by the choice of the length of the codes used to encode strings in the dictionary. The theoretical results obtained are not tied to mobile computing and are of independent interest.},

year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={784-792 vol.2},
abstract={The Core Assisted Mesh Protocol (CAMP) is introduced for multicast routing in ad hoc networks. CAMP generalizes the notion of core-based trees introduced for internet multicasting into multicast meshes that have much richer connectivity than trees. A shared multicast mesh is defined for each multicast group; the main goal of using such meshes is to maintain the connectivity of multicast groups even while network routers move frequently. CAMP consists of the maintenance of multicast meshes and loop-free packet forwarding over such meshes. Within the multicast mesh of a group, packets from any source in the group are forwarded along the reverse shortest path to the source, just as in traditional multicast protocols based on source-based trees. CAMP guarantees that, within a finite time, every receiver of a multicast group has a reverse shortest path to each source of the multicast group. Multicast packets for a group are forwarded along the shortest paths from sources to receivers defined within the group's mesh. CAMP uses cores only to limit the traffic needed for a router to join a multicast group; the failure of cores does not stop packet forwarding or the process of maintaining the multicast meshes.},

abstract={We consider the stability and performance of a model for networks supporting services that adapt their transmission to the available bandwidth. Not unlike real networks, in our model connection arrivals are stochastic and have a random amount of data to send, so the number of connections in the system changes over time. In turn the bandwidth allocated to, or throughput achieved by, a given connection, may change during its lifetime due to feedback control mechanisms that react to congestion and thus implicitly to the number of ongoing connections. Ideally, for a fixed number of connections, such mechanisms reach an equilibrium typically characterized in terms of its 'fairness' in allocating bandwidth to users, e.g., max-min fair. We prove the stability of such networks when the offered load on each link does not exceed its capacity. We use simulation to investigate the performance, in terms of average connection delays, for various network topologies and fairness criteria. Finally we pose an architectural problem in TCP/IP's decoupling of the transport and network layer from the point of view of guaranteeing connection level stability, which we claim may explain congestion phenomena on the Internet.},

pages={811-818 vol.2},
abstract={This paper re-examines maxmin protocols for ABR traffic in ATM networks in four aspects: convergence, complexity, variations, and performance. First, the concept of "pseudo-saturation" is introduced. Most, if not all, protocols do not properly handle pseudo-saturated links, and as a result, there is no guarantee for convergence to true maxmin solutions. Second, the concept of "constraint precedence graph (CPG)" is introduced and is used to define the best possible time complexity of any maxmin protocol. The existing complexity estimates are overly conservative because they do not consider possible concurrent operations. In contrast, the CPG analysis explicitly accounts for parallelization. Third, the concept of "constraint" is generalized and this generalization is used to derive an optimality condition for the maxmin problem with nonzero minimum cell rate (MCR) requirements. This optimality condition can be used in conjunction with any maxmin protocol to handle the nonzero MCR requirements without adding excessive complexity. Finally, simulations suggest that the complexity analysis is inadequate to gauge protocol performance. A new analysis based on protocol dynamics is called for to understand the performance.},

We consider the case of multiple switches in tandem. We present several definitions of a bottleneck, and provide conditions that determine which queue is the bottleneck. We show that it is not necessarily the queue with the slowest transmission rate that is the first to notify congestion, and that queues with faster transmission rates can increase considerably the congestion. Moreover, a queue may build up in a faster node before it builds in a slower one. We derive analytic formulas for the maximum queue length. We compare our results to those obtained by approximating a network by a simpler one, containing only the bottleneck switch. We show that the maximum queue lengths under the approximating approach may largely underestimate the ones obtained in the real network.},

The routing policy load balances amongst various possible routes between the source and the destinations, basing its decisions on the message queue lengths at the source node. The scheduling amongst various sessions sharing links is devised such that the flow of a session depends on the congestion of the next hop links. MMRS is throughput optimal and computationally simple. It can be implemented in a distributed, asynchronous manner. It has several parameters which can be suitably modified to control the end to end delay, packet loss in a topology specific manner. These parameters can be adjusted to offer limited priorities to some desired sessions. MMRS is expected to play a significant role in end to end congestion control in the multicast scenario.},

pages={837-846 vol.2},
abstract={We propose a flow control scheme for multicast ABR services in ATM networks. At the heart of the proposed scheme is an optimal second-order rate control algorithm, called the /spl alpha/-control, designed to deal with the variation in RM-cell round-trip time (RTT) resulting from dynamic "drift" of the bottleneck in a multicast tree. Applying two-dimensional rate control, the proposed scheme makes the rate process converge to the available bandwidth of the connection's most congested link. It also confines the buffer occupancy to a target regime bounded by a finite buffer capacity. It works well irrespective of the topology of the multicast tree. Using the fluid approximation, we model the proposed scheme and analyze the system dynamics for multicast ABR traffic. We study the convergence properties and derive the optimal control conditions for the /spl alpha/-control. The analytical results show that the scheme is stable and efficient in the sense that both the source rate and bottleneck queue length rapidly converge to a small neighborhood of the designated operating point. We present simulation results which verify the analytical observations. The simulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in dealing with RM-cell RTT and link-bandwidth variations, and in achieving fairness in both buffer and bandwidth occupancies.},

abstract={A key technique for allowing servers to handle a large volume of requests for file transfers is to multicast the data to the set of requesting clients. Typically the paths from the server to the clients will be heterogeneous in bandwidth availability. Multiple-channel multicast (MCM) is an approach that can be used to handle this heterogeneity. In this approach the data is multicast over multiple channels, each addressed as a separate multicast group. Each receiver subscribes to a set of channels (i.e., joins the corresponding multicast groups) commensurate with its own rate capabilities. Of particular interest in the design of MCM schemes is the scheduling of data transmission across the multiple channels to accommodate asynchronous requests from clients. In this paper we present and analyze a new multiple-channel multicast approach called partition organization scheduling. The scheme is designed to result in good reception efficiency when compared to existing proposals while improving on their performance when other measures of interest are considered.},

title={The loss path multiplicity problem in multicast congestion control},
year={1999},

pages={856-863 vol.2},
abstract={An important concern for source-based multicast congestion control algorithms is the loss path multiplicity (LPM) problem that arises because a transmitted packet can be lost on one or more of the many end-to-end paths in a multicast tree. Consequently, if a multicast source's transmission rate is regulated according to loss indications from receivers, the rate may be completely throttled as the number of loss paths increases. In this paper, we analyze a family of additive increase multiplicative decrease congestion control algorithms and show that, unless careful attention is paid to the LPM problem, the average session bandwidth of a multicast session may be reduced drastically as the size of the multicast group increases. This makes it impossible to share bandwidth in a max-min fair manner among unicast and multicast sessions. We show that max-min fairness can be achieved however if every multicast session regulates its rate according to the most congested end-to-end path in its multicast tree. We present an idealized protocol for tracking the most congested path under changing network conditions, and use simulations to illustrate that tracking the most congested path is indeed a promising approach.},

title={An architecture for noncooperative QoS provision in many-switch systems},
year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={864-872 vol.2},
abstract={With the proliferation of high-speed networks and networked services, provisioning differentiated services to a diverse user base with heterogeneous QoS requirements has become an important problem. The traditional approach of resource reservation and admission control provides both guarantees and graded services, however, at the cost of potentially underutilized resources and limited scalability. We describe a WAN QoS provision architecture that adaptively organizes best-effort bandwidth into stratified services with graded QoS properties such that the QoS needs of a diverse user base can be effectively met. This architecture-SBS (stratified best-effort service)-promotes a simple user/simple network realization where neither the user nor the network is burdened with complex computational responsibilities. SBS is scalable, efficient, and adaptive, and it complements the guaranteed service architecture, sharing a common network substrate comprised of GPS routers. It is also a functional complement, provisioning QoS efficiently commensurate with user needs, albeit at the cost of weaker protection. SBS is suited to noncooperative network environments where users behave selfishly and resource contention resolution is mediated by the principle of competitive interaction. A principal feature of SBS is the transformation of user-centric QoS provision mechanisms-a defining characteristic of competitive interaction entailing intimate user control of internal network resources-into network-centric mechanisms while preserving the former's resource allocation paradigm. End-to-end QoS control is facilitated by decentralized control based on Lagrangian optimization-achieve a target end-to-end QoS at minimum cost or resource usage-which, in turn, is amenable to distributed implementation. SBS achieves per-flow QoS control with zero per-flow state at routers and a packet header whose size is independent of hop count. SBS, in spite of foregoing both resource reservation and admission control, is able to provision stable, graded QoS.},

abstract={Communication networks typically provide a basic best-effort service category, in which resources are shared by concurrent users. As no QoS guarantees are provided, a user will submit to best-effort service only if the expected QoS meets some minimal, user-specific, requirements. This results in an inherent conflict of interest among users, which we capture through a dynamic noncooperative game model and investigate its structure and properties. Specifically, we study the operating points of such systems, i.e., their Nash equilibria. First, we investigate the optimal user strategies, which involve a prediction of the evolving system state, and show that they are of the threshold type. We then establish that a Nash equilibrium point exists and is unique. An algorithmic scheme for computing the Nash equilibrium is provided. In practice, rather than making complex predictions, users typically employ simple decision rules, based on what they learn by experience. Interestingly, it can be shown that the Nash equilibrium of the considered system is a stationary point of such learning schemes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the decisions of users which employ such schemes converge to the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we discuss the implications of the study on network design and management.},

abstract={QoS routing mechanisms allow users identify paths that can accommodate their performance requirements and reserve the necessary resources. An important problem is how to conduct such resource allocation efficiently, not only from the single-connection, but also from the network point of view. We propose the use of pricing mechanisms as a means to regulate the users decisions in a networkwide efficient manner. Focusing on QoS architectures that employ rate-based schedulers, we formulate a congestion-based pricing scheme. We establish the structure of the corresponding user-optimal response, i.e., a path selection algorithm that satisfies the user's requirements at minimal cost. We show that the underlying noncooperative game among users has a unique equilibrium, for any particular choice of price functions. Then, we establish the existence of incentive compatible price functions, which drive the network into an equilibrium point that coincides with the optimum of a social function. Specifically, these price functions are the derivatives of the social function. We then extend our results to the case in which users can identify only sub-optimal paths, as is often the case with multiobjective path optimization.},

To overcome the effects of propagation delays the scheduler measures the delays between the terminals and the hub and takes that delay into account when scheduling transmissions. Simple scheduling algorithms, based on a look-ahead capability, are used to overcome the effects of head-of-line blocking. An important application area for this system is in optical access networks, where this novel MAC protocol can be used to access wavelengths in a WDM passive optical network (PON).},

title={A heuristic for placement of limited range wavelength converters in all-optical networks},
year={1999},

pages={908-915 vol.2},
abstract={Wavelength routed optical networks have emerged as a technology that can effectively utilize the enormous bandwidth of the optical fiber. Wavelength converters play an important role in enhancing the fiber utilization and reducing the overall call blocking probability of the network. As the distortion of the optical signal increases with the increase in the range of wavelength conversion in optical wavelength converters, limited range wavelength conversion assumes importance. Placement of wavelength converters is a NP complete problem in an arbitrary mesh network. In this paper, we investigate heuristics for placing limited range wavelength converters in arbitrary mesh wavelength routed optical networks. The objective is to achieve near optimal placement of limited range wavelength converters resulting in reduced blocking probabilities and low distortion of the optical signal. The proposed heuristic is to place limited range wavelength converters at the most congested nodes, nodes which lie on the long lightpaths and nodes where conversion of the optical signals is significantly high. We observe that limited range converters at a few nodes can provide almost the entire improvement in the blocking probability as the full range wavelength converters placed at all the nodes. Congestion control in the network is brought about by dynamically adjusting the weights of the channels in the link thereby balancing the load and reducing the average delay of the traffic in the entire network. Simulations have been carried out on a 12-node ring network, 14-node NSFNET, 19-node European Optical Network (EON), 30-node INET network and the results agree with the analysis.},

The cross-connect switches can be implemented as wavelength routers resulting in WDM networks, or as ATM virtual path (VP) switches leading to ATM compatible network systems. We show in the paper that this network architecture results in a significant increase in throughput performance in comparison with SONET ring networks. For a certain class of meshed rings, under a uniform traffic matrix, we derive the optimal topology which achieves maximum throughput efficiency. For practical implementation reasons, we investigate the performance of networks which employ a reduced number of identifiers (e.g., using fewer wavelengths or fewer VPIs). We demonstrate that by increasing the bandwidth allocated to wavelength subnetworks, the required number of wavelengths is reduced. Furthermore, we show that by modifying the topological layout of the meshed ring network, we can reduce substantially the number of required wavelengths (or identifiers), while incurring just a modest reduction in throughput efficiency.},

abstract={We present a novel static power control scheme to improve system capacity in wireless cellular networks. Our basic idea is to reduce intercellular interference and improve the capture probability by coordinating transmission powers of users in different cells. This coordination is determined beforehand and no real-time coordination is required. Power control is static and fixed. We formulate and solve a generic optimal scheduling problem with our coordination scheme. We find that the optimal scheduling policy is in a simple form of bang-bang control, which is illustrated for a specific case with the uniform fairness constraint. We evaluate, via numerical analysis and simulation, both throughput and delay, and compare them with other schemes. We find that the coordination scheme can achieve significant performance improvement, in terms of both maximum throughput and throughput-delay tradeoff, over a wide range of capture ratio values.},

abstract={Due to the fast-growing demand for network capacity in wireless networks, the characterization of network capacity has become one of the most fundamental and pressing issues. While there have been considerable efforts to study CDMA systems at both the physical layer and network layer, the network capacity of power-controlled CDMA systems with linear receivers, especially in fading environments, is not well-understood. In this paper, we study a single-cell synchronous CDMA system equipped with the matched filter receiver in fading channels, and identify the network capacity for single-class systems and the network capacity region for multiple-class systems assuming known distributions of received powers of mobile users. Both the network capacity and network capacity region can be uniquely expressed in terms of the users QoS requirements and the distributions of the received powers. We also find the tightest upper bound of the network capacity over all possible distributions of received powers, and explore the concepts of effective target SIR and effective bandwidth, which play an important role in determining the admissibility and characterizing the network capacity.},

year={1999},

pages={948-956 vol.2},
abstract={A Kalman-filter method for power control is proposed for broadband, packet-switched TDMA wireless networks. By observing the temporal correlation of cochannel interference when transmitters can send data contiguously, a Kalman filter is used to predict interference power in the future. Based on the predicted interference and estimated path gain between the transmitter and receiver, the transmission power is determined to achieve a desired signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Performance results reveal that the Kalman-filter method for power control provides a significant performance improvement. Specifically, when a message consists of 10 packets on average, the 90 and 95 percentile of the SINR by the new method are 3.94 and 5.53 dB above those when no power control is in use, and lie just 0.73 and 1.04 dB below the upper-bound performance of the optimal power control, respectively, in a system with 4-sector cells and an interleaved frequency assignment of a reuse factor of 2/8. As a by-product, these results show that the cell layout and assignment scheme combined with the new method for power control can be used to support high-speed data services.},

title={New dynamic SPT algorithm based on a ball-and-string model},
year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={973-981 vol.2},
abstract={A key functionality in today's widely used interior gateway routing protocols such as OSPF and IS-IS involves the computation of a shortest path tree (SPT). In many existing commercial routers, the computation of an SPT is done from scratch following changes in the link states of the network. As there may coexist multiple SPTs in a network with a set of given link states, such recomputation of an entire SPT not only is inefficient but also causes frequent unnecessary changes in the topology of an existing SPT and creates routing instability. This paper presents a new dynamic SPT algorithm that makes use of the structure of the previously computed SPT. This algorithm is derived by recasting the SPT problem into an optimization problem in a dual linear programming framework, which can also be interpreted using a ball-and-string model. In this model, the increase (or decrease) of an edge weight in the tree corresponds to the lengthening (or shortening) of a string. By stretching the strings until each node is attached to a tight string, the resulting topology of the model defines an (or multiple) SPT(s). By emulating the dynamics of the ball-and-string model, we can derive an efficient algorithm that propagates changes in distances to all affected nodes in a natural order and in a most economical way. Compared with existing results, our algorithm has the best-known performance in terms of computational complexity as well as minimum changes made to the topology of an SPT. Rigorous proofs for correctness of our algorithm and simulation results illustrating its complexity are also presented.},

title={Performance trade-offs in reliable group multicast protocols},
year={1999},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={982-989 vol.2},
abstract={This paper presents an extensive performance study in order to identify some tradeoffs between tree-based and ring-based reliable group multicast protocols. The motivation for such a study is the following observation. In communications network routing from one node to another over a tree embedded in the network is intuitively a good strategy, since it typically results in a route length of O(log n) links, while routing from one node to another over a ring embedded in the network would result in route length of O(n) links. However, in a group multicast (many-to-many) the overall number of links traversed by each packet for both tree and ring embedding is typically O(N), so both approaches have similar communication requirements. In reliable group multicast protocols the traffic pattern is complex, since packets are sent from a multicast source to the multiple destinations, and then some control packets are sent back to the source, and this can result in resending of some of the original packets. Consequently, determining under what condition the tree-based approach is better than ring-based approach is not obvious. The key criteria for evaluating the performance of a reliable group multicast protocol is (i) how many successful multicast were achieved per unit time, and (ii) what is the efficiency of the multicast, namely, the ratio between the number of successful transmission and the total number of packets that were transmitted. Under the above criteria it is shown that the ring-based multicast often performs better than the tree-based multicast. One of the main reasons for this result is that ring-based multicast is window-based with simple and effective management of acknowledgments and retransmissions, while the tree-base is rate-based with complex and slow management of acknowledgments and retransmissions.},

pages={990-1000 vol.2},
abstract={We study congestion control for one-to-many multicast applications in the Internet and establish a three-way relationship between the choice of regulation parameter (i.e., rate or window size), the requirement to estimate receiver round trip times, and the type of fairness that may be accomplished. In particular, we show that in order to provide TCP-compatible fairness in rate-based regulation, receiver round trip times must be known. However, such a requirement does not exist in window-based regulation. We further show that measurement of receiver round-trip times in multicast communication, is fundamentally different and more complex than unicast communication, in order to avoid implosion of acknowledgments at the source. A major part of the paper deals with extending window-based regulation to multicast communications. We show that window-based regulation using a common window-size for the whole session leads to unnecessary restrictions on the throughput. To alleviate this problem, we propose a multicast window scheme using a distinct window size for each receiver, and enforcing it as the limit on the number of outstanding packets to that receiver. The complexity of window-based regulation can be defused by a receiver-driven implementation and by consolidation of receiver feedback in successive stages, e.g., using a hierarchical architecture. This hierarchical approach is also useful for scalable consolidation of receiver feedback in the case of rate-based regulation, and for distributed estimation of receiver round trip times, when such estimation is necessary.},

year={1999},
volume={1},

pages={3-11 vol.1},
abstract={The mobile IP (MIP) protocol for IP version 4 provides continuous Internet connectivity to mobile hosts. However, currently it has some drawbacks in the areas of survivability, performance, interoperability with protocols for providing QoS. We have proposed an alternative protocol, mobile IP with location registers (MIP-LR), which overcomes some of these drawbacks and is closer to the "service node" database approach used in the public switched telephone network (PSTN): before launching a packet to the mobile host, the sender first queries a database, called the home location register (HLR), to obtain the recipient's current location. MIP-LR is designed for operation in enterprise environments or within logical administrative domains. We focus on showing how MIP-LR enhances the survivability of MIP by eliminating some of the functions which MIP introduces for mobility support, allowing the HLR to be placed outside the mobile's home network in case the latter is particularly vulnerable, and replicating and distributing HLRs. We present two schemes for managing the multiple HLRs and enabling mobile and correspondent hosts to dynamically discover the addresses of the HLRs serving a given mobile host. The first scheme introduces a set of translation server (TS) databases while the second uses a form of quorum consensus based on the triangle lattice (TL); for the latter we present an enhanced protocol called the optimistic TL(OTL). For both schemes we present algorithms for mobile host registration and packet delivery, protocols for recovery from HLR failures, and complexity analysis of the overhead involved.},

abstract={Internet telephony realizes the transmission of two-way and real-time traffic over IP-based networks. The dominant standard for Internet telephony is ITU-T Rec. H.323. With the current version of H.323, Internet telephony allows interoperability with circuit-switched telephone, but IP host mobility is not supported. In this paper, mobile extensions to H.323 that enable mobile Internet telephony service are proposed. The proposed approach combines the characteristics of both cellular phone system and mobile IP mechanism with Internet telephony, and therefore realizes the transmission of real-time voice traffic for both stationary and mobile hosts over IP-based networks. The most striking feature of the proposed approach is that the complicated mobility management functions are handled by the procedures for dynamically joining and departing from a conference, functions already defined in H.323. Therefore, our approach allows mobility support without the need for additional new entities, and with minimal modifications to existing H.323 standard. Such mobility extensions can serve as an add-on feature for the existing Internet telephony systems compliant to the H.323 standard.},

We use this model to characterize the cell residence time and obtain analytical results for the channel holding time, the distribution of which is of primary importance in teletraffic analysis of PCS networks. These results can be used to facilitate the computation together with the use of the partial fractional expansion technique.

The problem of tracking mobile users has been addressed by several studies, many of which attempt to reduce the wireless cost of users tracking. The basic idea shared by most of these works is that users update their location based on a pre-defined criterion. Unfortunately, some of these strategies require the use of information, such as the distance traveled from the last known location, that is not generally available to the user. For this reason, both the implementation of some of these strategies and the performance comparison to existing strategies is not clear. We propose to use cell identification codes (CIC) for tracking mobile users. Each cell periodically broadcasts a short message which identifies the cell and its orientation relatively to other cells in the network. This information is used by the users to efficiently update their location. We propose several cell identification encoding schemes, which are used to implement different tracking strategies. The best performance is achieved by a four-bit CIC, used to implement a distance-based tracking strategy in a two dimensional system. In addition, we propose a combination of timer and movement tracking strategy, based on either a one-bit or a two-bit CIC, depending on system topology and user mobility. An important property of our framework is that the overall performance cost, and hence its comparison to existing methods, is evaluated for each tracking strategy. The CIC-based strategies are shown to outperform the timer-based method over a wide range of parameters.},

abstract={We develop a network calculus for processes whose burstiness is stochastically bounded by general decreasing functions. This calculus enables one to prove the stability of feedforward networks and obtain statistical upper bounds on interesting performance measures such as delay, at each buffer in the network. The bounding methodology is useful for a large class of input processes, including important processes exhibiting "subexponentially bounded burstiness" such as fractional Brownian motion. Moreover, it generalizes previous approaches and provides much better bounds for common models of real-time traffic, like Markov modulated processes and other multiple time-scale processes. We expect that this new calculus will be of particular interest in the implementation of services providing statistical guarantees.},

pages={43-50 vol.1},
abstract={We address the parameterization problem for traffic envelopes needed for deterministic traffic regulation and service guarantees. A parameterized function is a good "substitute" for a traffic envelope if (i) the substitute is not smaller than the envelope and (ii) no other functions not smaller than the envelope are smaller than the substitute. Analogous to the least square approximation problem in a vector space, we use projections under the (min, +)-algebra to find a substitute for a traffic envelope. To facilitate the computation of operations under the (min, +)algebra, we develop the concept of ordered orthogonal buses. A substitute for a traffic envelope can be represented by a coordinate vector with respect to an ordered orthogonal basis. Operations under the (min, +)-algebra, including pointwise minimum, convolution, subadditive closure, and pointwise maximum, can then be computed on the domain of coordinate vectors. A substitute and its coordinate vector forms a transform pair, called C-transform in the paper. The C-transform is related to the Legendre (or convex) transform and has many properties such as Parseval's formula.},

year={1999},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={51-62 vol.1},
abstract={This paper investigated the problem of deriving token bucket parameters from the observed traffic patterns of computer network flows in two cases. In the basic case, we identified the set of token bucket parameters for any given flow so that all the packets in the flow will be delivered immediately without incurring any delay or loss. Then, we extended the basic case by adding a queue to the token bucket model to temporarily store packets that cannot be delivered right away until enough tokens get accumulated in the bucket. The queue has the effect of smoothing the traffic so that the resulting token bucket parameters are less demanding. It also makes the derived token bucket parameters less fluctuated over time. Relationship among the queue size and token bucket parameters for a given flow are analyzed rigorously. Queuing delay for each packet in the flow is calculated and used to describe the adjusted post-queuing traffic pattern. Simple and efficient algorithms for the derivation of measurement-based traffic specification (MBTS) are presented, along with empirical results. This MBTS technology alleviates the need for users to explicitly characterize the traffic a priori in order to reserve network resource in an integrated services network.},

title={A time varying filtering theory for constrained traffic regulation and dynamic service guarantees},
year={1999},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={63-70 vol.1},
abstract={By extending the filtering theory under the (min, +)-algebra to the time varying setting, we solve the problem of constrained traffic regulation and develop a calculus for dynamic service guarantees. For a constrained traffic regulation problem with maximum tolerable delay d and maximum buffer size q, the optimal regulator that generates the output traffic conforming to a subadditive envelope f and minimizes the number of discarded packets is a concatenation of the g-clipper with g(t)=min[f(t+d), f(t)+q] and the maximal f-regulator. The g-clipper is a bufferless device which optimally drops packets as necessary in order that its output be conformant to an envelope g. The maximal f-regulator is a buffered device that delays packets as necessary in order that its output be conformant to an envelope f. The f-regulator is a linear time invariant filter with impulse response f, under the (min, +)-algebra. To provide dynamic service guarantees in a network, we develop the concept of a dynamic server as a basic network element. Dynamic servers can be joined by concatenation, "filter bank summation" and feedback to form a composite dynamic server, we also show that dynamic service guarantees for multiple input streams sharing a work conserving link can be achieved by a dynamic SCED (service curve earliest deadline) scheduling algorithm, if an appropriate admission control is enforced.},

abstract={As networks grow in scale and heterogeneity, hierarchical organization is inevitable. We present the case for optimal self-organization of network hierarchies. We provide a graph partitioning formulation relevant to networking but different from extant graph partitioning literature. In particular, we require that the resultant partitions be connected, a constraint that changes the character of the problem significantly. We devise a solution that consists of distinct phases for initial partitioning, refinement and post-processing, propose efficient heuristics for each phase, and evaluate them extensively on internetwork-like graphs through simulation. The results suggest that vertex trading techniques, in vogue for a number of decades in graph partitioning, are highly applicable, but multilevel techniques favored by conventional graph partitioning research may be of limited value for internetwork-like graphs. This solution can be implemented in practical networks to automatically generate Internet OSPF areas or ATM PNNI clusters.},

volume={1},

pages={79-87 vol.1},
abstract={This paper is focused on the problem of hop-by-hop routing in a network where different nodes have different views of the network topology. In particular, each node may be aware of just a subset of the network links, perceiving the rest as if their cost was infinite. We formalize the idea of node's individual view of the network with the concept of visibility sets and introduce a routing approach based on the notion of a feasible path, i.e., such path in the node's visibility set that satisfies certain specified restrictions. It is shown that, in a network with general visibility sets, forwarding the packet along an optimal feasible path is necessary and sufficient to guarantee its eventual delivery to destination without being dropped or routed to the same node twice. Based on the proposed approach, we derive the precise routing policy and formulate an efficient algorithm to search for a family of one-to-all optimal feasible paths in a network with embedded visibility sets. We then proceed to prove the correctness of the algorithm. The new routing method provides for execution of multiple dynamic routing protocols, possibly overlaying each other in the same address space, within a network with common kinds of metrics of arbitrary complexity. It solves the problem of interoperability when new metrics or novel link properties are being introduced and eliminates the necessity to run different protocols and protocol versions within disjoint routing domains.},

pages={98-106 vol.1},
abstract={As communications networks grow in both speed and scale, there is a need to switch packets at higher speeds. One approach is to use fast switches that operate at the datalink layer (layer 2) to build a high-performance "cloud" for interconnecting network layer routers. The use of ATM for the layer 2 network provides a number of advantages when the network is shared among multiple services and when additional capabilities that are supported well at layer 2, such as fine-grained per-flow QoS, are needed. This paper describes a robust and efficient solution to the problem of supporting IP over a large non-broadcast multiple-access (NBMA) network, such as ATM. The solution, known as SUBMARINE, calculates loop-free shortcut routes across the NBMA network. SUBMARINE builds on existing IP routing protocols, is designed to scale to multiple areas within a single autonomous system, and makes minimal changes to the IP forwarding process.},

abstract={Much work on the performance of Web proxy caching has focused on high-level metrics such as hit rates, but has ignored low level details such as "cookies", aborted connections, and persistent connections between clients and proxies as well as between proxies and servers. These details have a strong impact on performance, particularly in heterogeneous bandwidth environments where network speeds between clients and proxies are significantly different than speeds between proxies and servers. We evaluate through detailed simulations the latency and bandwidth effects of Web proxy caching in such environments. We drive our simulations with packet traces from two scenarios: clients connected through slow dialup modems to a commercial ISP, and clients on a fast LAN in an industrial research lab. We present three main results. First, caching persistent connections at the proxy can improve latency much more than simply caching Web data. Second, aborted connections can waste more bandwidth than that saved by caching data. Third, cookies can dramatically reduce hit rates by making many documents effectively uncacheable.},

pages={117-125 vol.1},
abstract={We propose and study a new technique, which we call cache-based compaction for reducing the latency of Web browsing over a slow link. The compaction technique trades computation for bandwidth. The key observation is that an object can be coded in a highly compact form for transfer if similar objects that have been transferred earlier can be used as references. The contributions of this paper are: (1) an efficient selection algorithm for selecting similar objects as references, and (2) an encoding/decoding algorithm that reduces the size of a Web object by exploiting its similarities with the reference objects. We verify the efficacy of our proposal through detailed experimental evaluations. This compaction technique significantly generalizes previous work on optimizing Web transfer using compression or differencing, and provides a systematic foundation that ties together caching, compression and prefetching.},

title={Web caching and Zipf-like distributions: evidence and implications},
year={1999},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={126-134 vol.1},
abstract={This paper addresses two unresolved issues about Web caching. The first issue is whether Web requests from a fixed user community are distributed according to Zipf's (1929) law. The second issue relates to a number of studies on the characteristics of Web proxy traces, which have shown that the hit-ratios and temporal locality of the traces exhibit certain asymptotic properties that are uniform across the different sets of the traces. In particular, the question is whether these properties are inherent to Web accesses or whether they are simply an artifact of the traces. An answer to these unresolved issues will facilitate both Web cache resource planning and cache hierarchy design. We show that the answers to the two questions are related. We first investigate the page request distribution seen by Web proxy caches using traces from a variety of sources. We find that the distribution does not follow Zipf's law precisely, but instead follows a Zipf-like distribution with the exponent varying from trace to trace. Furthermore, we find that there is only (i) a weak correlation between the access frequency of a Web page and its size and (ii) a weak correlation between access frequency and its rate of change. We then consider a simple model where the Web accesses are independent and the reference probability of the documents follows a Zipf-like distribution. We find that the model yields asymptotic behaviour that are consistent with the experimental observations, suggesting that the various observed properties of hit-ratios and temporal locality are indeed inherent to Web accesses observed by proxies. Finally, we revisit Web cache replacement algorithms and show that the algorithm that is suggested by this simple model performs best on real trace data. The results indicate that while page requests do indeed reveal short-term correlations and other structures, a simple model for an independent request stream following a Zipf-like distribution is sufficient to capture certain asymptotic properties observed at Web proxies.},

The accelerator resides in front of one or more Web servers. Our accelerator can serve up to 5000 pages/second from its cache on a 200 MHz PowerPC 604. This throughput is an order of magnitude higher than that which would be achieved by a high-performance Web server running on similar hardware under a conventional operating system such as Unix or NT. The superior performance of our system results in part from its highly optimized communications stack. In order to maximize hit rates and maintain updated caches, our accelerator provides an API which allows application programs to explicitly add, delete, and update cached data. The API allows our accelerator to cache dynamic as well as static data, analyze the SPECweb96 benchmark, and show that the accelerator can provide high hit ratios and excellent performance for workloads similar to this benchmark.},

abstract={We propose a novel buffer management scheme in order to regulate the individual queue lengths in a shared-memory switch. The primary motivations of our scheme are: (i) provide differentiated allocations to the queues sharing the memory, where the allocations are directly derived from the call admission control (CAC) parameters; (ii) allow for the co-existence of regulated and best-effort traffic achieving high buffer utilization without violating the guaranteed buffer allocations of the regulated connections; (iii) protect well-behaving connections that conform to their allocations from any misbehaviour in other traffic; and (iv) handle deviations in incoming traffic patterns, from the ones assumed by CAC, by distributing unavoidable losses in an equitable manner. The new scheme, which we call dynamic partitioning, achieves all these objectives, and constitutes a first example of a scheme that is highly efficient, derives its parameters directly from CAC, and is also very robust against misbehaviour. The scheme is simple to implement, and therefore amenable for deployment in current high-speed switches. We present the scheme in the context of ATM switches, together with cell level simulations for its validation.},

abstract={The traffic performance of ATM Adaptation Layer 2 (AAL2) cell assembly and disassembly (CLAD) is evaluated by an analytical method where AAL2 is standardized to convey low-bit-rate traffic such as mobile traffic including IMT-2000. The analytical formulas are applicable to dimensioning of the bandwidth of the output link of the CLAD. In particular, this paper evaluates the number of channels that can be multiplexed in the fixed capacity output link of AAL2 CLAD for various timeouts and buffer sizes. The arrival process is modeled as a discrete Markovian arrival process considering the talkspurt and silence period of a voice source, and discrete-time tandem queues modeling a cell assembly queue and a transmission queue are analyzed. An approximation model and its accuracy are also investigated and shown to be good for accuracy and computation time. The short packet loss ratio, which is lower than the cell loss ratio, is derived. Through numerical examples, this paper shows the statistical multiplexing gain of AAL2 and the various parameter ranges that yield higher efficiency than STM. It also shows that timeout has a complicated impact on the performance of AAL2, as a result of changes in the characteristics of cell arrival at the transmission queue.},

It implements true link-layer multicast, and offers a natural match to support network-layer QoS protocols such as RSVP. Because real-time performance guarantees fundamentally require state to be installed inside the network, link/switch failures could lead to significant disruption to the QoS promised to the user applications. This paper describes the fault detection and recovery mechanism supported by the EtheReal architecture, and reports on the performance measurements of the initial prototype implementation. The heart of EtheReal's fault detection and recovery mechanism is a fast spanning tree reconfiguration algorithm to reduce the total fault recovery time, and a delayed link inactivation scheme that allows real-time connections which are not affected by the failed links/switches to continue to exist, even though some of the links are marked as "blocked" in the new spanning tree topology. Measurements on the prototype show that the fault detection and recovery time on a network whose diameter is 10 hops are 220 ms and 31 ms, respectively. This combined delay corresponds to a minor jitter in real-time audio/video communication, and is a significant improvement over the standard IEEE 802.1d implementation, which takes on the order of 30 sec.},

title={Approximation capability of independent wavelet models to heterogeneous network traffic},

pages={170-177 vol.1},
abstract={In our previous work, we showed empirically that independent wavelet models were parsimonious, computationally efficient, and accurate in modeling heterogeneous network traffic measured by both auto-covariance functions and buffer loss rate. In this work, we focus on auto-covariance functions, to establish a theory of independent wavelet models as unified models for heterogeneous network traffic. We have developed the theory on the approximation capability of independent wavelet models for heterogeneous traffic in terms of the decay rate of auto-covariance functions at large lags. Average auto-covariance functions of independent wavelet models have been derived and shown to be linear combinations of basis functions. Through a simple analytical expression, we have shown that the decay rate of the auto-covariance functions of independent wavelet models is determined explicitly through a single quantity called the rate function of variances of wavelet coefficients. By specifying analytical forms of the rate function, independent wavelet models have been shown as unified models of heterogeneous traffic in terms of auto-covariance functions. The simplicity of the theory thereby provides both quantitative and qualitative explanations why independent wavelet models are unified models of heterogeneous traffic.},

pages={178-186 vol.1},
abstract={We present, prove correctness for, and evaluate a protocol for the reliable broadcast of topology and link-state information in a multihop communication network with a dynamic topology, such as a wireless network with mobile nodes. The protocol is called topology broadcast based on reverse path forwarding (TBRPF), and uses the concept of reverse-path forwarding (RPF) to broadcast link-state updates in the reverse direction along the spanning tree formed by the minimum-hop paths from all nodes to the source of the update TBRPF uses the topology information received along the broadcast trees to compute the minimum-hop paths that form the trees themselves, and is the first topology broadcast protocol based on RPF with this property. The use of minimum-hop trees instead of shortest-path trees (based on link costs) results in less frequent changes to the broadcast trees and therefore less communication cost to maintain the trees. Simulations show that TBRPF achieves up to a 98% reduction in communication cost compared to flooding in a 20-node network.},

pages={187-193 vol.1},
abstract={Many transmission scheduling algorithms have been proposed to maximize the spatial reuse and minimize the time division multiple access (TDMA) frame length in multihop packet radio networks. Almost all existing algorithms assume exact network topology information and require recomputations when the network topology changes. In addition, existing work focuses on single channel TDMA systems. In this paper, we propose a multichannel topology-transparent algorithm based on latin squares. This algorithm has the flexibility to allow the growth of the network, i.e., the network can add more mobile nodes without recomputation of transmission schedules for existing nodes. At the same time, a minimum throughput is guaranteed. We analyze the efficiency of our algorithm, and examine the topology-transparent characteristics and the sensitivity on design parameters by simulation.},

year={1999},
volume={1},

pages={194-201 vol.1},
abstract={A new multichannel MAC protocol called hop-reservation multiple access (HRMA) for wireless ad-hoc networks (multi-hop packet radio networks) is introduced, specified and analyzed. HRMA is based on simple half-duplex, very slow frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) radios and takes advantage of the time synchronization necessary for frequency-hopping. HRMA allows a pair of communicating nodes to reserve a frequency hop using a reservation and handshake mechanism that guarantee collision-free data transmission in the presence of hidden terminals. We analyze the throughput achieved in HRMA for the case of a hypercube network topology assuming variable-length packets, and compare it against the multichannel slotted ALOHA protocol, which represents the current practice of MAC protocols in commercial ad-hoc networks based on spread spectrum radios, such as Metricom's Ricochet system. The numerical results show that HRMA can achieve much higher throughput than multichannel slotted ALOHA within the traffic-load ranges of interest, especially when the average packet length is large compared to the duration of a dwell time in the frequency hopping sequence, in which case the maximum throughput of HRMA is close to the maximum possible value.},

abstract={CEDAR is an algorithm for QoS routing in ad hoc network environments. It has three key components: (a) the establishment and maintenance of a self-organizing routing infrastructure called the core for performing route computations, (b) the propagation of the link-state of stable high-bandwidth links in the core through increase/decrease waves, and (c) a QoS route computation algorithm that is executed at the core nodes using only locally available state. But preliminary performance evaluation shows that CEDAR is a robust and adaptive QoS routing algorithm that reacts effectively to the dynamics of the network while still approximating link-state performance for stable networks.},

abstract={There is an increasing need for Internet hosts to be able to quickly and efficiently learn the distance, in terms of metrics such as latency or bandwidth, between Internet hosts. For example, to select the nearest of multiple equal content Web servers. This paper explores technical issues related to the creation of a public infrastructure service to provide such information. In so doing, we suggest an architecture, called IDMaps, whereby Internet distance information is distributed over the Internet, using IP multicast groups, in the form of a virtual distance map. Systems listening to the groups can estimate the distance between any pair of IP addresses by running a spanning tree algorithm over the received distance map. We also presents the results of experiments that give preliminary evidence supporting the architecture. This work thus lays the initial foundation for future work in this new area.},

pages={218-226 vol.1},
abstract={This paper examines the network routing messages exchanged between core Internet backbone routers. Internet routing instability, or the rapid fluctuation of network reachability information, is an important problem currently facing the Internet engineering community. High levels of network instability can lead to packet loss, increased network latency and time to convergence. At the extreme, high levels of routing instability have led to the loss of internal connectivity in wide-area, national networks. In an earlier study of inter-domain routing, we described widespread, significant pathological behaviour in the routing information exchanged between backbone service providers at the major US public Internet exchange points. These pathologies included several orders of magnitude more routing updates in the Internet core than anticipated, large numbers of duplicate routing messages, and unexpected frequency components between routing instability events. The work described in this paper extends our earlier analysis by identifying the origins of several of these observed pathological Internet routing behaviour. We show that as a result of specific router vendor software changes suggested by our earlier analysis, the volume of Internet routing updates has decreased by an order of magnitude. We also describe additional router software changes that can decrease the volume of routing updates exchanged in the Internet core by an additional 30 percent or more. We conclude with a discussion of trends in the evolution of Internet architecture and policy that may lead to a rise in Internet routing instability.},

pages={227-234 vol.1},
abstract={Packet delay and loss traces are frequently used by network engineers, as well as network applications, to analyze network performance. The clocks on the end-systems used to measure the delays, however, are not always synchronized, and this lack of synchronization reduces the accuracy of these measurements. Therefore, estimating and removing relative skews and offsets from delay measurements between sender and receiver clocks are critical to the accurate assessment and analysis of network performance. We introduce a linear programming-based algorithm to estimate the clock skew in network delay measurements and compare it with three other algorithms. We show that our algorithm has a time complexity of O(N), leaves the delay after the skew removal positive, and is robust in the sense that the error margin of the skew estimate is independent of the magnitude of the skew. We use traces of real Internet delay measurements to assess the algorithm, and compare its performance to that of three other algorithms. Furthermore, we show through simulation that our algorithm is unbiased, and that the sample variance of the skew estimate is better (smaller) than existing algorithms.},

The authors solutions to these problems include the use of a packet window to adapt quickly to bandwidth changes, receiver only packet pair to combine accuracy and ease of deployment, and potential bandwidth filtering to increase the accuracy. These techniques are at least as accurate as previously used filtering algorithms, and in some situations, they are more than 37% more accurate.},

abstract={We investigate the problem of optimal resource allocation for end to-end QoS requirements on unicast paths and multicast trees. Specifically, we consider a framework in which resource allocation is based on local QoS requirements at each network link, and associated with each link is a cost function that increases with the severity of the QoS requirement. Accordingly, the problem that we address is how to partition an end-to-end QoS requirement into local requirements, such that the overall cost is minimized. We establish efficient (polynomial) solutions for both unicast and multicast connections. These results provide the required foundations for the corresponding QoS routing schemes, which identify either paths or trees that lead to minimal overall cost. In addition, we show that our framework provides better tools for coping with other fundamental multicast problems, such as dynamic tree maintenance.},

abstract={Using multicast delivery to multiple receivers reduces the aggregate bandwidth required from the network compared to using unicast delivery to each receiver. To encourage the use of multicast delivery, a higher amount of bandwidth should be allocated to a multicast row as compared to a unicast row that share the same bottleneck, but without starving the unicast flow. We investigate three bandwidth allocation policies for multicast flows and evaluate their impact on the bandwidth received by the individual receivers. The policy that allocates the available bandwidth as a logarithmic function of the number of receivers downstream of the bottleneck achieves the best trade-off between maximizing the receiver satisfaction and keeping fairness high.},

abstract={We study the problem of scheduling files over a broadcast channel in an asymmetric environment. The goal is to minimize the mean response time for clients who access the broadcast channel. Asymmetric channels gained a lot of attention since they are used to model wireless communication, Teletext systems, and Web caching in satellite systems. This paper addresses the 2-files case. We design a simple algorithm that defines the optimal schedule given the demand probability for each file. The solution is extended to include two other important factors: dependencies between files and variable-length files. Adding dependencies is important in particular in the Web caching environment since clients may wish to access more than one file in the broadcast channel. For these extensions, we prove the surprising result that there exists a simple optimal schedule. Such a schedule is composed of a repeated pattern of AA...AB where A is the more "popular" file and B is the less "popular" file.},

abstract={Mirror sites enable client requests to be serviced by any of a number of servers, reducing load at individual servers and dispersing network load. Typically, a client requests service from a single mirror site. We consider enabling a client to access a file from multiple mirror sites in parallel to speed up the download. To eliminate complex client-server negotiations that a straightforward implementation of this approach would require, we develop a feedback-free protocol based on erasure codes. We demonstrate that a protocol using fast Tornado codes can deliver dramatic speedups at the expense of transmitting a moderate number of additional packets into the network. This scalable solution extends naturally to allow multiple clients to access data from multiple mirror sites simultaneously. The approach applies naturally to wireless networks and satellite networks as well.},

abstract={Internet traffic has grown significantly with the popularity of the Web. Consequently user perceived latency in retrieving Web pages has increased. Caching and prefetching at the client side, aided by hints from the server, are attempts at solving this problem. We suggest techniques to group resources that are likely to be accessed together into volumes, which are used to generate hints tailored to individual applications, such as prefetching, cache replacement, and cache validation. We discuss theoretical aspects of optimal volume construction, and develop efficient heuristics. Tunable parameters allow our algorithms to predict as many accesses as possible while reducing false predictions and limiting the size of hints. We analyze a collection of large server logs, extracting access patterns to construct and evaluate volumes. We examine sampling techniques to process only portions of the server logs while constructing equally good volumes. We show that it is possible to predict requests at low cost with a high degree of precision.},

pages={294-303 vol.1},
abstract={This paper presents a new approach for consistently caching dynamic Web data in order to improve performance. Our algorithm, which we call data update propagation (DUP), maintains data dependence information between cached objects and the underlying data which affect their values in a graph. When the system becomes aware of a change to underlying data, graph traversal algorithms are applied to determine which cached objects are affected by the change. Cached objects which are found to be highly obsolete are then either invalidated or updated. The DUP was a critical component at the official Web site for the 1998 Olympic Winter Games. By using DUP, we were able to achieve cache hit rates close to 100% compared with 80% for an earlier version of our system which did not employ DUP. As a result of the high cache hit rates, the Olympic Games Web site was able to serve data quickly even during peak request periods.},

abstract={As a growing number of Web sites introduce mirrors to increase throughput, the challenge for clients is determining which mirror will offer the best performance when a document is to be retrieved. We present findings from measuring 9 clients scattered throughout the United States retrieving over 490,000 documents from 47 production Web servers which mirror three different Web sites. We have several interesting findings that may aid in the design of protocols for choosing among mirror servers. Though server performance varies widely, we have observed that a server's performance relative to other servers is more stable and is independent of time scale. In addition, a change in an individual server's transfer time is not a strong indicator that its performance relative to other servers has changed. Finally, we have found that clients wishing to achieve near-optimal performance may only need to consider a small number of servers rather than all mirrors of a particular site.},

abstract={We study the issues arising when considering the problem of reconfiguring broadcast optical networks in response to changes in the traffic patterns. Although the ability to dynamically optimize the network under changing traffic conditions has been recognized as one of the key features of multiwavelength optical networks, this is the first in-depth study of the tradeoffs involved in carrying out the reconfiguration process. We first identify the degree of load balancing and the number of retunings as two important, albeit conflicting, objectives in the design of reconfiguration policies. We then formulate the problem as a Markovian decision process and we develop a systematic and flexible framework in which to study reconfiguration policies. We apply results from Markov decision process theory to obtain optimal reconfiguration policies for networks of large size. The advantages of optimal policies over a class of threshold-bused policies are illustrated through numerical results.},

abstract={We study a class of circuit-switched wavelength routing networks with and without wavelength converters, and we present the first part of a new analytical framework to accurately and efficiently evaluate the blocking performance of such networks. The model allows non-uniform traffic, it accounts for the correlation among the loads at all links in a path, and it can be used when the location of converters is fixed but arbitrary. We first construct an exact Markov process that captures the behaviour of a path in terms of wavelength use. We also obtain an approximate Markov process which has a closed-form solution that can be efficiently computed for short paths. We then develop an iterative algorithm to analyze approximately arbitrarily long paths. The algorithm decomposes a path into shorter segments which are then studied in isolation using the corresponding approximate Markov process. The individual solutions are appropriately combined to obtain a solution for the original path. Finally, we demonstrate how the analytical techniques can be used to gain insight into the problem of converter placement in wavelength routing networks.},

title={Computing approximate blocking probabilities in wavelength routed all-optical networks with limited-range wavelength conversion},
year={1999},
volume={1},

pages={329-336 vol.1},
abstract={We propose a method to calculate the average blocking probability in all-optical networks using limited-range wavelength conversion. Previous works have shown that there is a remarkable improvement in blocking probability while using limited-range wavelength conversion but these analytical models were either for a path or for a mesh-torus network. Using a graph-theoretical approach, we extend Birman's model (see IEEE JSAC/JLT Special I on Optical Networks, vol.14, no.5, p.852-57, 1996) for no wavelength conversion and derive an analytical expression to compute the blocking probabilities in networks with limited-range wavelength conversion for fixed routing. The proposed analytical model is a generalization of Birman's model and is applicable to any network topology. We consider the case where an incoming wavelength can be converted to d adjacent outgoing wavelengths on either side of the input wavelength, in addition to the input wavelength itself, where d is the degree of conversion. Using this model we demonstrate that the performance improvement obtained by full wavelength conversion over no wavelength conversion can almost be achieved by using limited-wavelength conversion with the degree of conversion, d, being only 1 or 2. In a few example networks we considered, for blocking probabilities up to a few percent, the carried traffic with limited-conversion degree d=2 was almost equal to the carried traffic for full wavelength conversion. The results obtained show that significant improvements in blocking performance can be obtained by providing limited-range wavelength conversion of small degree within the network.},

abstract={The substantial growth expected in the near future in the demand of transmission bandwidth to be used in a dynamic and flexible transport network makes the development of all-optical digital crossconnect architectures very important. We consider here in particular the class of the rearrangeable non-blocking space-division switching fabrics configured as multistage structures built with very simple optical switching elements. Rearrangeable networks look today more attractive than strict-sense non-blocking networks since the former have a lower complexity and are compatible with the data loss rate required in a circuit-switched network even with current technology of optical switching devices. We face one the most important problems which arises in a multiple space-channel optical system such as a photonic switching fabric, that is the build-up of crosstalk noise on a certain channel due to the interference with other signals inside the system. We find here the design rules to configure a minimum-cost rearrangeable photonic switching network where the most serious cause of crosstalk (interference inside the switching elements) is eliminated.},

abstract={Understanding and modelling packet loss in the Internet is especially relevant for the design and analysis of delay-sensitive multimedia applications. We present analysis of 128 hours of end-to-end unicast and multicast packet loss measurement. From these we selected 76 hours of stationary traces for further analysis. We consider the dependence as seen in the autocorrelation function of the original loss data as well as the dependence between good run lengths and loss run lengths. The correlation timescale is found to be 1000 ms or less. We evaluate the accuracy of three models of increasing complexity: the Bernoulli model, the 2-state Markov chain model and the k-th order Markov chain model. Out of the 38 trace segments considered, the Bernoulli model was found to be accurate for 7 segments, and the 2-state model was found to be accurate for 10 segments. A Markov chain model of order 2 or greater was found to be necessary to accurately model the rest of the segments. For the case of adaptive applications which track loss, we address two issues of on-line loss estimation: the required memory size and whether to use exponential smoothing or a sliding window average to estimate average loss rate. We find that a large memory size is necessary and that the sliding window average provides a more accurate estimate for the same effective memory size.},

pages={353-360 vol.1},
abstract={The efficacy of end-to-end multicast transport protocols depends critically upon their ability to scale efficiently to a large number of receivers. Several research multicast protocols attempt to achieve this high scalability by identifying sets of co-located receivers in order to enhance loss recovery, congestion control and so forth. A number of these schemes could be enhanced and simplified by some level of explicit knowledge of the topology of the multicast distribution tree, the value of the bottleneck bandwidth along the path between the source and each individual receiver and the approximate location of the bottlenecks in the tree. In this paper, we explore the problem of inferring the internal structure of a multicast distribution tree using only observations made at the end hosts. By noting correlations of loss patterns across the receiver set and by measuring how the network perturbs the fine-grained timing structure of the packets sent from the source, we can determine both the underlying multicast tree structure as well as the bottleneck bandwidths. The simulations show that the algorithm is robust and appears to converge to the correct tree with high probability.},

abstract={We explore the use of end-to-end multicast traffic as measurement probes to infer network internal characteristics. We have developed in an earlier paper a maximum likelihood estimator for packet loss rates on individual links based on losses observed by multicast receivers. This technique exploits the inherent correlation between such observations to infer the performance of paths between branch points in the multicast tree spanning the probe source and its receivers. We evaluate through analysis and simulation the accuracy of our estimator under a variety of network conditions. In particular, we report on the error between inferred loss rates and actual loss rates as we vary the network topology, propagation delay, packet drop policy, background traffic mix, and probe traffic type. In all but one case, estimated losses and probe losses agree to within 2 percent on average. We feel this accuracy is enough to reliably identify congested links in a wide-area internetwork.},

title={Minimizing end-to-end delay in high-speed networks with a simple coordinated schedule},
year={1999},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={380-388 vol.1},
abstract={We study the problem of providing end-to-end delay guarantees in connection-oriented networks. In this environment, multiple-hop sessions coexist and interfere with one another. Parekh and Gallager (1993, 1994) showed that the weighted fair queueing (WFQ) scheduling discipline provides a worst-case delay guarantee comparable to 1/(/spl rho/i)/spl times/K/sub i/ for a session with rate /spl rho//sub i/ and K/sub i/ hops. Such delays can occur since a session-i packet can wait for time 1/(/spl rho/i) at every hop. We describe a work-conserving scheme that guarantees an additive delay bound of approximately 1/(/spl rho/i)+K/sub i/. This bound is smaller than the multiplicative bound 1/(/spl rho/i)/spl times/K/sub i/ of WFQ, especially when the hop count K/sub i/ is large. We call our scheme coordinated-earliest-deadline-first (CEDF) since it uses an earliest deadline-first approach in which simple coordination is applied to the deadlines for consecutive hops of a session. The key to the bound is that once a packet has passed through its first server, it can pass through all its subsequent servers quickly. We conduct simulations to compare the delays actually produced by the two scheduling disciplines. In many cases, these actual delays are comparable to their analytical worst-case bounds, implying that CEDF outperforms WFQ.},

title={Efficient fair queueing for ATM networks using uniform round robin},
year={1999},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={389-397 vol.1},
abstract={In this paper, we investigate scheduling algorithms that are suitable for ATM networks. In ATM networks, all packets have a fixed small length of 53 bytes and they are transmitted at very high rate. Therefore a time complexity of a scheduling algorithm is quite important. Most scheduling algorithms proposed so far have a complexity of O(log N) per packet, where N denotes the number of connections sharing the link. In contrast, weighted round robin(WRR) has the advantage of having O(1) complexity; however, it is known that its delay property gets worse as N increases, To solve this problem, in this paper we propose two new variants of WRR, uniform round robin (URR) and idling uniform round robin (I-URR). Both disciplines provide end-to-end delay and fairness bounds which are independent of N. Complexity of URR, however, slightly increases as N increases, while I-URR has complexity of O(1) per packet. I-URR also works as a traffic shaper, so that it can significantly alleviate congestion on the network. We also introduce a hierarchical WRR discipline (H-WRR) which consists of different WRR servers using I-URR as the root server. H-WRR efficiently accommodates both guaranteed and best-effort connections, while maintaining O(1) complexity per packet. If several connections are reserving the same bandwidth, their delay bounds achieved by H-WRR are close to those of weighted fair queueing.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a generalised minimum queuing delay (GMQD) service discipline for high speed networks, mainly asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. This proposed scheme is similar to service disciplines based on fair queuing, but instead of using only a single service rate for each session for its entire connection lifetime, multiple service rates are used. The service rate of any session at any point in time is computed efficiently based on the number of bits backlogged in the queues of the session and another imaginary reference session at that point in time. The main advantage of this scheme is that the queuing delays suffered by all the sessions connected to a single output node are minimised, leading to a smaller delay variation. In addition, this smaller delay variation also implies a smaller variance in the maximum queue length, thereby, reducing the possibility of buffer overflow.},

abstract={In this paper we focus on real-time scheduling of "soft" real-time data services such as multimedia data, MPEG video streaming and IP telephony, which can tolerate a small degree of loss or delay. We argue that network operators and service providers should be able to select from a range of quality of service objectives, including maximizing the number of customers receiving good service. Further, we argue that scheduling disciplines such as fair queueing are unable to achieve such goals and hence there is a need for alternative approaches. We propose a new scheduling scheme, which we call the dual queue discipline. We show that the dual queue has the flexibility to satisfy a variety of QoS objectives, ranging from existing notions of fairness through to maximizing the number of customers receiving good service. In addition, even the simplest dual queue implementation outperforms fair queueing, is scalable in the number of active sessions, and can be made fair, if desired, over moderate to long time scales.},
