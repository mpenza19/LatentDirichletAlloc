abstract={We study the maximum throughput properties of dynamically reconfigurable optical networks having wavelength and port constraints. Using stability as the throughput performance metric, we outline the single-hop and multi-hop stability regions of the network. We describe throughput-optimal dynamic algorithms employing joint WDM reconfiguration and electronic layer routing decisions. Our approach is a generalization of the BvN decomposition technique that has been so effective at expressing any stabilizable rate matrix for input-queued switches as a convex combination of service configurations. We consider generalized decompositions for physical topologies with wavelength and port constraints. For the case of a single wavelength per optical fiber, we link the decomposition problem to a corresponding Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem. We characterize the stability region of the reconfigurable network, employing both single-hop and multi- hop routing, in terms of the RWA problem applied to the same physical topology. We derive expressions for two geometric properties of the stability region: maximum stabilizable uniform arrival rate, and maximum scaled doubly substochastic region. These geometric properties provide a measure of the performance gap between a network having a single wavelength per optical fiber and its wavelength-unconstrained version. They also provide a measure of the performance gap between algorithms employing single-hop versus multi-hop electronic routing.},

year={2006},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-5},
abstract={We believe that a congestion control algorithm should make flows finish quickly - as quickly as possible, while staying stable and fair among flows. Recently, we proposed RCP (Rate Control Protocol) which enables typical Internet-sized flows to complete one to two orders of magnitude faster than the existing (TCP Reno) and the proposed (XCP) congestion control algorithm. Like XCP, RCP uses explicit feedback from routers, but doesn't require per-packet calculations. A router maintains just one rate that it gives to all flows, making it simple and inherently fair. Flows finish quickly because RCP aggressively gives excess bandwidth to flows, making it work well in the common case. However - and this is a design tradeoff - RCP will experience short-term transient overflows when network conditions change quickly (e.g. a route change or flash crowds). In this paper we extend RCP and propose RCP-AC (Rate Control Protocol with Acceleration Control) that allows the aggressiveness of RCP to be tuned, enabling fast completion of flows over a broad set of operating conditions.},

abstract={100 gigabit Ethernet (100 GbE) is widely envisioned as the next-generation Ethernet, driven by continued capacity growth in provider networks, new emerging high-bandwidth applications, and an evolutionary trend from TDM to packet transport, particularly in the metro space. We will describe some key application areas where 100 GbE will probably be employed first. We further discuss possible implementations on the physical layer (PHY) and argue for the need of an efficient framer and against a medium access controller (MAC). Particularly for MANs and WANs, the most prominent candidate for the required framing will be based on the optical transport network (OTN, ITU-T G.872/G.709). 100 GbE will be an IEEE 802.3 standard and will hence only define the access control of and the transport on the physical sublayer. However, the challenges for realizing 100 GbE are related to Ethernet <i>switching</i> and not to Ethernet <i>transport</i>.},

abstract={Instantaneous fair sharing (IFS) is a traditional network ideal prescribing to share the network capacity among competing applications fairly during any infinitesimal time interval. In this paper, we argue that IFS is an inappropriate ideal for the application of massive data transfers where the primary goal is to minimize message transfer times. We propose an alternative paradigm of virtual finish time first (ViFi) scheduling that dedicates the entire capacity to one message at a time in the order of message finish times under IFS. Unlike shortest remaining time first and other earlier algorithms for dedicated scheduling, ViFi provides a remarkable guarantee of delivering each message no later than under IFS. Our analysis and simulations show the dedicated ViFi scheduling offers significant reductions in the average transfer time. The above properties make ViFi a promising approach for resource allocation in emerging dedicated-channel networks that enable advance reservation of end-to-end channels between hosts.},

abstract={Recently, Ethernet technology has received a lot of attention for large area networks as well as local area networks (LANs) due to its economical advantage. However, the Ethernet technology has scalability issues when it is applied to large area networks. In this paper, we present hierarchical broadcast ring architecture that provides scalability to high-speed Ethernet networks. The proposed Ethernet switch-based network architecture adopts mechanisms of IP router-based networks. The logical ring topology of the architecture provides the broadcast service without a broadcast storm problem. A shortest path link-state routing is used for data forwarding for high link utilization. Furthermore, the hierarchical proxy ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) scheme and an aggregation scheme of IP addresses are proposed to reduce the number of broadcast frames and the forwarding table size. As a result, the hierarchical broadcast ring architecture can support millions of hosts with a high-speed Ethernet network. The proposed architecture maintains the simple and efficient management and operation of the Ethernet network for large area networks.},

abstract={As traffic on the Internet continues to grow exponentially, there is a real need to solve transmission and switching scalability. Moreover, future Internet traffic will be dominated by streaming media flows, such as video-telephony, video-conferencing, 3D video, virtual reality, and many more. Consequently, network solutions will need to offer quality of service and traffic engineering together with the above mentioned scalability - i.e., over-provisioning is not likely be a viable solution to accommodate streaming media traffic. This paper describes the architecture of a ultra-scalable IP switch and the first experiments with a prototypal implementation. The switch scalability is a consequence of it operating pipeline forwarding of packets, which also results in quality of service guarantees for UDP-based streaming applications, while preserving elastic TCP-based traffic as is, i.e., without affecting any existing applications based on "best- effort" services. Moreover, the prototype demonstrates the low complexity of pipeline forwarding implementation as the deployed network gear was realized from off-the-shelf components in only nine months through the design, implementation, and testing efforts of the authors.},

abstract={In this paper we try to answer a fundamental question: how to build the next generation network without disruption. The TCP/IP protocol stack has performance limits and the transparent bridge paradigm of Ethernets is complex to scale by lack of addressing hierarchy. To provide both full scalability and high performance, a new Ethernet switching architecture named universal Ethernet telecommunications service (UETS) is proposed, capable of performances in the range of terabits per second. It is based on hardware switching of Ethernet frames using topological and hierarchically assigned standard local MAC addresses, technique named Ethernet fabric routing (EFR). The architecture solves Ethernet's scalability and security problems, has low cost/performance ratio and is compatible with existing Ethernet and IP networks, providing a non disruptive migration path to high performance networks and overcoming TCP/IP performance limitations. The objective is to promote a new standard for UETS/EFR architecture, suitable for high performance specialized island networks that may operate together as an overlay network.},

abstract={In a high-speed environment (e.g. Gigabit Ethernet), a single network firewall is a potential bottleneck and increasingly susceptible to denial of service (DoS) attacks. Although creating a faster single firewall is possible, the performance benefits are only temporary as network speeds continue to increase. Therefore new firewall architectures are needed to meet the demands of high-speed networks. This paper reviews different parallel firewall architectures that have the ability to process packets at high speeds. Each design uses an array of firewalls to enforce a security policy, but will differ on how the array is used. Data-parallel distributes arriving packets across the array allowing greater throughput, while function-parallel distributes the rules which reduces processing delay. In general, the parallel designs are more scalable and significantly faster than a traditional single firewall. Simulation will demonstrate the performance benefits of the parallel designs under realistic conditions.},

abstract={Lightpath scheduling is an important capability in next-generation wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks to reserve resources in advance for a specified time period while provisioning end-to-end lightpaths. In this study, we propose an approach to support dynamic lightpath scheduling in such networks. To minimize blocking probability in a network that accommodates dynamic scheduled lightpath demands (D- SLDs), resource allocation should be optimized in a dynamic manner. However, for the network users who desire deterministic services, resources must be reserved in advance and guaranteed for future use. These two objectives may be mutually incompatible. Therefore, we propose a two-phase dynamic lightpath scheduling approach to tackle this issue. The first phase is the deterministic lightpath scheduling phase. When a lightpath request arrives, the network control plane schedules a path with guaranteed resources so that the user can get a quick response with the deterministic lightpath schedule. The second phase is the lightpath re-optimization phase, in which the network control plane re-provisions some already scheduled lightpaths. Experimental results show that our proposed two-phase dynamic lightpath scheduling approach can greatly reduce WDM network blocking.},

abstract={This work focuses on the problem of dynamic provisioning of bidirectional connections in all-optical WDM networks. In absence of wavelength converters, each data path forming a bidirectional lightpath needs to use the same wavelength on every link of the entire route (i.e., wavelength continuity constraint). Though existing GMPLS framework faces up the bidirectional lightpath establishment, it fails with high probability under the WCC restriction. Therefore, a distributed and dynamic routing and wavelength assignment (DRWA) algorithm is proposed to perform bidirectional path computation taking into account global wavelength network utilization. By doing so, the algorithm is capable to meet efficiently with the WCC each particular connection request. The performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated and compared in the ADRENALINE testbed using a traditional bandwidth-based algorithm as a benchmark. The results are expressed in terms of connection blocking and setup delay for different traffic loads.},

We studied the optimal design of the future next-generation network GIGANET2, choosing a new topology, predicting future capacity demands and taking into account real pricing information obtained from telecom companies and optical hardware vendors. The study consisted of involved optimization efforts, and large-scale comparisons of optical hardware and available fiber infrastructure. This work resulted in the design of a physical optical ring topology, together with three network scenarios which are subject to different bandwidth, reliability and cost considerations, closely matching the institutions' requirements. This paper presents the final results of the study.},

abstract={Rapid progress in deployment of national and regional optical network infrastructures holds the promise to provide abundant, inexpensive bandwidth to scientific communities. The expectation is that this will provide a catalyst for innovation across a range of eScience applications. However, there remains considerable architecture and research work in order to allow such applications to access a common shared high-speed infrastructure efficiently and flexibly. This paper presents an experimental solution currently being designed and tested over the Dynamic resource allocation via GMPLS optical networks (DRAGON) and the Internet2 hybrid optical and packet infrastructure (HOPI). This implementation provides deterministic network services to high-end eScience applications in the form of Ethernet "circuits" using GMPLS to dynamically provision user specific VLAN based configurations. This requires addressing several research issues associated with multi-layer networks, interdomain routing, signaling, and multi-constraint path computation. The larger vision is that of a shared infrastructure consisting of multiple network technology layers over which an intelligent control plane can provide for a unified service model. The instantiation described here of Ethernet over WDM provides an ideal platform for both experimental research and, real services, and a migration path to a production infrastructure.},

abstract={More and more traffic management techniques, including accounting and load adaptive routing, try to take advantage of the fact that traffic demands are consistent with Zipf's law. By treating a few large volume demands differently they try to capture most of the traffic. This relies on the implicit assumption that traffic demands are persistent in volume over time; meaning that their volume does not change drastically over time. As this assumption has been shown to be incorrect we in this paper focus on how Internet flows behave over time. Accordingly, this paper examines the characteristics of volatility in a qualitative way by characterizing the components that are responsible for changes in the cast of heavy hitters over time.},

abstract={Peer-to-peer systems are becoming increasingly popular, with millions of simultaneous users and a wide range of applications. Understanding existing systems and devising new peer-to-peer techniques relies on access to representative models derived from empirical observations. Due to the large and dynamic nature of these systems, directly capturing global behavior is often impractical. Sampling is a natural approach for learning about these systems, and most previous studies rely on it to collect data. This paper addresses the common problem of selecting representative samples of peer properties such as peer degree, link bandwidth, or the number of files shared. A good sampling technique will select any of the peers present with equal probability. However, common sampling techniques introduce bias in two ways. First, the dynamic nature of peers can bias results towards short-lived peers, much as naively sampling flows in a router can lead to bias towards short-lived flows. Second, the heterogeneous overlay topology can lead to bias towards high-degree peers. We present preliminary evidence suggesting that applying a degree-correction method to random walk-based peer selection leads to unbiased sampling, at the expense of a loss of efficiency.},

abstract={In this paper we adopt a simulation approach to study the performance of the BitTorrent protocol in terms of the entropy that qualifies a torrent and the structure of the overlay used to distribute the content. We find that the entropy of a torrent, defined as the diversity that characterizes the distribution of pieces of the content, plays an important role for the system to achieve optimal performance. We then relate the performance of BitTorrent with the characteristics of the distribution overlay built by the peers taking part in the torrent. Our results show that the number of connections a given peer maintains with other peers and the fraction of those connections initiated by the peer itself are key factors to sustain a high entropy, hence an optimal system performance. Those results were obtained for a realistic choice of torrent sizes and system parameters, under the assumption of a flash-crowd peer arrival pattern.},

abstract={With the widespread availability of inexpensive broadband Internet connections for home-users, a large number of bandwidth-intensive applications previously not feasible have now become practical. This is the case for multimedia live streaming, for which end-user's dial-up/ISDN modem connections once were the bottleneck. The bottleneck is now mostly found on the server side: the bandwidth required for serving many clients at once is large and thus very costly to the broadcasting entity. Peer-to-peer systems for on-demand and live streaming have proved to be an encouraging solution, since they can shift the burden of content distribution from the server to the users of the network. In this work we introduce PULSE, a P2P system for live streaming whose main goals are flexibility, scalability, and robustness. We present the fundamental concepts that stand behind the design of PULSE along with its intended global behavior, and describe in detail the main algorithms running on its nodes.},

year={2006},

abstract={BitTorrent (BT) in the last years has been one of the most effective mechanisms for P2P content distribution. Although BT was created for distribution of time insensitive content, in this work we try to identify what are the minimal changes needed in the BT's mechanisms in order to support streaming. The importance of this capability is that the peer will now have the ability to start enjoying the video before the complete download of the video file. This ability is particularly important in highly polluted environments, since the peer can evaluate the quality of the video content early and thus preserve its valuable resources. In a nutshell, our approach gives higher download priority to pieces that are close to be reproduced by the player. This comes in contrast to the original BT protocol, where pieces are downloaded in an out-of-order manner based solely on their rareness. In particular, our approach tries to strike the balance between downloading pieces in: (a) playing order, enabling smooth playback, and (b) the rarest first order, enabling the use of parallel downloading of pieces. In this work, we introduce three different Piece Selection mechanisms and we evaluate them through simulations based on how well they deliver streaming services to the peers.},

abstract={Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing applications have witnessed a dramatic increase in popularity during the past few years. To accommodate the rapid growth in user population, developers introduced new features in their client software, in particular a two-tier overlay topology. The effect of the two- tier overlay topology in a widely-deployed P2P system primarily depends on the availability and coherency of its implementations among participating clients throughout the system. This paper sheds some light on the long-term evolution of such a two-tier overlay topology in the Gnutella network during a 15-month period over which the system quadrupled in size, exceeding three million concurrent peers. Our results show two interesting phenomena including: (i) During this period, the two- tier overlay has repeatedly begun to lose its balance. However, proper modifications in major client software coupled with the rapid upgrade rate of users, has enabled the developers to maintain the overlay's desired properties, (ii) Despite its random connectivity, the Gnutella overlay exhibits a strong bias towards intra-continent connectivity, especially in continents with smaller user populations, that has not changed as the system scaled.},

abstract={The nature of digital content is undergoing a radical transformation due to the growing infusion of user-generated content. Users that generate content have a strong motivation to actively promote their content in order to achieve publicity, recognition or to simply spread their viewpoints, knowledge and creations. Existing content sharing mechanisms available to such users, such as in P2P file sharing, are pull-based, relegating the user to a passive role. To enable active participation from users, we propose Promoter, a framework that enhances P2P file sharing systems to support content promotion in addition to the available pull-based content search. Promotion is enabled by publicizing a user's content to peers and disseminating the content by incentivizing peers to download and further propagate it.},

abstract={We present a distributed algorithm for the clustering of peers in a Networked Virtual Environment (NVE) that are organized using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network based on the Delaunay triangulation. The algorithm is dynamic in the sense that whenever a peer joins or leaves the NVE, the clustering will be adapted if necessary by either splitting a cluster or merging clusters. The main idea of the algorithm is to classify links between adjacent peers into short intra-cluster and long inter-cluster links. The advantages of clustering are multiple: clustering allows to limit queries to the peers of a cluster avoiding to flood the entire network. Since clusters can be seen as a level of abstraction that reduces the amount of information/detail exposed about the NVE, clustering allows for faster navigation in the NVE and reduces the number of messages a node receives when he travels through the NVE.},

abstract={Large-scale peer-to-peer systems span a wide range of Internet locations. Such diversity can be leveraged to build overlay "detours" to circumvent periods of poor performance on the default path. However, identifying which peers are "good" relay choices in support of such detours is challenging, if one is to avoid incurring an overhead that grows with the size of the peer- to-peer system. This paper proposes and investigates the Earliest Branching Rule (EBR) to perform such a selection. EBR builds on the Earliest Diverging Rule (EDR) that selects relay nodes whose AS path diverges from the default path at the earliest possible point, but calls for monitoring a much smaller number of paths. As a result, it has a much lower overhead. The paper explores the performance and overhead of EBR, and compares them to that of EDR. The results demonstrate that EBR succeeds in selecting good relay nodes with minimum control overhead. Hence, providing a practical solution for dynamically building good overlays in large peer-to-peer systems.},

However, a key problem of such systems are peers overusing a resource. This paper presents a fully decentralized scheme to achieve fair use in P2P systems, which does not require a priori information about a peer. The approach developed is based on a scarce resource trading scheme (SRTCPU), which utilizes CPU time as a form of payment. SRTCPU provides an incentive to offer CPU time in return of consuming a scarce resource. A distributed DNS has been implemented as an example application that uses SRTCPU.},

The coming years will add a significant level of dynamic behavior, such as mobile nodes and moving networks, which the Internet must support. At the same time, there is a need to address the increasing levels of harmful traffic and denial-of-service attacks. The existing Internet architecture does not support dynamic behavior or secure communication to a sufficient degree. This paper outlines a node-identity-based internetworking architecture that allows heterogeneous networks to work together without loss of functionality. Some of techniques employed in this architecture include reliance on cryptographic node identifiers, identity routers and localized addressing realms.},

abstract={The pre-shared key based mechanisms for Transport Layer Security (TLS) were recently standardized by the IETF to extend the set of ciphersuites by utilizing existing key management infrastructures. The benefit of pre-shared based mechanisms is the avoidance or reduction of the cryptographic operations used in public-key based mechanisms. However, so far there are no performance measurements for pre-shared key based ciphersuites available. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis and performance comparison between the pre-shared key exchange mechanisms and the standard public key exchange mechanisms in TLS. Our performance metrics are processing time and transmitted amount of data for a handshake establishment. Furthermore, the interaction between the overall TLS handshake duration and the network environment is evaluated. The results for different key exchange mechanisms are comparatively studied and the design choices of pre-shared key based key exchange mechanisms have been validated. Experimental results give details about the performance improvement of the pre-shared key based mechanisms compared to the standard public key based mechanisms.},

year={2006},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-6},
abstract={Routing algorithms such as Distance Vector and Link States have the routing table size as Omega (n), where n is the number of destination identifiers, thus providing only limited scalability for large networks when n is high. As the distributed hash table (DHT) techniques are extraordinarily scalable with n, our work aims at adapting a DHT approach to the design of a network- layer routing algorithm so that the average routing table size can be significantly reduced to O (log n) without losing much routing efficiency. Nonetheless, this scheme requires a major breakthrough to address some fundamental challenges. Specifically, unlike a DHT, a network-layer routing algorithm must (1) exchange its control messages without an underlying network, (2) handle link insertion/deletion and link-cost updates, and (3) provide routing efficiency. Thus, we are motivated to propose a new network-layer routing algorithm, Tunnel Vector (TV), using DHT-like multilevel routing without an underlying network. TV exchanges its control messages only via physical links and is self-configurable in response to linkage updates. In TV, the routing path of a packet is near optimal while the routing table size is O(log n) per node, with high probability. Thus, TV is suitable for routing in a very large network.},

abstract={Striping is a resource aggregation technique that can improve application performance for a multihomed host by utilizing multiple interfaces. In this position paper, we argue in favor of decoupling striping primitives from all of the traditional layers of the networking protocol stack, and instead resurrecting the session layer for striping. Session layer striping indeed allows applications to take advantage of multihoming, while avoiding most of the deployability issues traditionally linked with modiflying application layer code. We illustrate our argument with a strawman architecture for a session layer striping protocol, and sketch how such a protocol could be implemented.},

abstract={This paper presents operational experience of large-scale unicast network tomography, that samples a part of the European Internet. In the paper we describe in detail the ETOMIC measurement platform that was used to conduct the experiments, and its potential in future scaled-up measurements. The main results of the paper are maps showing various spatial and temporal structure in the characteristics of queueing delay corresponding to the resolved part of the European Internet. These maps reveal that the average queueing delay on different network segments spans more than two orders of magnitude. At the most loaded time of day we find that the distribution of average queueing delays among the different segments follows closely a log-normal distribution.},

volume={},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Explicit congestion notification (ECN) and active queue management (AQM) Schemes such as random early detection (RED), adaptive random early detection (ARED) and BLUE queues have been proposed for TCP/IP networks to compensate network congestion. However, using ECN requires that ECN be supported by both TCP senders and receivers. This paper presents a novel AQM modification called receiver- window modification (RWM). RWM can be used together with RED, ARED and BLUE queues, to provide congestion avoidance in packet switched networks at ingress and gateway routers. RWM does not require modification to all end system TCP/IP stacks but can be solely implemented in routers. Our RWM scheme helps in reducing the average queue sizes of RED, ARED, BLUE and even ARED-ECN, BLUE-ECN and RED- ECN queues. By reducing the average queue sizes, RWM queues reduce the queuing delay resulting in significant improvements in one-way end-to-end packet delays and dropped packets. It is also shown that the performance of RED- ECN, ARED-ECN and BLUE-ECN queues is heavily dependent on the queues of the downstream routers. RWM modified queues in ingress or gateway routers are not influenced by the number and state of the downstream router as they will piggyback congestion information to the source in the next available acknowledgement packet. We carry out extensive ns2 simulations to show our results and to support our claims.},

title={Bandwidth Sharing with Primary Paths for Protection Routing in an MPLS Network},
year={2006},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-6},
abstract={In label-switched networks such as MPLS, protection routing involves computing and setting up the backup paths at the same time when the primary paths are routed. It has previously been shown that two or more backup paths may share bandwidth along common links if such backup paths will never be activated simultaneously. Such sharing between the backup paths leads to reduced bandwidth reservations and, hence improved performance in terms of number of path requests that can be accommodated on the network (Aslam et al., 2005). We present a novel idea that backup paths may also share bandwidth with certain primary paths, thereby further reducing the overall bandwidth reservations on the network. This results in even more path requests being accommodated on the network. Sharing with primary paths is possible with any protection routing framework. To demonstrate this sharing, we use the NPP protection routing framework as an example (Aslam et al., 2005). We provide the enhancements to the NPP framework needed to exploit sharing with the primary paths. For the enhanced NPP framework, simulation results on various networks confirm that sharing with primary paths indeed results in better network utilization. This increased performance is achieved with bounded local state information and without requiring any additional routing or signaling overhead.},

year={2006},
volume={},

pages={1-5},
abstract={The distribution of broadcast TV across large provider networks has become a highly topical subject as satellite distribution capacity exhausts and competitive pressures increase. In a typical IPTV architecture, broadcast TV is distributed from two sources (for redundancy) to multiple destinations. The aim of this paper is to examine how IPTV can be reliably and cost effectively supported in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks. WDM networks have evolved to mesh topologies and recently to support multicast, which is particularly valuable in reducing the network cost in broadcast TV applications. Our goal is to find two trees with a minimal total cost such that we have two physically (or Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)) diverse paths to each of the destinations - one from each of the sources. Any two links that belong to a common SRLG are subject to a single point of failure, be it a channel or wavelength failure, a fiber cut, or a complete conduit cut. We first show that our path protection routing problem is NP-complete. We then propose an Integer Programming (IP) formulation for this problem. Using real network topology data, we show that the real networks are amenable to the IP problem formulation and yield optimal solutions.},

abstract={The end-to-end delay among a set of peers can be easily and scalably estimated using a landmark approach Peers' coordinates are deduced from delay measurements to a small number N of landmarks L{L1,..., Ln}. We wonder whether it is feasible to use such distributed solution for bandwidth estimation. This requires that each peer determines its bandwidth vector by measuring the direct and reverse bandwidth on its path with each landmark. The bandwidth vectors of two peers are then used to estimate the bandwidth between them in both ways. For a couple of peers, we denote by (i) direct path the network path that joins them directly using IP routing, and by (ii) indirect path the path that joins them via a landmark node. N indirect paths (N being the number of landmarks) are assigned to each direct path. Our idea is to estimate the bandwidth of the direct path using those of the indirect paths. The indirect paths that have more links common with the direct path, are assigned more weight in the estimation function. We consider different estimation functions and we study the impact of the landmarks' locations on the accuracy of the estimations.},

abstract={We present in this work a new mechanism based on an innovative hybrid approach for traffic and collision control in wireless ad hoc networks. We combine the well known equation based technique with the measurement based one in a way to obtain a predictive state of the network. Combining these two entries can also have correction effects on foretold values. These properties can be obtained by using the Kalman filter on the sender side. The sender carries out a loss probability prediction process, then performs a RED like algorithm before sending each packet. It may also adapt its sending rate depending on the network loss probability. We react to collisions since we show that losses due to collisions occur before congestion, therefore reacting to these losses can prevent reaching the congestion level. We have already developed a loss probability equation function of the input rate in the network. We also introduce a new loss probability measurement technique based on periodic feedbacks. Even though our formula may not calculate the exact loss probability value, due to some modeling simplifications, combining it to measurements will reduce and even remove these effects giving also a better prediction of future values.},

abstract={Emerging applications such as distance education and corporate training are examples of delay tolerant multimedia applications, where clients request the start of play back at a convenient time specified by (t+d<sub>i</sub>) where t is the current time and d<sub>i</sub> is the delay tolerance acceptable to client i. Such applications typically involve a Closed User Group (CUG) network that exhibits heterogeneous characteristics, where a Content Service Provider (CSP) disseminates multimedia content to geographically dispersed clients. Our research deals with the issue of maximizing rates (quality) at the clients while satisfying their delay tolerance with minimal additional resources. As a first step to this end, we have developed an optimization-based approach to determine the best quality that can be delivered to the clients through judicious placement of resources such as buffers and transcoders. Simulation results demonstrate the usefulness of exploiting client delay tolerance specifications for delivering enhanced Quality of Service (QoS) with little or no additional resources. By maximizing QoS to the clients with given resources, CSPs can (1) maximize the utilization of links (2) provide differentiated services to their clients, and (3) offer upgraded services to some clients (which may have a revenue implication). Our ongoing work deals with scheduling and admission control issues which would maximize profits for the CSP while satisfying the admitted clients' requirements with optimal resource utilization.},

Our work can broadly be viewed in two parts. In the first part, we concentrate on ad hoc wireless networks [3] and [4]. In particular, we consider broadcast in these networks where each node is owned by independent and selfish users. Being selfish, these nodes do not forward the broadcast packets. All existing protocols for broadcast assume that nodes forward the transit packets. So, there is need for developing new broadcast protocols to overcome node selfishness. In our paper [5], we develop a strategy proof pricing mechanism which we call immediate predecessor node pricing mechanism (IPNPM) and an efficient new broadcast protocol based on IPNPM. We show the efficacy of our proposed broadcast protocol using simulation results.},

Simulation results show that the packet delivery ratio in BGP-GCR+ is slightly lower than that in the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) for the high-mobility, small-scale (50-150 nodes), but higher for the medium-scale (200 nodes) MANETs. Moreover, the routing overhead is lower in BGP-GCR+ compared with AODV.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a hybrid feature selection method in which Principal Components Analysis is combined with optimized k- Means clustering technique. Our approach hierarchically reduces the redundancy of features with high explanation in PCA for choosing a good subset of features critical to improve the performance of classifiers. Based on this result, we evaluate the performance of intrusion detection by using a nonparametric density estimation approach based on Parzen-Window and k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers over data sets with reduced features. The experiment with KDD Cup 1999 data set show several advantages in terms of computational complexity and our method achieves significant detection rate which shows possibility of detecting successfully attacks.},

abstract={This paper gives us several perspectives of research. Indeed, we can think of configuring a set of multicast trees for a given domain. The number of multicast forwarding states needed to be stored is rather small as shown during the simulations. This set of trees can be rather stable and the routers do not need to configure others forwarding states for new multicast groups except in case of failures where a reconfiguration may be done. This allows to think of a distributed protocol where the entities responsible of the aggregation will not need to exchange messages in order to aggregate new groups.},

title={A Locating-First Approach for Scalable Overlay Multicast},
year={2006},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-2},
abstract={Recent proposals in multicast overlay networks have demonstrated the importance of exploiting underlying network topology data to construct efficient overlays. While they avoid virtual coordinates embedding and fixed landmarks measurements, these topology-aware proposals often rely on incremental and periodic refinements to improve each node's position in the delivery tree. We claim that there are barriers for the scalability of existing overlay multicast protocols. In fact, periodical refinement and control processes induce additional overhead and high communication cost. On the other hand, users attending a video conferencing session or an event broadcast expect an acceptable quality as soon as they join the multicast session. It is then important to overcome an efficiency problem from which almost all current overlay multicast proposals suffer. This problem is the long convergence time to reach a stabilized quality state in the overlay delivery tree. We propose a novel overlay multicast tree construction scheme, called LCC : Locate, Cluster and Conquer, designed to address the aforementioned scalability and efficiency issues. The scheme consists in two phases: a selective locating phase and an overlay construction phase. Using partial knowledge of location-information for participating nodes, the selective locating phase algorithm consists in locating the closest existing set of nodes (cluster) in the overlay for a newcomer. It allows then to avoid initially randomly-connected structures without using virtual coordinates system embedding nor fixed landmarks measurements. Then, on the basis of this locating process, the overlay construction phase consists in building and managing a topology-aware clustered hierarchical overlay.},

The main goal of this paper is to investigate the policy-based management (PBM) approach applied to GMPLS network functionality, covering both packet switching and circuit switching technologies. We propose PBM mechanisms and policies to facilitate and improve the collaboration between the management plane and the GMPLS control plane, for the purpose of efficient GMPLS TE and service provisioning. We point out guidelines for policy information modeling, and we propose to extend the PCIM/e with policy event, to explicitly model the triggering of policy rules. This will increase automation and operational efficiency. We also recommend that the relationships between policy and management information and related support information must be explicitly captured and represented in a coherent modeling approach. The topic of GMPLS TE and service provisioning should be put on the IETF agenda.},

abstract={Emerging network applications tend to be built over heterogeneous network resources spanning multiple management domains. Many such applications have dynamic demands for dedicated, deterministic, high-bandwidth connections. The generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) networks under development can address these kinds of demands by using policy-based resource management and service provisioning technologies. In this paper, we present the architecture and implementation for policy-based resource management and service provisioning as part of the work on the NSF funded dynamic resource allocation via GMPLS optical networks (DRAGON) Project. This work captures several critical features of service-oriented GMPLS networks, including a) collaborative interdomain resource management; b) interdomain end-to-end path computation; c) advance scheduled provisioning; and d) authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA). These features rely on the capability of exchanging and coordinating resource and policy information among multiple participating domains. In pursuit of this capability, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) resource computation model (RCM). The three broad dimensions of this model are traffic engineering (TE) constraints, time schedule constraints, and AAA policy constraints. The 3D RCM facilitates policy based resource allocation based on many specific constraints within these three broad categories. Based on this model we describe our approach to GMPLS interdomain end-to-end path computation, advance scheduled provisioning, and AAA policy based provisioning, respectively. Our current DRAGON implementation status is also reported in this paper.},

A control plane is under standardization by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) under the name generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS). However, this control plane is unaware of the specifications of the services to be enforced. This work presents a policy-based management architecture adapted to an emerging kind of optical networks called hybrid photonic networks. Contributing to network flexibility, we present extensions to the management plane of these transparent wavelength and switching capable networks that provide the means to leverage their inherent capabilities.

abstract={Policy-based management (PBM) is a promising approach to realize adaptivity in networks that would be hard - if not impossible - for administrators to configure manually. In PBM systems, the network configuration is not directly expressed in terms of low-level properties, such as IP or MAC addresses; rather, complex business entities, such as users or departments, can be defined and allow the administrators to specify high-level network policies. Even though PBM can reduce the effort for managing complex networks significantly, today's solutions lack a generic way for expressing adaptive policies. A PBM system can be called adaptive if the decision of when and in which order policies are activated is not only based on fixed predefined dates but the system also takes environmental and internal events into account. In this paper we describe a model of adaptive timing constraints and introduce an architecture for executing timing specifications (sets of constraints). Within a timing specification, the administrator usually creates single constraints only implicitly by defining the lifetime of managed resources, sequences of events, and high- level temporal relationships between them. Because each timing constraint defines a &lt; relation between two single events, a timing specification can be described as a partial ordering of events over the event space. During execution, a timing service triggers PBM systems to activate, inactivate, or adapt management policies according to the timing specification.},

title={TCP as an Implementation of Age-Based Scheduling: Fairness and Performance},
year={2006},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-12},
abstract={We show that different flavors of TCP may be viewed as implementations of age-based scheduling disciplines. By parameterizing the scheduling disciplines of interest we are able to position variants of TCP in a wide spectrum having FCFS (first-come first-served) and LAS (least attained service first) as extremal policies, and including PS (processor sharing) as an intermediate case. We argue that for highly loaded systems, providing a fair bandwidth allocation among all users is secondary to ensuring network stability. So as to isolate protocol fairness from congestion effects, we therefore focus on scenarios with infinite buffers. This way, asymmetries in capacity shares are the consequences of the protocol only, and not affected by the packet loss process. The model, however, is flexible enough to include finite buffers with random packet loss as a special case (for example to capture Active Queue Management). The results are helpful in studying fairness and performance concerned with transmission protocols in communication networks. For persistent HTTP connections we study the distributions of the transmission rates and the relative fairness index under various assumptions on the file size distributions and scheduling disciplines. For infinite file sizes, we show that protocols that increase priority more than linearly with the attained service asymptotically behave similar to FCFS. In contrast, protocols with at most linearly increasing (or even decreasing) priority, with TCP's Congestion Avoidance mechanism as the most prominent example, converge to PS scheduling (even in absence of losses). When the priority is exactly linear in the attained service, such as for scalable TCP and TCP's slow start phase, the shares remain constant in between file initiations and completions.},

abstract={In autonomous mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) where each user is its own authority, fully cooperative behaviors, such as unconditionally forwarding packets for each other, cannot be directly assumed. The pricing mechanism is one way to provide incentives for the users to act cooperatively by rewarding some payment for cooperative behaviors. Here, we model the pricing and routing in autonomous MANETs as multi-stage dynamic games. A dynamic pricing framework is proposed to maximize the sender/receiver's payoff by considering the dynamic nature of MANETs. Meanwhile, the forwarding incentives of the relay nodes can also be maintained by providing the optimal payments based on the auction rules. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed dynamic pricing schemes have significant performance gains over the existing static pricing algorithms.},

abstract={In the standard approach to studying connectivity, a physical layer is assumed that allows direct transmission between neighbors within some fixed distance. The graph resulting from connecting all such pairs of neighbors reveals clusters of nodes within which communication is possible. However, future wireless networks will provide a physical layer where nodes that are connected can collaboratively search for more connections via simultaneous RF transmission and reception, thus adding connections that are not possible in the traditional non-collaborative model. The purpose of this paper is to introduce this collaborative network model and to characterize its asymptotic connectivity properties for one characterization (noncoherent power summing) of the physical layer collaboration. In the case of sparse ad hoc networks, simulations show that an infinite cluster will emerge in the infinite two-dimensional plane at a node density roughly 20% of that required in non-collaborative ad hoc networks. In the case of dense ad hoc networks, the probability for the event that the network is connected goes to one asymptotically if the transmission area of each node is [4pi(4 log N)<sup>alpha/alpha+2</sup>(log log N+log 2)<sup>2/alpha+2</sup>]/N no less than , where N is the number of nodes in the network of unit area and a is the pathless exponent. Hence, significant gains in the asymptotic connectivity properties of the ad hoc network are obtained through collaboration.},

year={2006},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-13},
abstract={The performance of distributed networks depends on collaboration among distributed entities. To enhance security in distributed networks, such as ad hoc networks, it is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of participating entities since trust is the major driving force for collaboration. In this paper, we present a framework to quantitatively measure trust, model trust propagation, and defend trust evaluation systems against malicious attacks. In particular, we address the fundamental understanding of trust, quantitative trust metrics, mathematical properties of trust, dynamic properties of trust, and trust models. The attacks against trust evaluation are identified and defense techniques are developed. The proposed trust evaluation system is employed in ad hoc networks for securing ad hoc routing and assisting malicious node detection. The implementation is fully distributed. Simulations show that the proposed system can significantly improve network throughput as well as effectively detect malicious behaviors in ad hoc networks. Further, extensive simulations are performed to illustrate various attacks and the effectiveness of the proposed defense techniques.},

abstract={To study the resequencing delay caused by multipath routing, we consider a system of parallel queues under random routing as a model of network routing behavior. The impact of resequencing on packet end-to-end delay is explored through the newly introduced resequencing index. We compute this new metric under several distributional asumptions (e.g., light vs. heavy tails) on routing delays.},

title={Reverse Hashing for High-Speed Network Monitoring: Algorithms, Evaluation, and Applications},
year={2006},
volume={},

pages={1-12},
abstract={A key function for network traffic monitoring and analysis is the ability to perform aggregate queries over multiple data streams. Change detection is an important primitive which can be extended to construct many aggregate queries. The recently proposed sketches (Krishnamurthy, 2003) are among the very few that can detect heavy changes online for high speed links, and thus support various aggregate queries in both temporal and spatial domains. However, it does not preserve the keys (e.g., source IP address) of flows, making it difficult to reconstruct the desired set of anomalous keys. In an earlier abstract we proposed a framework for a reversible sketch data structure that offers hope for efficient extraction of keys (Schweller, 2004). However, this scheme is only able to detect a single heavy change key and places restrictions on the statistical properties of the key space. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient reverse hashing scheme to infer the keys of culprit flows from reversible sketches. There are two phases. The first operates online, recording the packet stream in a compact representation with negligible extra memory and few extra memory accesses. Our prototype single FPGA board implementation can achieve a throughput of over 16 Gbps for 40-byte-packet streams (the worst case). The second phase identifies heavy changes and their keys from the representation in nearly real time. We evaluate our scheme using traces from large edge routers with OC-12 or higher links. Both the analytical and experimental results show that we are able to achieve online traffic monitoring and accurate change/intrusion detection over massive data streams on high speed links, all in a manner that scales to large key space size. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first to achieve these properties simultaneously.},

title={Impact of the Inaccuracy of Distance Prediction Algorithms on Internet Applications - an Analytical and Comparative Study},
year={2006},
volume={},

pages={1-12},
abstract={Distance prediction algorithms use O(N) round trip time (RTT) measurements to predict the N<sup>2</sup> RTTs among N nodes. Distance prediction can be applied to improve the performance of a wide variety of Internet applications: for instance, to guide the selection of a download server from multiple replicas, or to guide the construction of overlay networks or multicast trees. Although the accuracy of existing prediction algorithms has been extensively compared using the relative prediction error metric, their impact on applications has not been systematically studied. In this paper, we consider distance prediction algorithms from an application's perspective to answer the following questions: (1) Are existing prediction algorithms adequate for the applications? (2) Is there a significant performance difference between the different prediction algorithms, and which is the best from the application perspective? (3) How does the prediction error propagate to affect the user perceived application performance? (4) How can we address the fundamental limitation (i.e., inaccuracy) of distance prediction algorithms? We systematically experiment with three types of representative applications (overlay multicast, server selection, and overlay construction), three distance prediction algorithms (GNP, IDES, and the triangulated heuristic), and three real-world distance datasets (King, PlanetLab, and AMP). We find that, although using prediction can improve the performance of these applications, the achieved performance can be dramatically worse than the optimal case where the real distances are known. We formulate statistical models to explain this performance gap. In addition, we explore various techniques to improve the prediction accuracy and the performance of prediction-based applications. We find that selectively conducting a small number of measurements based on prediction-based screening is most effective.},

abstract={The Virtual Mobility Control Domain (VMCD) is proposed to enhance mobility protocols such as Mobile IP and Network Mobility (NEMO). These mobility protocols rely on a single agent called the home agent. This leads to protocol weakness in terms of system robustness and redundant routes. In VMCD, multiple anchor points serving the same home network are placed as home agents at different networks on the Internet backbone. These anchor points advertise the route of the same home network to the backbone from different networks. It is similar to anycast routing approach of root DNS. By genuine routing, packets meant for mobile nodes are always drawn into the closest anchor point and are delivered to the mobile node by the anchor point on behalf of home agent. In addition, even if one of the anchor points fails, another anchor point immediately takes over for the failed anchor point. VMCD provides better routes for mobile nodes and protocol robustness with minimal involvement of end nodes. This paper discusses the VMCD solutions and shows the efficiency and effectiveness of VMCD.},

title={Capturing accurate snapshots of the Gnutella network},
year={2006},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-6},
abstract={A common approach for measurement-based characterization of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems is to capture overlay snapshots using a crawler. The accuracy of captured snapshots by P2P crawlers directly depends on both the crawling speed and the fraction of unreachable peers. This in turn affects the accuracy of the conducted characterization based on these captured snapshots. Prior studies frequently rely on crawling the network over an hour or more, during which time the overlay may change substantially. Moreover, none of the previous measurement-based studies on P2P systems have examined the accuracy of their captured snapshots or the impact on conducted characterization. In this paper, we present a fast P2P crawler called Cruiser, discuss aspects of its design, and evaluate its accuracy. Cruiser is able to crawl the million-node Gnutella network in around 7 minutes. Having these accurate snapshots enables us to quantify (i) the "relative error" in captured snapshot as a function of crawling speed, (ii) the tradeoff between the completeness and accuracy of captured snapshots, and (iii) the effect of snapshot accuracy on the correctness of characterizations of Gnutella.},
