title={A reliable token-passing bus LAN with reservation},
year={1989},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-8 vol.1},
abstract={Addition of a second bus is proposed to provide high bandwidth as well as reliable service for token-passing-bus LANs. The second bus proposed is normally used for reservation so that the token on the data bus is dynamically passed to ready users for packet transmission. Furthermore, it takes the place of the data bus when the data bus fails. A reservation token-passing protocol is used which not only is collision-free but also minimizes the token-passing delay. An analysis of this dynamic token-passing protocol includes both analytical and simulation results.<<ETX>>},

title={Performance analysis of token ring networks with reservation priority discipline},
year={1989},
volume={},
number={},
pages={9-18 vol.1},
abstract={A token ring network is considered, with priority-mode operation by a reservation discipline which is adopted by an IEEE standard 802.5. In the reservation discipline, a high-priority station can reserve the next transmission right in the reservation field of the message transmitted by the low-priority station when the reservation field passes through the high-priority station. Then the free token at the high-priority level is passed to the high-priority station. After all messages from the high-priority stations are transmitted, the free token is returned to the station in the downstream of the previous low-priority station. To apply this reservation discipline to an interconnected token ring network system, an analytical model is constructed which consists of low-priority stations with single buffer and a single high-priority station with infinite buffer, which is intended to represent a bridge. An exact analysis for the low-priority stations and an approximate analysis for the high-priority station in the reservation discipline is presented. System performance measures (mean waiting times and throughput) derived from the present analysis are compared with a mixed discipline which is an alternative method for priority-mode operation in token ring networks.<<ETX>>},

year={1989},
volume={},
number={},
pages={19-27 vol.1},
abstract={Z-NET, a high-speed local area network scheme using a dual unidirectional bus architecture and an optical-fiber transmission medium, is introduced. At very light loads, the protocol behavior is similar to a random-access scheme with zero packet delay. As load increases, the operation is similar to an implicit token-passing scheme and ensures fair round-robin scheduling among stations. The protocol is completely distributed, with no station performing any special function. When collisions occur, one station always continues its transmission to completion. Thus, the wastage of bandwidth caused by collisions is minimized. This is achieved using active and passive switches on the buses. Delay performance of Z-NET is superior to Expressnet. Fasnet and tokenless protocols at very light loads. At heavy load, performance is similar to that of Expressnet, with bounded packet delay. No special mechanisms are used to start new rounds or for transition between random and controlled access modes of transmission. Thus, the proposed scheme has the added advantage of simplicity.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The interconnection of CSMA/CD LANs using an N-port bridge is considered. The stability and throughput-delay performance of the interconnected system is analyzed approximately by decomposing it into N consistent but otherwise independent LAN subsystems. The performance of a LAN subsystem with bridge priority is evaluated, and the results are used for the performance evaluation of the interconnected system. Simulation results indicate that the decomposition approach provides reasonably accurate performance prediction. The bridge interconnection system is compared to a system in which the bridge is replaced by a repeater, and the performance advantages of the former system over the latter are quantified.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Analysis and performance comparisons are presented for synchronous discrete-time queuing systems operating under a message waiting-time or delay-time constraint. Four different system admission and preemption policies are investigated. Under either a wait-time constraint or a delay-time limit, either newly arriving messages are always admitted (and then properly dismissed if their required residence limits are not met) or a determination is made upon arrival on whether the new message can be served to completion within its required time limit, and only then is this message admitted. The delay-throughput performance of these admission and service-preemption policies is investigated and compared for synchronous discrete-time communications and processing systems modeled as a single-server Geom/G/1 discrete-time queuing system. Such models are used to describe various multiplexing and demand-assigned (reservation-based) multiple-access communication network systems operating under message delay limits.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Closed queuing network models representing computer systems with programs that have variation in concurrency level are discussed. For such models computation by existing approximation methods results in an explosion in the size of the state transition matrix. An innovative approximate analytic method based on the overall average concurrent level of programs is proposed.

This average concurrency method is a fast algorithm for predicting performance levels of computer systems. Various examples were studied and the accuracy of the method was confirmed determined by comparison to the results of more exact simulations.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A flow control mechanism based on an economic model of optimum decentralized decision making is presented. The virtual circuits (VCs) of the network are considered as economic agents competing for link capacity resources. Each VC is equipped with a preference relation defining its individual throughput-delay goals. The work makes three contributions to the study of flow control protocols. First, it presents fully decentralized flow control algorithms that allocate capacity to reflect both, varying priorities among VCs as well as their preferences and needs. Second, it establishes that the flow control algorithms result in Pareto-optimal allocation of capacities. This implies that the algorithms accomplish optimally fair allocation of resources given the set priorities and preferences. Third, experimental evidence is provided that the algorithms converge rapidly.<<ETX>>},

Several objective functions are considered to be possible replacements of the average packet delay objective function that is widely used in optimal routing algorithms, and evaluated for various network and traffic configurations. A numerical study using the fairness measures developed shows that the objective function which is in the integral form of the average packet delay achieves perfect fairness while sacrificing only a nominal increase in the average packet delay. The numerical study also confirms the conjecture by D.P. Bertsekas and R.G. Gallager (1987) that the form of objective function does not affect the average packet delay in any significant way.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Multiaccess networks in which the shared channel is noisy are considered. A slotted-time collision-type channel, Poisson infinite-user model, and a ternary feedback are assumed. Due to the noise in the shared channel, the received signal may be detected as a collision event though no message or a single message is transmitted. This kind of imperfect feedback is referred to as an error. A common assumption in all previous studies of multiaccess algorithms in channels with errors is that the channel is memoryless. The problem of splitting algorithms when the channel is with memory is considered here. A two-state first-order Markovian model for the channel is introduced and the operation of the tree collision resolution algorithm in this channel is analyzed. A stability result, i.e. the necessary conditions on the channel parameters for stability conditions hold, the throughput of the algorithm is calculated. Extensions to more general channel models are discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Multiple-channel architectures have been proposed for broadcasting-based local area networks to overcome the problem of deteriorating performance when a very high speed communication channel is used. Such networks are called multiple-channel local area networks (M-LANs). In a carrier-sense multiple-access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) protocol designed for M-LANs (M-CSMA/CD), a ready station selects only one channel to transmit its packet according to some channel selection mechanism. A new CSMA/CD protocol for M-LAN architecture is proposed by which a station may select and try to transmit the same packet on K channels (K>or=1). If it has been successfully transmitted on more than one channel after the end-to-end propagation delay, it randomly selects one channel to finish its transmission and immediately stops its transmission on the rest of the channels. This is called the multipacket multichannel CSMA/CD protocol (MM-CSMA/CD). The performance of the proposed MM-CSMA/CD protocol can be shown to be potentially better than that of the M-CSMA/CD protocol and the traditional CSMA/CD protocol.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A distributed asynchronous algorithm is presented for finding two disjoint paths of minimum total length from each possible source node to a destination. The algorithm has both node-disjoint and link-disjoint versions, and provides each node with information sufficient to make incremental routing decisions for forwarding packets over the disjoint paths. For a network in which all links have unit length, it is shown that a synchronous implementation of the algorithm has communication and time complexities O( mod E mod +D mod N mod ) and O(D/sub 2/), respectively, where D is the networks diameter and D/sub 2/ is the maximum, over all nodes i, of the total number of links in the shortest pair of disjoint paths from i to the destination.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A distributed algorithm is presented which finds the shortest path from every node in the network to a given destination node. The network topology is assumed to be organizable into a generalized balanced-tree hierarchy (BH). The BH topology is introduced and characterized, and it is shown that most large interconnected data networks are of this type. It is also shown that the algorithm converges in an asynchronous environment. Therefore, some of the difficulties associated with synchronizing the order of events can be avoided in the actual implementation of the proposed algorithm.<<ETX>>},

For GPDNs, the rearrangeability condition is given and a routing algorithm for the establishment of any set of connection requests is presented. The proposed algorithm operates for GPDNs composed of 2/sup q/*2/sup q/ switching elements and it is able to set up any permutation with a time complexity equal to O(N log/sub 2/ N). The applicability of RDNs, PDNs, and other GPDNs for the implementation of rearrangeable topologies is investigated.

abstract={A fully distributed isochronous channel management protocol based on QPSX which is a major candidate for the IEEE 802.6 metropolitan area network (MAN) is proposed. The system transmits asynchronous traffic and call-setup packets using the distributed queue protocol of QPSX. In the proposed protocol, each station assigns, maintains and deallocates its isochronous channels without communicating with other stations. In order to allocate minimum bandwidth to isochronous traffic, bandwidth allocated to silence calls is used to transmit nonisochronous traffic. At the time of system reconfiguration, channel information is easily modified and communication can continue during recovery. The proposed protocol is compared with the centralized isochronous channel management protocol by simulation. The proposed protocol has shorter data delay, higher isochronous channel utilization, and fewer isochronous slots for same volume of traffic than the centralized protocol.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A network of communicating software tasks in a distributed system is considered. Over the period of interest they are permanent concurrent entities, statically allocated to processors. Tasks communicate by messages sent to ports, sockets, or entries. A task execution is such that for each message received on a certain port, a known average number of other actions takes place, including sending of messages and waiting for replies, or reception of messages on some designated port. Various interesting special cases occur. From the behavior model and parameters of each task, network-wide relationships are obtained that govern the rates of intertask messaging. Certain rates may be taken as independent and they determine the remaining rates. In some cases, a narrowly constrained operating subspace results which contains all feasible task-throughput combinations. The relationships cover a variety of types of tasks and types of communication mechanisms, including rendezvous as well as nonblocking send with blocking receive.<<ETX>>},

The performance of these schemes in terms of the network search rate is dependent on the cache sizes at the nodes and servers, the probability distribution for queuing resources, and the cache replacement policy used to displace resources from the cache to accommodate newly discovered ones. Two policies are investigated: A/sub 0/, which is the optimal policy for the LC scheme, and the least recently used policy, which is of practical importance.<<ETX>>},

In turn, regular priority messages are only served when the system determines, through the repetitive use of circulating tokens, (as used by IEEE 802.5 token ring type protocol) that no high-priority messages are currently waiting in the system. Two token schemes, using different service disciplines, are used to provide network access. Exact mean delay formulas for both message classes are derived. Approximate message delay analysis approaches are also investigated for networks containing large numbers of stations. Numerical results are then exhibited to illustrate the network performance under various traffic conditions.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A very large class of access control strategies is proposed and studied for token passing systems, generalized from the timer-based approach. The idea is to assign transmission quotas dependent on past service times to control the token cycles dynamically while utilizing the token channel efficiently. The dynamics inherent in the control scheme are identified as an important issue and, under heavy load and a few other assumptions, it is shown that the proposed strategies have stable dynamics. Furthermore, the ability of the proposed strategies to control the token cycles is demonstrated. Theoretical results are derived, followed by a thorough discussion on the crucial properties of the new strategies.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Expressions are obtained for the mean excess token holding time for general service time distributions. They were used in the mean message delay approximations for both homogeneous token holding timer (THT) networks and nonhomogeneous THT and token rotating timer networks. Comparisons with simulation results indicated that these approximate formulas are quite accurate. The nonhomogeneous case considered here is only one of many possible mixes of low- and high-priority stations in a network. However, for the purpose of planning manufacturing automation protocol networks, only approximate and worst-case analyses are needed to determine the size of the network and the traffic characteristics for certain performance specifications. The formulas derived here can be used to provide guidance in the choice of timer settings for meeting various priority service requirements.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Timed token protocols are both used to handle, on the same local area network, both real-time and non-real-time traffic. The authors analyze this type of protocols, giving worst-case values for the throughput of non-real-time traffic and the average token rotation time. The results were obtained for synchronous traffic generated according to a generic periodic pattern, under heavy traffic conditions. Finally, it is shown that the difference between the values obtained under worst-case assumptions are close to those obtained under best-case assumptions. Therefore, the method presented here may be used to provide important guidelines so as to properly tune timed token protocol parameters for each specific network installation.<<ETX>>},

The control and observation system links these modules together for configuration, experimentation, and monitoring purposes. There are three phases to using PNPS. first, the various components of a proposed network are designed. Next, the components are combined and run on the hardware while its behavior is monitored.

It is shown that the problem can be reduced to a discrete capacity and flow assignment (CFA) problem. The backbone capacity assignment is inspired by the Lagrangian decomposition approach. It starts from a backbone capacity assignment which matches the initial flow and chooses a backbone server upgrade that gives the greatest response-time reduction per dollar. At this point, the flow deviation method is applied and iteration is continuous until the constraints are met. Several computational examples of network configuration synthesis are presented that emphasize the significance and generality of the results obtained.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Scheduling of voice traffic on broadcast-bus local area networks is considered. A voice scheduling scheme is proposed and evaluated. In this scheme, active voice calls are organized using a distributed global queue. Access scheduling overhead is reduced by voice packet arrival anticipation. To guarantee fairness and to reduce variance of the waiting time, the voice packet build-up during the overhead period is fairly shared among all calls by a round-robin service discipline. Three different voice packet service cases, namely nonexhaustive, exhaustive, and no-queueing, are evaluated. Simple closed-form approximation formulas have been proposed which show good agreement with simulation.

This problem is NP-hard. The problem is formulated here as a linear combinatorial optimization problem. A two-phase algorithm is proposed to obtain good solutions. The first phase is a greedy heuristic algorithm. The second phase is an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation with the subgradient method. This method has been implemented.

abstract={Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) transmission and switching technology is currently under much discussion in the organizations charged with establishing standards for broadband ISDN (BISDN). The focus of these groups has been to establish interfaces based on ATM technology to offer new broadband services to end-users. A migration path from today's circuit-oriented transmission and switching systems is discussed. A three-phased approach is advocated. Phase 1 implies simple broadband capabilities, e.g. basic multiplexing and transport. The POTS-on-fiber efforts fall into this category of broadband deployment. Phase 2 permits the implementation of a subset of broadband interface capabilities to support introduction of specific services (e.g. entertainment video, LAN interconnection, etc.). Phase 3 implements the target broadband user/network interface. A necessary requirement of this approach is that different phases must easily coexist.<<ETX>>},

abstract={It is argued despite its designation as the long-term target transport mode, parameter specifications for ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) have been driven by near-term considerations: in Europe, by the question of compatibility with the existing public network, although voice communications would clearly be a minor service in the presence of most video services: and in North America, by the apparent desire for B-ISDNs to be carriers of connectionless data between local and metropolitan area networks. If it is accepted that for better or for worse, ATM is here to stay, at least in the standards arena, then it must be ensured that the following occur: an international consensus must be reached on ATM system parameters (i.e. cell size, header functionality, etc.), on admission and congestion control techniques, etc.; long-term interests of the telecommunications industry must be reflected in today's standards' developments; and migration strategies must maintain grade-of-service requirements for existing services such as voice.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A distributed algorithm is presented for obtaining an efficient and conflict-free broadcasting schedule in a multi-hop packet radio network. The inherent broadcast nature of the radio channel enables a node's transmission to be received by all other nodes within range. Multiple transmissions can be scheduled simultaneously because of the multi-hop nature of the network. It is first shown that the construction of a broadcasting schedule of minimum length is NP-complete, and then a centralized algorithm based on a sequential graph-coloring heuristic is presented to construct minimal-length schedules. A distributed implementation of this algorithm is then proposed, which is based on circulating a token through the nodes in the network.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A method for delay distribution analysis of window random-access algorithms is presented. The window size is allowed to vary during the operation of the algorithm. It is shown that the quantities of interest can be obtained from the solution of appropriate infinite systems of linear equations. Once the constants and the coefficients of the unknowns of a system are determined, bounds on the solution can be developed by applying previously developed methodologies. The method is applied to the delay distribution analysis of the Capetanakis's window random-access algorithm and the part-and-try algorithm, both under binary C-NC feedback.<<ETX>>},

year={1989},
volume={},
number={},
pages={512-519 vol.2},
abstract={A general method is introduced that is capable of improving network capacity by altering connectivity values and can be used on a wide range of packet radio network topologies, traffic requirements, and protocols. The approach uses artificial intelligence techniques to formulate design rules which quantitatively describe individual aspects of the capacity/connectivity dependence. Incorporation of the design rules into a rule-based computer optimization program produces, on average, 15-25% capacity improvement for both random and regular network inputs. Optimization results lead to conclusions about efficient network topology and operation, and permit further capacity/connectivity generalizations. The approach used, as well as many of the rules developed, go beyond the domain of packet radio networks, and are applicable to many general network design problems.<<ETX>>},

title={A buffered two-node packet radio network with product form solution},
year={1989},
volume={},
number={},
pages={520-528 vol.2},
abstract={A packet radio network is considered with two nodes; both nodes access a single radio channel using the slotted-ALOHA protocol. This model results in a queuing network with two interfering queues. Networks of interfering queues such as this seldom have closed-form expressions for the equilibrium probabilities; however, when the new-packet arrival rate is properly controlled, the network will have a product-form solution. This control is called PFS-control. When operating under PFS-control, the interfering queuing network has a simple, closed-form expression for the equilibrium probabilities, the expected throughput, and the expected packet delay. Necessary and sufficient conditions for network stability are derived.<<ETX>>},

year={1989},
volume={},
number={},
pages={529-537 vol.2},
abstract={An N*N nonblocking packet switch with two priority classes which can be used to support traffics with different requirements is analyzed. Real-time traffic such as voice is assigned high priority to satisfy its strict delay requirement, while data traffic uses a lower priority and utilizes the remaining system capacity. The switch operation is slotted, and at each time slot packets arrivals at the inputs have Bernoulli distributions with different probabilities for high-priority and low-priority classes. Packets of both priority classes can be queued when waiting for service; the service discipline is FCFS (first-come first-served) within each priority class. The authors provide explicit expressions for blocking probabilities and average delays. They also study system stability and show that the maximum throughput can in fact be higher than with no priority.<<ETX>>},

pages={538-547 vol.2},
abstract={The performance of a nonblocking space-division packet switch is studied given that traffics are imbalanced at input and output. Analysis shows that the performance of packet queuing delay at switch input, as well as the entire throughput of the switch, can be adversely affected by such imbalances. The work is then extended to examine a transient imbalance case, where the switch experiences the alternation of two transient periods, each at a different traffic imbalance mode. The alternation is modeled by a two-state Markov chain. Both balanced and imbalanced cases can be viewed as the two extremes of the transient case. It is observed that the system throughput and the queuing performance in the transient case heavily depend on both mean sojourn time and steady-state probability at each imbalance mode.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Some data-link layer error control go-back-N ARQ (automatic repeat-request) protocols are studied that are suitable for point-to-multipoint communication over broadcast channels where data are delivered to the destinations in the order they are sent. A series of protocols differing in the way that the sender uses the outcomes of the previous transmissions are studied. The system delay, rather than the throughput, is the optimization measure. The optimal number of copies that the sender should transmit to minimize the time between when the sender first transmits a data frame and when the data frame is accepted by all the receivers is determined. The results show that sending the optimum number of copies of a data frame instead of just a single copy significantly improved the delay performance.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A new method is discussed for modifying majority-logic convolutional decoders for use in a type-I hybrid-ARQ protocol. In standard forward error correcting (FEC) operation, these decoders generate reliability information in the form of orthogonal sets of parity check sums. The modified decoder uses this information to identify received packets whose decoded data may be unreliable and to request retransmission of these packets. It is shown through analysis and simulation that the resulting error control system provides substantially higher data reliability than its FEC counterpart at the expense of a very small reduction in data throughput.<<ETX>>},

Three classes of adaptive window schemes, all of which use implicit detection, are examined. In all of them, receiving a REJECT frame (which is sent by the far end when it receives an out-of-sequence frame) is interpreted as a sign of congestion, and the control action taken by the end-systems is in the form of reducing their layer-2 window. It is shown that these schemes perform fairly well over a wide range of network parameters and traffic patterns, with one in particular providing a very robust performance over the range. It involves reducing the window size to 1/2 upon receiving a REJECT frame.<<ETX>>},

Finally, the use of frame relay as a transport mechanism is described for all forms of packet-oriented traffic in private networks, focusing in particular on the synergy between the use of Q.931 procedures with appropriate extensions for inner-node signaling and the use of frame-relay to transport Q.931 messages within the network.

abstract={The performance is analyzed of the congestion control scheme in signaling system no.7 (SS7). Unlike many other congestion control schemes used in data networks, a threshold control along with a choking mechanism is used in this scheme. Two analytic models are developed that are used to study the steady-state performance and the triggering behavior of the congestion control scheme. Both models are amenable to simple solution techniques. Numerical examples are provided that reveal the dynamics of the congestion control scheme with respect to various control parameters. From these results, a set of guidelines is elaborated for the determination of congestion control parameters that will result in good performance of the signaling network.<<ETX>>},

title={A congestion control framework for ATM networks},
year={1989},
volume={},
number={},
pages={701-710 vol.2},
abstract={A congestion control framework for ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks is proposed. Specifically, it is suggested that the network provide two different services: express service and first-class service. Express service is appropriate for real-time applications (e.g., voice and video) whereas first-class service is appropriate for non-real-time applications (e.g., data). To provide such services, the proposed congestion control scheme prevents congestion inside the network by controlling the congestion at two levels: virtual circuit (VC) level and packet level. Express VC traffic is not subject to any flow control. At each intermediate node, transit packets are simply relayed with no traffic control. Various issues related to this scheme are discussed and its performance analyzed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The performance is compared of first-in-first-out and round-robin packet service disciplines at the trunk nodes of byte-stream networks, including priority service for single-packet messages. Delay and throughput characteristics are surveyed as a function of traffic mix, packet size, traffic intensity, and the ratio of trunk speed to access line speed. Exact and approximate analyses are compared with the results of simulations. Under normal traffic conditions, most disciplines will give acceptable mean delay if the ratio of trunk speed to access line speed is sufficiently high. Under congestion, round-robin disciplines have better fairness properties than first-in-first-out disciplines, in that they protect well-behaved users against hogs.<<ETX>>},

pages={731-739 vol.2},
abstract={The problem of sharing jobs among a set of parallel queues is discussed. The system is heterogeneous in the sense that different servers may have different speeds. Socially optimal policies that minimize the mean response time of all jobs ar of interest. Using semi-Markov decision processes, it is shown that an optimal policy that uses the instantaneous queue length independent of system utilization does not exist. Rather, the optimal decision of assigning a job to a server depends on the workload intensity. At light loads, the optimal policy tends to assign most jobs to fast servers. At heavy loads, slower servers are used to offload fast ones. Simulation results indicate that a simple heuristic, i.e., a generalization of the optimal policy for homogeneous systems derived from the analytic results, yields substantial performance improvement compared with no load sharing and outperforms the join-shortest-queue policy.<<ETX>>},

pages={740-748 vol.2},
abstract={A specific threshold load-balancing policy is described and analyzed for distributed computer systems in which each node executes job according to a priority schedule that depends on where the job originates. An approximate analysis is carried out to obtain the mean response time performance of the system in closed-form expression. In the analysis, it is assumed that the job transfers between nodes are Poisson processes. It is proved that the Poisson assumption on the job transfers is asymptotically exact (and hence the performance predictions of the model is asymptotically exact) as the number of nodes in the system increases. Simulations studies reveal that the Poisson job transfer assumption is good for small systems containing several nodes when one is interested in obtaining the response time performance of the system.<<ETX>>},

The state of the network is represented by the total number of packets for which the source has not yet received an acknowledgement.

The objective is to maximize the throughput of the network so that the end-to-end expected packet time delay does not exceed an upper bound. The optimal flow control is shown to be of a window type, while the routing policy balances the traffic inside the network. Several load-balancing algorithms are evaluated.<<ETX>>},

pages={758-765 vol.2},
abstract={A new resource allocation model is presented in which a given number of copies of a single resource are allocated to the processing sites in such a way that the total communication cost incurred is minimized. The accessing scheme considers both the communication costs and the load levels at the resource sites. Load leveling is imposed as a constraint. This improves system throughput as well as response time. The allocation provided by the model reflects the realistic environment more accurately and therefore gives a better dynamic performance. It is shown that the model can be extended to include other costs such as installation cost and communication cost due to 'write' accesses.<<ETX>>},

abstract={GAM-T-103 is a French military standard specifying services provided by a real-time transport layer called the transfer layer. The main features of connection-oriented services are described. Three such features are evaluated: automatic point-to-point sampling, centralized multicast and centralized concentration. In order to compare GAM-T-103 with the ISO 8073 protocol, a generic model has been developed and implemented under a simulation tool called SPHINX. Simulation results highlight the benefits resulting from GAM-T-103 protocols: lower resource utilization ratios and better response times. GAM-T-103 protocols take advantage of the multicast capacity inherent with broadcast LANs and they relieve user application software from tedious tasks such as those related to periodic data transmissions or multipeer data transmissions.<<ETX>>},

year={1989},
volume={},
number={},
pages={774-783 vol.3},
abstract={The performance of several policies for scheduling real-time and non-real-time messages in a statistical multiplexer is examined. The performance metric for the real-time traffic is the percentage of messages not transmitted within their deadlines; the performance metric for the non-real-time traffic is the average delay. The scheduling policies are: (1) first-come first-served (FCFS); (2) head of the line priority, in which real-time packets are given priority; (3) minimum-laxity threshold (MLT) policy; and (4) queue-length threshold (QLT) policy. Under the MLT policy, priority is given to the real-time traffic when the minimum laxity is below some threshold. The QLT policy gives priority to the non-real-time traffic whenever the number of queued non-real-time packets is above some threshold. Results show that the FCFS policy causes relatively high losses for the real-time traffic while providing relatively low message delays for the non-real-time traffic; the converse holds true for the strict priority discipline. Both the MLT and QLT disciplines allow the designer to explicitly trade off the performance realized by each traffic class by using an appropriately chosen value for the threshold parameter. Little difference is observed in the performance tradeoffs available, so it is concluded that the QLT policy is more practical, as it is simpler to implement.<<ETX>>},

number={},
pages={784-791 vol.3},
abstract={The authors address the problem of flow control and routing of real-time traffic in a network, where messages must arrive at their destination within given deadlines if they are not to be considered lost. Performance in this case is measured in terms of the probability of losing a message. For the case of n parallel links, the problem is formulated as one of optimal flow allocation and solved under general conditions. It is shown that for a FCFS (first-come first-served) service discipline an admission policy rejecting messages before link assignment is optimal when the load exceeds a critical value. Thus, the authors take advantage of the fact that if some messages will exceed their deadlines anyway, it is beneficial not to admit them in the first place. An efficient algorithm for explicitly solving the problem is presented and specific examples are analyzed. The authors also discuss the applicability of online algorithms for this problem when modeling assumptions cannot be made.<<ETX>>},

year={1989},
volume={},

pages={792-799 vol.3},
abstract={The problem of routing in a circuit-switched network with different classes of traffic is examined. The authors consider the case of two priority classes, assuming that a relatively small fraction of traffic comprises the high-priority class requiring a better grade of service, with the rest being treated as lower priority normal traffic. These high-priority calls might be used to provide a premium service with lower blocking probability, or to implement services in which failure is expensive to the network such as a multiparty conference call. The authors identify several routing schemes that give preference to high-priority calls, either by explicitly reserving capacity or by allowing more resource sharing. The performance of these schemes is studied in terms of blocking probabilities for the two classes, protection of priority traffic against overload of normal traffic, and adaptability to variations in offered priority traffic. The authors compare the schemes by the different total revenues they earn and discuss the implementation complexity. They find that some resource-sharing schemes display good performance, having the potential to provide low blocking for priority calls with minimal impact on the remaining normal traffic.<<ETX>>},

pages={800-809 vol.3},
abstract={The Manhattan Street Network (MS-Net) and Shuffle-Exchange Network (SX-Net) are two-connected networks with significantly different topologies. Fixed-size packets are transmitted between nodes in these networks. The nodes are synchronized so that all of the packets that are received by a node within a slot transmission time arrive at a switching point simultaneously. Instead of storing large numbers of packets at intermediate nodes, a deflection strategy similar to hot-potato routing is used. There are characteristics of the MS-Net that make it well suited for deflection routing. With no buffer, 55-70% of the throughput with an infinite number of buffers has been obtained; with a single buffer per node, the throughput increases to 80-90%. With uniform load the throughput does not decrease significantly as the network utilization increases. Therefore, additional flow control mechanisms are not required to achieve the highest network throughput. The SX-Net does not have the above characteristics of the MS-Net. However, deflection routing still provides a significant portion of the available throughput. In the SX-Net, more buffers are required than in the MS-Net, and a flow control mechanism must be used to achieve the greatest throughput.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A novel gateway design (referred to as T-SWIFT) is presented for integrating the flow of voice streams into existing broadband cable systems. The interface between the integrated voice subnetwork and the cable system is realized by a metropolitan area gateway (MAG) which is implemented at the broadband cable head-end. In T-SWIFT, an intelligent scheduling algorithm in the MAG dynamically allocates channel bandwidth using a variation of the data switch-filtering and fixed-frame synchronous voice/data integration techniques introduced by the author (see IEEE J. Selected Areas in Commun. vol., SAC-5, no.9, p.1391-1402 (1987)). The MAG accomplishes this by coordinating the transmission of inbound and outbound voice talkspurts in an upwardly compatible fashion with respect to the existing CSMA/CD data stations. Thus previously installed stations require no modification. Results are presented which indicate that the T-SWIFT design performs significantly better than previous compatible voice/data integration methods.<<ETX>>},

abstract={Two flow control schemes are investigated. In Scheme A, messages are allowed into the gateway buffer until it reaches its capacity, at which point they are blocked and made to wait at their respective input buffers. When capacity becomes available at the output buffer, the messages are allowed into the output again on a first-come-first-serve basis. Scheme B is based on an optimal throughput scheme which is derived using a process involving linear programming. In this scheme, the output buffer reserves its spaces for those input buffers that have a temporarily higher demand for spaces than their own buffers can offer. Simulation results confirm that Scheme B produces a better throughput performance than Scheme A. However, this is obtained at the expense of a higher delay. A constraint on the delay can be introduced when deriving Scheme B, but this is expected to lower the maximum throughput achievable.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors investigate the delay-throughput performance of this protocol operating under either equal or nonuniform load conditions based on the fairness criterion of equal average packet delay. Because of the complexity of the system, an approximate analytical model for selecting the p/sub i/ for this fairness criterion is developed. The p/sub i/ that satisfy the fairness criterion are determined from a Markov chain model for the protocol. The authors begin by considering the finite-buffer case and then proceed to the infinite-buffer one. They find that the performance of the protocol is insensitive to bus length, data rate, and the number of stations on the network. Hence, the network is suitable for long-distance, high-bandwidth applications as in fiber-optic local and metropolitan area systems. Simulation studies which serve to establish the range of validity of the analytical model are presented.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An investigation is made of the stability and dynamic behavior of ALOHA-type protocols used in very small aperture terminal (VSAT) networks that support bursty, interactive data sources. A simulation model has been developed for dynamic performance analysis of unslotted ALOHA and selective reject (SREJ) ALOHA channels and used to obtain quantitative measures of stability in terms of transient response to pulsed traffic overload. For a typical 56-kb/s interactive station VSAT channel, the dependence is examined of pulse response (summarized in terms of a quantity called the backlog fall time) on selectable protocol parameters such as average transmission delays for nonadaptive systems or backoff policy parameters for adaptive systems. These results are augmented with average delay simulations, to obtain characteristic delay versus fall-time contours that permit the designer to select protocol parameters yielding the optimum combination of nominal steady-state and dynamic performance. For the ALOHA and SREJ-ALOHA channels under consideration, a surprisingly well-defined optimum region (in the form of a knee in the delay versus fall-time curves) is generally found to exist, underscoring the value of the joint steady-state/dynamic response design methodology proposed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The effects of the message length statistics on the mean message response time and message and packet access delays are investigated for variable-length multipacket messages transmitted over CSMA-CD (carrier-sense multiple-access with collision detection) local area networks. The steady-state distribution of the number of messages in the system is determined using the imbedded Markov chain technique and limiting results from renewal theory. Application of Little's law then yields the mean message response time, from which the mean message and packet access delays are determined easily due to the gated transmission strategy adopted. Sample numerical results are presented for geometrically and truncated Poisson-distributed message lengths. It is concluded from the numerical results that the access delays as well as the mean response time are sensitive not only to the message length statistics but also to the message length distribution and the node buffer size.<<ETX>>},

In particular, they provide and study various properties of a simple algorithm which stations execute independently by using channel feedback information. This results in a fully distributed control mechanism that continuously adjusts the station probabilities p/sub i/ at their proper levels as governed by the ordered traffic, where the p/sub i/ are parameters of the p/sub i/-persistent protocol.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The potential of incorporating electronically controlled photonic switching components in fiber-optic ring-based communication networks is explored. Possible extensions to fiber ring architectures with lithium niobate switches are proposed, and potential problems that limit wide-scale use of these devices are identified. The use of 2*2 directional couplers to provide faulty node bypass is investigated. This concept is extended to larger photonic switches with multiple fibers to provide higher throughput. This approach also provides multiple redundant paths that enable the network to be reconfigured based on traffic demands and faults on the ring. The concept of distributing switching capabilities among all the nodes in a network is introduced. Two networks with distributed switching capabilities are examined. Switching parameters that impact the application of photonic devices in ring networks are discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A novel class of switching networks has been proposed to remove the time and space bottlenecks in conventional RAM-controlled switching architectures.

abstract={Emerging applications require a substantially higher bandwidth than the one offered by current networks. The authors propose a novel architectural approach that meets the high bandwidth requirements by introducing a communication architecture based on lightpaths, which are purely optical transmission paths in the network. Since lightpaths form the building block of the proposed architecture, its performance hinges on their efficient establishment and management. The authors shown that although the problem of optimally establishing lightpaths is NP-complete, distributed heuristics provide near-optimal solutions for several of the basic problems presented by the lightpath architecture.<<ETX>>},

abstract={An analysis is conducted of an M/G/1 queue with server vacations and gated time-limited service. The authors derive a functional equation which characterizes the amount of work, U/sub p/, at the server's return from a vacation. To solve the equation, they use a numerical technique in which the complementary cumulative function for U/sub p/ is closely approximated by a weighted sum of Laguerre functions with unknown coefficients. The functional equation is transformed into a set of linear equations from which the coefficients can be computed. Using the work-decomposition and PASTA (Poisson Arrivals Sec Time Averages) properties, the average customer waiting time can be readily obtained. Several numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity of the technique. The model studied is applicable to analyzing a specific recently proposed communication channel that alternately serves voice and data traffic, token-passing networks with token-holding timers, and other communication and computer systems where times are used to allocate service among multiple types of customers.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A method is developed which allows the application of Norton's theorem on queuing networks with finite capacities. A node is arbitrarily selected and the subnetwork containing all remaining nodes is replaced by a composite node with infinite capacity; thus the entire network is reduced to a two-node network having the node of interest and the composite node. Although blocking causes interdependencies between nodes in the network, the selected node is totally isolated from the rest of the network by constructing phases in the server which reflect the blocking events. An algorithm is given to compute the parameters of the phases. Several examples are discussed to demonstrate the efficiency and generality of the technique. Comparisons with simulation results show that the proposed technique provides accurate results for throughput values.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A performance study is presented of the proposed IEEE 802.6 standard (DQDB MAN) used as a backbone loop network in packet-switching mode to interconnect token rings that operate as specified in the ANSI/IEEE 802.5 standard. Interconnection between DQDB and token rings is provided by gateways that use assembly and segmentation processors and limited buffer sizes. The authors consider a network architecture in which Type 2 of the IEEE 802.2 logical-link-control (LLC) standard is used as end-to-end protocol between stations on the token rings. The use of the former and current DQDB slot formats are compared. Several window sizes, different policy schemes, and various traffic intensities and bit rates in token rings are also considered. Using the current DQDB slot size, results show that higher access priority should be allocated to the gateways in the token rings and also show the importance of reducing the time caused by the segmentation of packets in the gateways.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The authors establish upper and lower bounds for the number of crosspoints required in a one-sided crosspoint switching network to provide a given level of connectivity. Two modes of operation are considered, namely, nonblocking and rearrangeable. A complete nonblocking switch matrix with N ports has N/sup 2//2 crosspoints. The authors show that this number can be reduced by at most N/2-1 crosspoints for nonblocking operation. If rearrangeable operation is allowed, however, as many as 25% of the crosspoints can be removed. An analysis is made of the relationship between the number of crosspoints removed and the maximum number of rearrangements of connections needed. Also introduced are algorithms for rearrangement of connections in both single-chip and partitioned implementations with reduced numbers of crosspoints.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A model is presented for the reliability and performance analysis of systems where components can go through degraded states in a statistically dependent manner. The model, called the cause-based multimode model (CBMM), is based on the idea that deviations of components from the 'up' state have underlying physical causes which can be explicitly identified and are statistically independent. The effects of several causes can be combined in a flexible manner. System reliability/performance measures can be computed by an approximation method, based on the consideration of the most probable states. Such states can be efficiently generated by using algorithms developed for an earlier multimode, independent-failure model by S.N. Chiou and V.O.K. Li (see IEEE J.

The six most important direct consequences of the network architecture are the topology's: (1) ease of expansion; (2) fast, on-the-fly self-routing; (3) extremely high tolerance to network faults; (4) increased network security; (5) potential for the total elimination of store-and-forward transmissions due to routing decision delays; and (6) rendering the maximum path length issue moot.<<ETX>>},

year={1989},
volume={},

pages={989-997 vol.3},
abstract={A counter-rotating dual ring incorporates a reconfiguration capability that significantly increases the reliability of a ring local area network. Automatic wrapping and merging reconfiguration techniques without specific supervising station are presented. Stations are connected by two link pairs, each consisting of an incoming signal link and an autograph signal link. In normal operation two rings are formed. A primary ring is used for user data transmission, and a secondary is used for backup. When a failure occurs on the primary ring, either ring switch or wrapping takes place. Ring switch means that the secondary ring assumes the roll of the primary ring. Wrapping means that the signal from the input side of one link pair is turned around to the output side of the same link pair to avoid the failure. This automatic wrapping mechanism restores a closed ring and can be used with the case of MAC (media access control) layer failure as well as physical layer failure. The station continues to monitor the failed links; when the failure is remedied, the failed portion forms another wrapped ring. The two wrapped rings are then combined together (merging) after it is certified that they are both functioning properly. If another failure occurs on the wrapped ring, the same wrapping mechanism enables smaller wrapped rings to be formed.<<ETX>>},

This eliminates the needs of a large public field and the exchange of private or public keys. The major advantage of the ID-based cryptosystem based on this scheme over other published ID-based cryptosystems is that the number of users can be extended to t*L users without degrading the system's security even when users conspire, where L is the number of the system's secrets, and t is the number of factors in p-1, where p is a large prime number.<<ETX>>},

The focus is on so-called stream traffic in which each class is allocated different quantities of bandwidth for the duration of a call. An exact analysis of the blocking conditions experienced by different classes of traffic demanding transmission through an N/sub 1/*N/sub 0/ switch is presented. No particular structure is assumed for the switch besides its capability of resolving output port contention by rearranging the input traffic. A two-dimensional generalization of an analysis for a single trunk is considered. Its efficiency rests on the linearity of the necessary computations, thus the relative independence from the dimensionality of the switch.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A two-component simplification of the powerful Poissonian-spectrum method of analyzing a loss system serving a mixture of a nonPoissonian multi-bit-rate traffic system is proposed. The spectrum concept is implicit in L.E.N. Delbrouck's (1981) recursions for homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic and has its roots in Hayward's rather simplistic, yet accurate, method for treating homogeneous peaked traffic. The Poissonian-spectrum representation is not unique. To determine the sensitivity of the method to the spectrum shape, a study is made of three distinctly different representations. With appropriate selection of the spectrum shape, the method reduces to simple recursions. A layman's approach is used to derive these recursions as a natural extension of the Roberts-Kaufman recursion. The case of smooth traffic requires careful considerations, which are discussed.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A model is considered which has several classes of customers arriving in independent Poisson processes at a multiserver facility and requiring a specific number of servers for a random period of time (arbitrarily distributed with a finite mean). If these servers cannot be provided, the customers are cleared. The problem is to determine the blocking probabilities. The exact expression is available but is complicated. The authors apply a novel approximation method of ensemble averaging for the asymptotic analysis of blocking in such systems. The method gives simple expressions for the average performance measures without an explicit computation of the normalization constant of the steady-state probability distribution.

abstract={An investigation is conducted of routing in packet-switched networks that consist of two individually controlled domains. Each domain controller determines a static routing plan for requirements that are contained within its domain and for requirements that are addressed to nodes in the other domain. The authors propose two routing algorithms, assuming that each controller has limited information on the configuration of the other domain. Numerical examples are provided that compare the delay performance of such algorithms with the optimal routing of a centralized scheme that has full information and control over both domains. Implications of distributed control on network design are explored.<<ETX>>},

year={1989},
volume={},

pages={1057-1062 vol.3},
abstract={A novel connection request procedure for a land mobile satellite system (LMSS) is described. The procedure is based on a binary-feedback free-access collision resolution algorithm (CRA) operating over a number of parallel channels. This protocol is shown to achieve a much higher stable throughput than the previously recommended modified slotted ALOHA protocol for making connection requests. The complexity involved in implementing such a protocol is inherently low. Furthermore, this protocol is superior to other multiple-channel obvious blocked-access CRA protocols. By interleaving the time slots among individual channels, it can be applied to multiple-channel land mobile satellite type systems. Simulation results are obtained that demonstrate stable performance up to capacity. Moreover, the delay throughput characteristic is extremely flat over a wide range of traffic input rates.<<ETX>>},

pages={1063-1071 vol.3},
abstract={With the advent of high-speed networks, there has been a tendency to simplify flow/congestion control functions at lower levels of the OSI model and relegate them to higher levels. This paper shows that a class of traffic, namely host-to-host file transfers, can experience severe degradation in performance due to lack of proper control in such networks. A simple distributed rate-based flow control scheme is proposed which solves the problem without affecting the performance of the network. The scheme is easily implemented, with control totally distributed and managed by the sources. The rate is negotiated at call setup time and entails very little overhead. A detailed simulation model is built to quantify the problems and verify the solution.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The author considers the possibility of obtaining performance gains by using channel power sensing in the channel access protocol of a terrestrial spread-spectrum packet radio network as a generalization of the CSMA (carrier-sense multiple-access) protocol of narrowband networks. Channel load sensing is viewed as a method of estimating the interference at the receiver based on the interference measured at the transmitter. To do this, a bivariate probability distribution function of the interference at the two locations is required. The probability of packet success is then determined. Since it is difficult to evaluate numerically, a program was written to simulate it. The author gives simulation results for the case of a random network.<<ETX>>},

pages={1078-1083 vol.3},
abstract={The authors present two adaptive techniques, involving route selection and channel access, which significantly improve the throughput and delay performance of a multihop, receiver-directed CDMA (code-division multiple-access) packet radio network. Routing is accomplished by choosing among potential next nodes in a distribution fashion, based on the simple metric of queue length. De facto preference is given to congested nodes by the channel access protocol, based on queue length ratios, in order to increase their (outbound) throughput without increasing the number of channel collisions. These algorithms have the effect of spreading network traffic more evenly across the network, thereby alleviating the congestion at bottleneck nodes, so that network throughput approaches that analytically predicted using a homogeneity assumption. Simulation results are presented which quantify the achieved improvement for networks with varying connectivity fractions.<<ETX>>},

abstract={A model is proposed for analyzing the performance of a mobile packet radio network. In this network, a node is allowed to move around with a random velocity. Hence, the distribution of the number of nodes in one's transmission circle is dependent on the mobility of the nodes. A queuing model is developed to evaluate this distribution and the effects of node mobility on system performance. This effect cannot be obtained by classical two-dimensional Poisson model. It is found that an optimal power radius is dependent on the node mobility.<<ETX>>},

year={1989},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1089-1097 vol.3},
abstract={An analytical model is presented for computing the end-to-end voice call performance in a packet network which drops the less significant bits in voice packets during periods of congestion. The authors first modify an existing single-node bit-dropping model to include the situation when the overall arrival process at a node consists of a mix of packets of different sizes. Variability in packet size is caused by bit dropping at previous nodes. A detailed model is presented to capture bit dropping effects in a tandem connection of nodes. The model includes the effects of load fluctuations at each node, and also takes into account the dependencies in bit dropping experienced by a voice packet at successive nodes in a tandem connection. These dependencies occur because a packet that has experienced bit dropping at a node in congestion state Q would not be further bit-dropped at a subsequent node if its current congestion state is no worse than Q. The model also incorporates the reduction in packet service times at intermediate nodes due to dropping at previous nodes. In addition to the detailed model, the authors present two approximation procedures which also serve as upper and lower bounds. In particular, the upper bound is shown to be very tight for practical range of loads, and hence serves as a good approximation with significant computational simplicity.<<ETX>>},

year={1989},

pages={1098-1105 vol.3},
abstract={A replacement technique for lost speech packets is presented. This technique is based on the classification of the packets into four distinct classes: background noise, voiced speech, fricatives, and other. Different encoding schemes and lost packet replacement techniques are used for each class. Results of subjective tests indicate that giving preferential delivery treatment to packets based on class can be used to improve subjective quality. The replacement strategy renders the reconstructed signal indistinguishable from the original utterance for packet loss rates up to 47% for background noise packets, 8% for fricative packets, and 4% for other packets. For voiced packets, the replacement is distinguishable from the original signal even for packet loss rates lower than 5%, but significant improvement may be possible by reducing the memory associated with the voiced speech coding process.<<ETX>>},

abstract={The chief cause of packet loss is the variability of end-to-end delay due to queuing at intermediate nodes. The queuing discipline used within the network directly affects this delay variance. In an integrated environment, scheduling must provide adequate performance for all classes. Simulation was used to compare the performance of several queuing disciplines for trunk scheduling at a packet switch with only voice traffic. A delay-dependent priority scheme, the budgeted residual-life-dependent discipline (BURD), resulted in the lowest packet loss rate at the node. BURD and a head-of-line discipline were then used to construct scheduling policies for networks with integrated traffic. It was found possible to approximate the performance of the delay-dependent priority schemes using more easily implemented head-of-line schemes and still provide adequate service for data traffic.<<ETX>>},
