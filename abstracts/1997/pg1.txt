abstract={A (large) multicast ATM switch with an external structure of output queueing and an internal structure of buffered MINs (multistage interconnection networks) is considered, where the buffered MINs (also called a switching network) are composed of switching elements with shared buffer output queueing. A cell replication while routing scheme is used in the switch to implement the multicast function. In this paper, we study the performance of the switch with multicast traffic, mainly via computer simulations. The multicast traffic can be random and bursty. From our study we found that for multicast traffic with a truncated geometric distribution of cell fanouts it has only a slightly worse impact on the performance of the switching elements in isolation or in the last stage of the switching network. The multicast traffic has no worse effect on the switch output buffer behaviour and cell delay in the switching network. Moreover, traffic splitting can substantially improve the switching network performance for highly bursty traffic. Some analytical approximations are given which could be useful in the dimensioning of switching networks.},

abstract={In this paper, we design and analyze a growable multicast ATM switch. It can grow to a large size since both cell routing and contention resolution are designed to distribute over the switch elements, and the switch structure is modular. The output ports are partitioned into groups to permit sharing of routing paths. The concept of group routing helps reduce an order of magnitude of switch elements. A two-stage switch architecture is described to illustrate our design principle. The switch can be easily expanded to a larger size by using more stages. The performance analysis of the switch in terms of cell loss rate, cell delay, mean queue length, mean waiting time, and throughput is conducted using the M/Geom/1 model. Experimental results show that the proposed ATM switch not only meets the ATM performance requirements either for unicasting or multicasting but also uses fewer switch elements and has less delay than other comparable switches.},

abstract={In this paper, we study multicasting in the self-routing multistage interconnection networks (MINs) for asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch architectures. Many B-ISDN applications require multicast connections in addition to conventional point-to-point connections. This paper presents a novel approach to support multicast connection, on the basis of a restricted address encoding scheme which constructs a short fixed-size multicast header and a recursive scheme that recycles a multicast packet one or more times through the network to send it to the desired destinations. The proposed two-phase multicast algorithm provides deadlock-free multiple multicast connections in MIN-based ATM switches. The emphasis is on analyzing the performance of an unbuffered MIN-based switch using the multicast algorithm in terms of network throughput. The proposed algorithm can be easily applied to buffered MIN-based ATM switches.},

abstract={A newly proposed large-scale ATM switch called the cross-path switch has been shown to be capable of handling multirate traffic efficiently. We study two replication approaches to enhance the switch to support multicasting. The first approach replicates multicast cells at both the input and output stages, while the second one replicates cells at the input stage only. A feasible configuration for each scheme is considered and the effect of multicast traffic on the switch performance in terms of the throughput and cell loss probability is studied. We observed that, to achieve the same throughput and loss requirement, the second architecture may require fewer switching elements than the first one.},

abstract={ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) systems can support services with bursty traffic. An ATM system needs a sophisticated and real-time connection admission controller not only to guarantee the required quality-of-service (QoS) for existing calls but also to raise the system efficiency. The input process has a power-spectral-density (PSD) which explicitly contains the correlation behavior of input traffic and has a great impact on the system performance. Also, a neural network has been widely applied to deal with traffic control related problems in ATM systems because of its self-learning capability. We propose a PSD-based neural-net connection admission control (PNCAC) method for an ATM system. Under the QoS constraint, we construct a decision hyperplane of the connection admission control according to parameters of the power spectrum. We further adopt the learning/adapting capabilities of the neural network to adjust the optimum location of the boundary between these two decision spaces. Simulation results show that the PNCAC method provides a superior system utilization over the conventional CAC schemes by as much as 18%, while keeping the QoS contract.},

We propose and develop a multi-class connection admission control (CAC) policy that supports cell loss and delay requirements. In this model-based CAC, the source traffic is described in terms of the usage parameter control (UPC) parameters. Through careful analysis and approximations, we derive simple closed-form formulas to calculate the bandwidth required to meet guarantees on quality of service (QoS).

pages={990-997 vol.3},
abstract={The two main operating constraints of today's multimedia servers are the I/O bandwidth and communication bandwidth limitations. Both of these problems are addressed in this paper using a novel technique called Earthworm. In this scheme, the network memory is used as a huge cache for buffering multimedia data. Dramatic reduction in the demand on the I/O bandwidth, therefore, can be achieved. This scheme also chains display stations to allow them to forward video streams. This strategy eliminates the congestion at the communication port of the server. Removing this bottleneck allows our technique to operate on the vast aggregate bandwidth of the WAN rather than being constrained by the very limited local bandwidth available to the server. A unique feature of the Earthworm approach is that every display station using the server attempts to make some contribution to the caching space and communication bandwidth. The arrival of a new request, therefore, can be seen as a contributor, rather than just a burden to the server. This characteristic ensures the scalability of our design to support very large multimedia applications.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel algorithm for taking checkpoints and rolling back the processes for recovery in asynchronous distributed systems. The algorithm has the following properties: (1) multiple processes can simultaneously initiate the checkpointing; (2) no additional message is transmitted for taking checkpoints; (3) a set of local checkpoints taken by multiple processes denotes a consistent global state; (4) multiple processes can initiate simultaneously the rollback recovery; (5) the minimum number of processes are rolled back; and (6) each process is rolled back asynchronously. The number of messages for rolling back the processes is O(l) where l is the number of channels. Therefore, the system is kept highly available by the algorithm presented.},

abstract={In noncooperative networks, resources are shared among selfish users, which optimize their individual performance measure. We consider the generic and practically important case of atomic resource sharing, in which traffic bifurcation is not implemented, hence each user allocates its whole traffic to one of the network resources. We analyze topologies of parallel resources within a game-theoretic framework and establish several fundamental properties. We prove the existence of and convergence to a Nash equilibrium. For a broad class of residual capacity performance functions, an upper bound on the number of iterations till convergence is derived. An algorithm is presented for testing the uniqueness of the equilibrium. Sufficient conditions for achieving a feasible equilibrium are obtained. We consider extensions to general network topologies. In particular, we show that, for a class of throughput-oriented cost functions, existence of and convergence to a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed in all topologies. With these structural results at hand, we establish the foundations of a design and management methodology, that enables one to operate such networks efficiently, in spite of the lack of cooperation among users and the restrictions imposed by atomic resource sharing.},

abstract={Replication is a commonly proposed solution to problems of scale associated with distributed services. However, when a service is replicated, each client must be assigned a server. Prior work has generally assumed the assignment to be static. In contrast, we propose a dynamic server selection, and show that it enables application-level congestion avoidance. Using tools to measure the available bandwidth and round trip latency (RTT), we demonstrate the dynamic server selection and compare it to previous static approaches. We show that because of the variability of paths in the Internet, dynamic server selection consistently outperforms static policies, reducing response times by as much as 50%. However, we also must adopt a systems perspective and consider the impact of the measurement method on the network. Therefore, we look at alternative low-cost approximations and find that the careful measurements provided by our tools can be closely approximated by much lighter-weight measurements. We propose a protocol using this method which is limited to at most a 1% increase in network traffic but which often costs much less in practice.},

A centralized (i.e., star) network topology is adopted as the topology of a cell which consists of a base station and a number of mobile clients. Dynamic time division duplexed (TDD) transmission is used, and hence, the same frequency channel is time-shared for downlink and uplink transmissions under the dynamic control of the base station. We divide traffic into two classes: class I (real-time) and II (non-real-time). Whenever there is no eligible class-I traffic, class-II traffic is transmitted, while uplink transmissions are controlled with a reservation scheme. Class-I traffic is handled with the framing strategy combined with the admission test for adding new class-I connections. Finally, we present the performance (average delay and throughput) evaluation of the reservation scheme for class-II traffic using both analytical calculations and simulations.},

abstract={A multipoint flow control framework for data traffic traversing both a wired and mobile wireless network is proposed. A Markov modulated fluid model is used for the receiver to capture the dynamics of the wireless links. We discover that the phase difference of the instantaneous throughput of the receivers is a distinctive feature of multicast connections. The objectives of the multicast flow control algorithms are to cope with the receiver phase difference cost-effectively in addition to the general goals such as maximizing throughput and minimizing delay. Three ad hoc algorithms have been studied: listen to slowest request (LSQ), source estimation (SE), and open loop control. A fluid analysis technique is applied to study the effect of receiver phase difference assuming zero delay. The effect of propagation delay is then discussed. Simulation results are presented to verify the analysis for the zero delay case and to compare the performance of the algorithms under non-negligible delay.},

abstract={This paper presents a shaper architecture that scales to a large number of connections with diverse burstiness and bandwidth parameters. The architecture arbitrates fairly between connections with conforming cells by carefully integrating leaky-bucket traffic shaping with rate-based scheduling algorithms. Through a careful combination of per-connection queueing and approximate sorting, the shaper performs a small, bounded number of operations in response to each arrival and departure, independent of the number of connections and cells. To handle a wider range of rate parameters, a hierarchical arbitration scheme can reduce the implementation overheads and the interference between competing connections. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the architecture limits shaping delay and traffic distortions, even under heavy congestion.},

abstract={Rate-function scheduling (RFS) is a new deadline-based packet-scheduling service discipline that supports quality-of-service guarantees for applications with real-time communication requirements. RFS is distinguished from other service disciplines in that it achieves all of the following goals: analytically-derived performance bounds, performance isolation among sessions, flexible and efficient allocation of bandwidth, implementation simplicity, work-conserving operation, and bandwidth-fair operation (defined in the paper). Through the specification of rate functions, sessions can control their bandwidth usage and their upper bounds on delay. For a class of rate functions, which we show is sufficient for providing sessions with delay bounds, RFS is as simple to implement and to calculate service bounds such as Zhang's VirtualClock service discipline. We also show that the non-preemptive earliest deadline first policy is a simple degeneration of RFS.},

abstract={The asymptotics of cell-loss ratio (CLR) in the regime of large buffers are characterized by two parameters, the asymptotic constant and asymptotic decay rate. Both parameters can be expanded in powers of one minus the link utilization (heavy traffic expansion). Thus, once the coefficients in this expansion are obtained, the CLR can be very easily estimated from the measured link utilization by using CLR asymptotics. This paper proposes an algorithm for estimating these coefficients in real time. For this purpose, the notion of state-space representation for a single-server queue is introduced: the elements of the state vector are the coefficients in the expansion of the asymptotic constant and asymptotic decay rate. Bayesian regression analysis is applied to estimate the state vector based on the buffer measurement. Our approach does not require any models describing the statistics of the traffic other than the asymptotic behavior of the CLR in the regime of large buffers. In addition, it allows us to estimate the effective bandwidth of the aggregated process easily, so it is applicable to a wide range of ATM traffic control methods, such as connection admission control and VP bandwidth control. We describe how this method of CLR estimation will be applied to connection admission control and VP bandwidth control by using results from simulation experiments.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a flooding method, called switch-aided flooding (SAF), for use in ATM networks. SAF-based protocols take advantage of hardware-supported cell relay and cell duplication, characteristic of such networks, in order to reduce the time needed to disseminate changes in network topology and resource availability. SAF protocols use a spanning multipoint connection (SMC), which is a hardware-switched network spanning tree, but revert to conventional link-by-link flooding when the spanning MC is unavailable or under construction. The results of a simulation study reveal that the proposed flooding protocols deliver network updates several times faster than conventional approaches, while using significantly less bandwidth.},

abstract={For ATM networks we derive the bounds formulas for the asymptotic tail distribution in a queue whose arrival process is a superposition of general periodic Markov sources. Note that we make no assumption for the structure of the general periodic Markov sources except that the underlying Markov chains are irreducible. The periodic source model in this paper is thus rather general. Taking initial state conditions of the periodic sources into account, we construct a superposed arrival process. Contrary to the previous works, this implies that the periodic sources are not independent. We also provide examples to investigate the efficiency and the accuracy of our bound formulas.},

pages={1096-1104 vol.3},
abstract={Traffic measurements from communication networks have shown that many quantities characterizing network performance have long-tail probability distributions, i.e., with tails that decay more slowly than exponentially. Long-tail distributions can have a dramatic effect upon performance, but it is often difficult to describe this effect in detail, because performance models with component long-tail distributions tend to be difficult to analyze. We address this problem by developing an algorithm for approximating a long-tail distribution by a finite mixture of exponentials. The fitting algorithm is recursive over time scales. At each stage, an exponential component is fit in the largest remaining time scale and then the fitted exponential component is subtracted from the distribution. Even though a mixture of exponentials has an exponential tail, it can match a long-tail distribution in the regions of primary interest when there are enough exponential components.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel algorithmic approach, the hybrid matrix geometric/invariant subspace method, for finding the stationary probability distribution of the finite quasi-birth-death (QBD) process which arises in performance analysis of computer and communication systems. Assuming that the QBD state space is defined in two dimensions with m phases and K+1 levels, the solution vector for level k, /spl pi//sub k/, 0/spl les/k/spl les/K is shown to be in a modified matrix geometric form /spl pi//sub k/=/spl upsi//sub 1/R/sub 1//sup k/+/spl upsi//sub 2/R/sub 2//sup K-k/ where R/sub 1/ and R/sub 2/ are certain solutions to two nonlinear matrix equations and /spl upsi//sub 1/ and /spl upsi//sub 2/ are vectors to be determined using the boundary conditions. We show that the matrix geometric factors R/sub 1/ and R/sub 2/ can simultaneously be obtained independently of K via finding the sign function of a real matrix by an iterative algorithm with quadratic convergence rates. The time complexity of obtaining the coefficient vectors /spl upsi//sub 1/ and /spl upsi//sub 2/ is shown to be O(m/sup 3/ log/sub 2/ K) which indicates that the contribution of the number of levels on the overall algorithm is minimal. Besides the numerical efficiency, the proposed method is numerically stable and in the limiting case of K/spl rarr//spl infin/, it is shown to yield the well-known matrix geometric solution /spl pi//sub k/=/spl pi//sub 0/R/sub 1//sup k/ for infinite QBD chain.},

abstract={In ATM networks, each node has its own buffer to store some cells. The buffer size represents a trade-off between cell loss and transmission delay, and therefore, it is of significant concern to evaluate the performance with respect to the buffer size. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of the loss probability with respect to the buffer size by considering a gradual input queue with a finite buffer. Gradual inputs are considered as those representing a bursty cell traffic. Applying the perturbation analysis technique to this model, we derive the strongly consistent sensitivity estimates, and combining with the likelihood ratio method, we confirm that our estimates lead to reasonable simulation results.},

abstract={Data copying can be a bottleneck in end-to-end communication over high-speed networks. Emulated copy is an alternative I/O data passing scheme that preserves the API and integrity guarantees of copying but avoids the latter using virtual memory manipulations - transient output copy-on-write (TCOW), input alignment, and page swapping. We characterize and evaluate the support necessary in network adapters for emulated copy in checksummed, multiple-packet communication. Our experiments on an ATM network show that: (1) emulated copy gives performance better than that of copying even without hardware checksumming support; (2) TCOW improves multiple-packet output performance without any hardware support or changes in applications; (3) page swapping provides additional similar improvements on multiple-packet input if there is input alignment, which requires either hardware support (early-demultiplexed/system-aligned buffering) or changes in applications (pooled/application-aligned buffering); and (4) The performance of application-aligned buffering is largely unaffected by header/data splitting, a common optimization. We propose a new optimization, buffer snap-off, that extends system-aligned buffering to the general case of arbitrary, unmatched data transfer and application input buffer lengths.},

abstract={Feedback flow control, in conjunction with limited buffering in the network, inevitably leads to packet loss. Effective congestion control requires not only effective flow control but also a good retransmission strategy. We present a new retransmission strategy called SMART that combines the best features of the traditional go-back-n and selective-retransmit strategies. We show, first, that go-back-n retransmission with static window flow control leads to congestion collapse when the nominal load exceeds the link capacity. Second, we can avert congestion collapse by replacing go-back-n with SMART retransmission, even with static window flow control. Third, SMART retransmission, when combined with packet-pair rate-based flow control, performs extremely well, both when losses are due to buffer overflows and when losses are random.},

We propose an intelligent monitoring system using adaptive statistical techniques. The system continually learns the normal behavior of the network and detects deviations from the norm. Within the monitoring system, the measurements are segmented, and features extracted from the segments are used to describe the normal behavior of the measurement variables. This information is combined in the structure of a Bayesian network. The proposed system is thereby able to detect unknown or unseen faults. Experimental results on real network data demonstrate that the proposed system can detect abnormal behavior before a fault actually occurs.},

abstract={An architectural design for high speed residential data access using the traditional IEEE 802.3 medium access protocol over the existing CATV network is proposed. The described architecture is attractive in using the existing infrastructure combined with the existing access scheme in the residential area and thus it is cost effective and well suited for home Internet access. However, the traditional CSMA/CD protocol is not suitable for the cable TV network due to its long propagation delay. Thus, we propose to combine the existing IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD MAC with the segmented cable subnetworks so that a home user can get access to the Internet as if he is using the Ethernet at 10 Mbps, or Fast-Ethernet at 100 Mbps. Only three subcarriers in the passband cable is used and therefore it will not interfere with the traditional broadcasting channels and the future digital video channels. The segmented cable are interconnected by the defined cable bridge (CB) and a simple flow control mechanism is proposed among the CBs. The functional components and operations of each CB are also described. For a fair performance among the subnetworks, a prioritized queueing scheme is also proposed on each CB.},

abstract={In order to span the NII (National Information Infrastructure) into the homes, the community cable TV networks have to be re-engineered to support two-way interactive services. We propose the PCUP (pipelined cyclic upstream protocol) as the upstream MAC (medium access control) protocol for HFC (hybrid fiber coax) community access network. The PCUP is designed with the intention of pipelining the upstream channel. This is achieved by proper station positioning, which measures the station propagation offset from the headend, and transmission scheduling, which assigns each station the transmission starting time and duration in a cycle. By taking into account the propagation offsets and the transmission times, the transmitted cells can appear back-to-back, ie. pipelined, at the headend. Since only the active stations are scheduled to transmit in a cycle, a membership control mechanism, which runs a contention-based tree walk algorithm, is executed periodically to allow the stations to join or leave. We also compare the PCUP with various schemes proposed to IEEE 802.14 committee.},

From the earlier research, it has been shown that the CSMA-type MLAN is superior to a single channel of equal network bandwidth. On the basis of the developed MLAN architecture, we construct a new network access protocol to provide multiple transmission priorities for various applications e.g., text, voice, video, image, etc. This protocol is called multiple-priority multichannel local area network (MP-MLAN). The data transmission of MP-MLAN is collision-free, and we can find the throughput characteristics of MP-MLAN are higher and more stable than the conventional CSMA/CD or multichannel CSMA/CD network from the analysis results. A queueing analysis model for representing the MP-MLAN protocol is established and simulation results are also provided to evaluate the performance of this network.},

abstract={The group allocation multiple access with collision detection (GAMA/CD) protocol for scheduling variable-length packet transmissions in a local area network is specified and analyzed. The GAMA/CD provides the advantages of both TDMA and CSMA/CD by maintaining a dynamically-sized cycle that varies in length depending on the network load; each cycle is composed of a contention period and a group-transmission period. During the contention period, a station with one or more packets to send competes for membership in the transmission group. Once a member of the transmission group, a station is able to send data without collision during each cycle; as long as a station has data to send, it maintains its position in the group. This can be viewed as either allowing stations to "share the floor" in an organized manner, or as establishing frames that are not synchronized on a slot-basis and vary their length dynamically based on demand. Both the throughput and the delay of GAMA/CD are presented and analyzed. To validate our analysis, the results of both models are compared to the throughput and delay produced by a simulation of GAMA/CD.},

abstract={Selective discarding policies, as a means for congestion avoidance, are studied and compared to non-discarding policies. The partial message discard policy discards the packets of the tails of corrupted messages. An improvement to this policy is the early message discard that drops entire messages and not just message-tails. A common performance measure of the network elements is the effective throughput which measures the utilization of the network links but which neglects the application altogether. We adopt a new performance measure, goodput, which reflects the utilization of the network from the application's point of view and thus better describes the network behavior. We develop and analyze a model for systems which employ discarding policies. The analysis shows a remarkable performance improvement when any message-based discarding policy is applied, and that the early message discard policy performs better, especially under high loads. We compute the optimal parameter setting for maximum goodput at different input loads and investigate the performance sensitivity to these parameters.},

pages={1199-1209 vol.3},
abstract={With the envisaged growth in Internet access services over networks with asymmetric links such as asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and hybrid fiber coax (HFC), it becomes crucial to evaluate the performance of window-based protocols over systems in which the reverse link is considerably slower than the forward link. Even if the actual bandwidth asymmetry is moderate, high effective asymmetries can result because of bidirectional traffic. Our objective is to determine, whether TCP/IP performs reasonably in a setting in which the reverse link is the primary bottleneck. Our main results are as follows. (1) For both the prevalent Tahoe version with Fast Retransmit and the Reno version of TCP we determine the throughput as a function of buffering, round-trip times and normalized asymmetry (taken to be the ratio of the transmission time of ACKs in the reverse path to that of data packets in the forward path). We identify three modes of operation which are dependent on the forward buffer sizes and the normalized asymmetry. (2) Asymmetry increases the TCP's already high sensitivity to random packet losses that might be caused by transient bursts in real-time traffic. Specifically, random loss leads to significant throughput deterioration when the product of the loss probability, the asymmetry and the square of the bandwidth delay product is large. (3) Congestion in the reverse path adds considerably to the TCP's unfairness when multiple connections share the reverse link. Link bandwidth sharing is unfair even for connections with identical round-trip times and hence use of per connection buffer allocation on the reverse path appears essential.},

abstract={Extensive simulation has demonstrated the effectiveness of credit-based ATM flow control in supporting client-server applications. In particular, request/response protocols used in these applications allow efficient sharing of switch buffer, for the case when all the VCs sharing the same buffer are subject to the same degree of downstream congestion. The required buffer size can be as small as the minimum of bandwidth/sup */RTT for the link and Clients/sup */Reply-Size. Request/response protocols generally tolerate congestion better than greedy loads. Being able to avoid synchronization, FIFO scheduling is sometimes more efficient than VC round-robin scheduling. These findings are derived from an online Web database of simulation results covering more than 10,000 network and load configurations. The Web database approach has proven to be effective in managing and navigating a large set of simulation results.},

abstract={We examine the performance of bidirectional TCP/IP connections over asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks using the available bit rate (ABR) service. The problem of "ack-compression" re-appears, although the queues are primarily at the end-systems. We further the understanding of the problem by quantitatively analyzing the periodic bursty behavior of the source IP queue. We are able to predict the peak values for the queue and arrive at a simple robust predictor for the degraded throughput, applicable for relatively general situations. The degradation in throughput due to bidirectional traffic can be significant. For example, even in the simple case of symmetrical connections with adequate window sizes, the throughput of each connection is only 66.67% of that under one-way traffic. We validate our analysis using simulation, where the ATM network uses the explicit rate option. We show that the analysis predicts the behavior of the queue and the throughput degradation. We observe the need to separate the flow of acknowledgments and data for the bidirectional TCP connection and for inter-leaving their processing at the end-systems to overcome the problem of ack compression.},

abstract={Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks are scalable via a wide variety of physical link speeds and can be run in both the local and wide areas. Bandwidth reservation and quality of service guarantees make ATM attractive to deliver multimedia information in real-time. Existing protocol suites can be extended. However, they do not give access to those characteristics. Therefore, applications demand an ATM application programming interface (API) to take advantage of those features. This paper covers a special syntax mapping of the ATM API services on top of X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) which is able to give applications access directly to the special quality and traffic services of an ATM network. A particular realization of the API on the XTI environment is proposed and implemented on the MacOS networking platform. It provides a flexible and modular design of the ATM networking. Finally, the paper concludes with one ATM-aware application (video on demand) which requires real-time streaming data.},

It is usual to design a protocol for each new service which is required. An attractive alternative is to use a modular and object-oriented architecture for the design and implementation of network protocols. With it, protocols for individual service provision can be created by simply combining generic protocol functions blocks.

abstract={The non-deterministic behavior in telecommunication services are well-known as one of the most typical feature interactions, and they should be detected and eliminated from the telecommunication service specifications. The conventional analysis method of this non-determinism is based on reachability analysis. Since the method must exhaustively enumerate all reachable global states, it cannot be applied to the complex communication services which include many users. We propose an alternative method based on a Petri-net model. The method constructs a logically equivalent Petri-net for a given service specification, and obtains a set of states which cause the non-deterministic behavior using rules in the service specification. Then, the method identifies states in the set which are not reachable from the initial state using the P-invariant of the Petri-net, and deletes them from the set. As the P-invariant is utilized as the necessary condition, we must finally apply reachability analysis to states in the resultant set. Since the number of states in the resultant set may be reduced to a relatively small value the new method enables us to analyze the more complex services.},

abstract={To complement the prior work of Kung-Ying Tyan, Chao-Ju Hou, Bin Wang and Ching-Chih Han (see Proc. IEEE 17th Real-Time Systems Symposium, Washington DC, 1996), we address the problem of dynamically establishing/terminating real-time message streams in response to call setup/clear requests in single-hop star-coupled WDMA-based optical networks. We consider a network architecture in which N stations are connected to a star coupler with W data channels (W/spl les/N) and one control channel. Each of the W data channels is slotted and shared by the N stations by means of time division multiplexing. The control channel is used for stations to coordinate the call establishment and termination operations. We propose a distributed, dynamic slot allocation scheme to allocate/deallocate, in response to call setup/clear requests, time slots on the W data channels to message streams, with the objective of meeting message deadlines. We formally prove the properties, and the correctness of, the proposed dynamic slot allocation scheme.},

abstract={We consider the problem of coordinating access to the various channels of a single-hop WDM network. We present HiPeR-l, a new reservation protocol specifically designed to overcome the potential inefficiencies of operating in environments with non-negligible processing, tuning, and propagation delays. HiPeR-l differs from previous reservation protocols in that each control packet makes reservations for all data packets waiting in a node's queues, thus significantly reducing the control overhead. Packets are scheduled for transmission using algorithms that can effectively mask the tuning times. HiPeR-l also uses pipelining to mask the processing times and propagation delays. We use Markov chain theory to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the protocol. The stability condition provides insight into the factors affecting the operation of the protocol, such as the degree of load balancing across the various channels, and the quality of the scheduling algorithms. The analysis is fairly general, as it holds for MMBP-like arrival processes with any number of states, and for non-uniform destinations.},

Several dynamic assignment algorithms are developed, and architectural issues in interconnecting optical networks are discussed.

abstract={We propose a flow-control scheme that combines the merits of credit- and rate-based flow-control schemes by applying direct control over both bandwidth and buffer resources. The goal of the proposed scheme is to design an optimal rate-control policy for a given finite buffer capacity that maximizes the average throughput and bounds the end-to-end delay. By applying higher-order rate control, the proposed scheme not only makes the rate process converge to the neighborhood of the link bandwidth, but also confines the queue-length fluctuation to a regime bounded by the buffer capacity (thus guaranteeing lossless transmission). Using the fluid approximation method, we model the proposed flow-control scheme and study the system dynamic behavior for ABR (available bit rate) service under the most stressful traffic condition. We derive the expressions for queue build-ups and average throughput in both transient and equilibrium states. The analytical results have shown the proposed scheme to be stable and efficient in that the source rate and bottleneck queue length rapidly converge to the designated operating region. Also presented, are examples showing that the proposed scheme outperforms the other existing schemes.},

abstract={Because the ATM Forum does not standardize the ABR flow control algorithm that an ATM switch should run, some ATM networks are likely to contain switches that run different ABR flow control algorithms. Even if all the switches within a "cloud" of switches use the same algorithm, individual clouds (each with it own algorithm) will be interconnected by virtual circuits. Virtual circuits which traverse multiple clouds will therefore be controlled by two different flow control algorithms concurrently. We explore some of the ramifications of mixing different flow control algorithms in the same ATM network. We identify the rate mismatch problem, which arises when a nonbottleneck switch (that uses one algorithm) interferes with the control of the bottleneck switch (that uses another algorithm). We formulate a hypothesis that states the conditions that lead to the rate mismatch problem. These conditions identify a specific class of problematic topologies. We validate the hypothesis formally and prove that rate mismatch causes unfairness. Using four different algorithms, in combinations of two at a time, we illustrate the interoperability of ABR flow control algorithms.},

abstract={An approximate queueing analysis of a distributed explicit rate allocation algorithm for the flow control of available bit rate (ABR) service, which captures the effect of bandwidth-delay, is described. Attention is focused on bounding the worst case transient queueing behaviour in a strictly-ABR environment with persistent start-up sources. At each switch, resource management (RM) cells are enqueued using a buffer separate from the data cells, and are served with a higher priority than data cells. Both single and multiple node network cases are treated for connections with differing delays. The approximate analysis shows relatively good agreement with simulation results for single node networks, but gives looser estimates for the multiple node case.},

abstract={A critical issue in the design of fast packet-switch-based networks is the avoidance of data loss due to congestion. In the context of ATM networks, many link-level congestion control mechanisms for ABR traffic have been proposed and simulated, and a few have been implemented. This paper presents, for the first time, an experimental comparison of several such mechanisms. To drive this comparison, we have developed a set of benchmarks that provide a quantitative characterization of congestion control performance. We also describe a simple but novel technique, the "virtual port card", for implementing both non-native switch behavior and long link delays in ATM networks. This technique allows us to compare a wide range of mechanisms on a single flexible hardware platform. Our measurements show that while several of the ATM flow control mechanisms can eliminate cell loss, there are still several unresolved problems. First, for some traffic scenarios we see very poor application-level performance, especially in the presence of bursty traffic. Second, the performance is very sensitive to the flow control parameters and identifying an appropriate set of parameters is difficult since it depends heavily on the traffic conditions.},

abstract={In typical video delivery systems offering programs on-demand, service should be be nearly immediate and continuous. A video server can provide this type of service by reserving sufficient network and server resources for the duration of playout. Scalability and reduced cost can be achieved using a single channel to serve multiple customers waiting for the same program (referred to as batching). Batching is especially useful during high load periods typically occuring during evening prime time hours. Typical channel allocation algorithms use a greedy, allocate-as-needed policy. Variations in system load can cause these algorithms to suffer poor and unpredictable short-term performance, and non-optimal long term performance. In this paper, we develop a set of realistic workloads, identify the limitations of greedy allocation algorithms, and propose a set of rate-based allocation schemes to solve these limitations. The performance of various video delivery systems are simulated and compared. The rate-based policies are shown to be robust for the workloads examined, and are easy to implement.},

pages={1341-1348 vol.3},
abstract={Video-on-demand (VOD) servers need to be efficiently designed in order to support a large number of users viewing the same or different videos at different rates. While considering a disk-array based VOD server, use of a shared buffer at the server end may be more economical than the sole use of dedicated buffers at each user's end. In this paper we propose a simple buffer sharing architecture that may be used when disk-array based video servers are used. Our aim is to support the maximum number of users for a given number of video server disks while employing a simple scheme requiring less buffer space. The number of video segment retrievals that can occur within a certain time (the service round) is maximum when the scan disk scheduling algorithm is used. Consequently, we shall assume use of the scan algorithm for disk retrieval. The VOD server has a buffer manager that directs retrieved segments to appropriate buffer locations depending on their release and deadlines. The release and deadlines of segments are such that buffer requirement at the user's set-top box is minimized to two video segments while avoiding video starvation and buffer overflow at the user's end. We propose a novel scheme for the operation of the shared buffer that aims at increasing buffer utilization and decreasing cell loss due to buffer overflow. An ATM based broadband network is assumed and all segments are stored in buffers as fixed length ATM cells.},

pages={1349-1356 vol.3},
abstract={A true video-on-demand (VOD) system provides the ultimate flexibility in video services by allowing users to select any video programs, at any time, and to perform any VCR-like user interactions. To allow true VOD, one approach is to have a dedicated video stream for each customer. This is expensive, especially when multiple identical video streams are sent to multiple customers accessing the same video. To be commercially viable, VOD service must be priced competitively with existing video rental services. Batching may be used to reduce this cost. It allows multiple users accessing the same video to share the same video stream. The batching approach, however, complicates the provision of user interactions. Existing batching schemes only allow near VOD services. This paper describes a new protocol, called split and merge (SAM), which offers true VOD services while allowing multiple users to share the same video stream. This sharing is transparent to the users and it appears as if each has a dedicated video stream. Our approach is to split an interactive user from the batch and to serve him with a dedicated video stream. We develop an innovative way to merge these individuals back to the batching streams when they resume normal play mode. The SAM protocol therefore significantly improves the system resource utilization and the number of simultaneous users, and more importantly, allows true VOD services.},

abstract={We present a technique, called bidirectional highly optimized pipelining (BiHOP), for managing disks as a buffer for the tertiary storage of a multimedia server. We implement a simulator to compare its performance to that of a recently proposed scheme called SEP. The results show that BiHOP performs significantly better. Its superior performance is attributed to a novel caching approach, which caches every other data fragment of the multimedia file, rather than caches consecutive fragments as in traditional practice. This new approach allows us to use tiny staging buffers for pipelining, which can be implemented in the memory to conserve disk bandwidth. Furthermore, the whole disk space can be dedicated for caching purposes to improve hit ratio. Another important advantage of BiHOP is its ability to pipeline in either forward or reverse direction with the same efficiency. This unique feature, not possible with existing schemes, makes it natural for implementing VCR functions.},

abstract={In order to minimize latency in high-speed interconnection networks, the wormhole routing technique can be employed. With this technique, a switch transmits an incoming message as soon as it receives it, without waiting for the entire message. The problem then is that a message stretches over several links and locks network resources, thus making a contention situation possible. Two principal congestion control mechanisms cast be considered, backpressure flow control and deflection routing. The performance of these mechanisms depends both on the traffic characteristics and on the network topology. In order to compare them, we study analytically the behavior of a wormhole routing network model with random input traffic under both policies. We estimate the probability of collision between messages and express the average message transit delay as a function of the offered load. Simulation provides a good confirmation for the analytical results. This study gives us an understanding of the behavior of the system under different resource management policies.},

abstract={Dynamic routing has been adopted in many circuit switched networks in many parts of the world. A number of dynamic routing schemes have been designed and studied with the aim of maximizing the network throughput. The least loaded routing (LLR) is simple and efficient, while other more elaborate routing schemes can only provide marginal throughput gain over that of LLR. Re-routing is the practice of routing calls on alternate paths to direct paths or other less congested alternate paths. It allows the continuous redistribution of network loads so that the congestion on direct paths can be relieved. We study a re-routing scheme based on LLR. An original analysis of re-routing is performed and numerical examples confirm the significant throughput gain over LLR routing.},

We discuss existing proposals for local and wide area IP multicasting and their implications for point-to-point links, identify problems with their integration in this environment, and propose alternative special purpose mechanisms to solve these problems. The main problems are overhead due to IGMP leave latency and unnecessary continuous probing of potentially power constrained hosts. Our solution is an alternative to IGMP mechanisms based on join/leave messages for tracking group membership over PtP networks.

abstract={One of the most attractive features of the virtual LAN (VLAN) is the capability to group users into broadcast domains, which are independent of their locations on the physical network. This paper deals with the VLAN services using ATM LAN emulation technology which operates on a client/server model. The focuses are on the issues of supporting transparent VLAN services and internetworking among VLANs for mobile stations. A mobile VLAN (MVLAN) architecture is proposed, perhaps for the first time, to efficiently maintain multiple VLAN broadcast domains over a single ATM network even when the VLANs contain mobile stations. The proposed solution (1) ensures that layer 2 frames between a mobile station and any station, either static or mobile, that belongs to the original registered VLAN can be exchanged transparently, (2) provides transparent communications between VLANs using the layer 2 bridging approach, and (3) handles excessive server-to-server traffic efficiently, including the broadcast/multicast frames. The proposed MVLAN architecture moves one step closer towards facilitating the mobility management in an ATM network while conforming to the emerging LAN emulation standard.},

abstract={We present a new distributed routing protocol for mobile, multihop, wireless networks. The protocol is one of a family of protocols which we term "link reversal" algorithms. The protocol's reaction is structured as a temporally-ordered sequence of diffusing computations; each computation consisting of a sequence of directed link reversals. The protocol is highly adaptive, efficient and scalable; being best-suited for use in large, dense, mobile networks. In these networks, the protocol's reaction to link failures typically involves only a localized "single pass" of the distributed algorithm. This capability is unique among protocols which are stable in the face of network partitions, and results in the protocol's high degree of adaptivity. This desirable behavior is achieved through the novel use of a "physical or logical clock" to establish the "temporal order" of topological change events which is used to structure (or order) the algorithm's reaction to topological changes. We refer to the protocol as the temporally-ordered routing algorithm (TORA).},

abstract={The EPRCA (enhanced proportional rate control algorithm) is a leading congestion control protocol for available bit rate (ABR) service in ATM networks. Even though EPRCA has been adopted by the ATM Forum as the standard for ABR congestion control, we show that this protocol is only marginally stable. The stability analysis presented in this paper does not consider interactions among network components and should be considered as a bottle-neck stability result. We show that, if a queue is the bottleneck of a congested path, then its queue size will eventually decrease. However, if a queue is not congested, its queue size can actually increase and the congestion can be self-induced.},

abstract={Most application-level data units are too large to be carried in a single packet (or cell) and must be segmented for network delivery. To an application, the end-to-end delays and loss rate of its data units are much more relevant performance measures than ones specified for individual packets (or cells). The concept of a burst (or block) was introduced to represent a sequence of packets (or cells) that carry an application data unit. In this paper, we describe how a real-time VBR service, with quality of service parameters for block transfer delay and block loss rate, can be provided by integrating concepts and delay guarantee results from our previous work on burst scheduling, together with ideas from ATM block transfer. Two new contributions are presented. First, we design an admission control algorithm to provide the following classes of service: bounded-delay block transfer with no loss, and bounded-delay block transfer at a specified block loss rate. Second, we show how to extend existing end-to-end delay bounds to networks with hierarchical link sharing.},

abstract={We present an analysis of an existing rate-based ABR scheduling algorithm described by Kline (see ATM-Forum Contribution 94-0849), and propose an enhanced rate-based round robin (RBR) scheduling algorithm for ATM switches and end systems. One of the novel aspects of RBR is that the scheduler supports available bit rate (ABR) traffic as well as guaranteed bandwidth reservations. In addition, bandwidth overbooking is allowed by the scheduler for ABR services to improve the link efficiency as recommended by most flow control schemes. Under competition, the scheduler distributes the bandwidth in a max-min fair way. Any unused reservations for guaranteed services are reallocated to ABR services. Finally, the operations performed during each scheduling cycle are constant, independent of the number of connections. Simulation results are also presented and analyzed.},

year={1997},

pages={406-418 vol.2},
abstract={Several algorithms have been proposed for the switch behavior for congestion control of available bit rate (ABR) services. Schemes such as the enhanced proportional rate control algorithm (EPRCA) and the dynamic max rate control algorithm (DMRCA), which use the queue length as the congestion indicator to make a simple approximation of the fair share converge to the actual fair share, have become popular, because they offer a good performance and are simple to implement. In particular, with no VBR traffic in the network, DMRCA has been shown to achieve fairness in all situations, good buffer control, and robust performance. First we show that the performance of these schemes may degrade when ABR traffic interacts with highly-bursty VBR traffic. If VBR traffic induces congestion in the network, the length of the ABR queue cannot serve as a reliable indicator of congestion caused by ABR traffic, and the schemes perform poorly, introducing considerable unfairness. Then, we propose a simple technique to solve these problems. The switch constructs the length of a virtual queue which is not affected by the instantaneous behavior of VBR traffic, and does not depend on how the two types of traffic are served in order to share the common link capacity; thus, it can serve as a reliable indicator of congestion. We use this technique in DMRCA with virtual queueing (DMRCA-VQ), and show that the new scheme achieves fair rate allocation to the ABR connections also in the presence of highly-bursty VBR traffic. The DMRCA-VQ maintains the low hardware complexity of DMRCA. The virtual queueing technique is a solution for the more general problem of separating rate allocation based on the queue length from scheduling of multiple queues for sharing a common resource.},

abstract={We suggest the M|G|/spl infin/ input process as a viable model for network traffic due to its versatility and tractability. We characterize the process as short- or long-range dependent by means of a simple test. To gauge its performance, we study the large buffer asymptotics of a multiplexer driven by an M|G|/spl infin/ input process. The decay rate of the tail probabilities for the buffer content (in steady-state) is investigated using large deviations techniques suggested by Duffield and O'Connell (see Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, no.118, p.363-74, 1995). We show that the selection of the appropriate large deviations scaling is related to the forward recurrence time of the service time distribution, and a closed-form expression is derived for the corresponding generalized limiting log-moment generating function associated with the input process. We apply our results to cases where the service time distribution in the M|G|/spl infin/ input model is (i) Rayleigh, (ii) gamma, (iii) geometric, (iv) Weibull, (v) log-normal and (vi) Pareto-cases (v) and (vi) have been found adequate for modeling packet traffic streams in certain networking applications. Finally, we comment on the insufficiency of the short- vs. long-range dependence characterization of an input process as a means to accurately describe the corresponding buffer dynamics.},

pages={427-435 vol.2},
abstract={In high-speed networks based on asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), variable bit rate (VBR) sources generate bursty cell streams which share the link bandwidth wherever multiplexing occurs. In theory, the bandwidth requirement per stream to support a given quality-of-service at a multiplexer should generally decrease as the number of streams increases. In practice, high statistical multiplexing gain is difficult to achieve because good traffic characterizations are usually not available. This paper proposes the use of peakedness-based measures to capture the statistical information from traffic streams needed to determine bandwidth allocations. The standard definition of peakedness applies only to point process models of traffic. Yet fluid models of traffic have certain advantages in terms of tractability. Hence, we introduce a new measure called modified peakedness, which encompasses point process and fluid models under a common framework. We develop some of its properties and specialize it to several common traffic models. Finally, we study the effectiveness of the peakedness/modified peakedness as burstiness measures for real-time traffic.},

abstract={We develop a filtering theory for deterministic traffic regulators that generate f-constrained outputs. We show that such regulators can be implemented by a linear time invariant filter with the impulse response f under the (min,+)-algebra if the function f is increasing and subadditive. The filtering approach not only yields easier proofs for more general results than those in the literature, but also allows us to design traffic regulators via systematic methods such as concatenation, filter bank summation, linear system realization, and FIR-IIR realization. The theory has many applications, including leaky buckets, traffic regulation for periodic constraint functions, and service curves. In particular, we find a new linear system realization and a new FIR-IIR realization for a concatenation of leaky buckets. Moreover, we find an FIR-IIR realization for traffic regulators with periodic constraint functions. We also show that such regulators, in conjunction with maximum delay guarantee, guarantee shifted-subadditive service curves. Based on this, we provide a couple of rules for service curve allocation among a concatenation of servers.},

abstract={This paper develops a framework of traffic shaping which has the goal of increasing the nodal connection-carrying capacity. The shaping filters are designed to interwork with statistical multiplexers which use FIFO buffers. Differences in delay tolerances between traffic classes are exploited to shape and smooth the less delay sensitive traffic. The source model used in the analysis is asynchronous, worst-case subject to dual leaky bucket regulation, where the asynchrony is due to the assumption of independent sources. This, together with the allowance of small loss probabilities, makes statistical multiplexing feasible. We require the shapers to be lossless so that losses, if any, occur only at the multiplexer. We obtain the optimal design of the shaper such that a given delay tolerance for the connection is satisfied. For purposes of admission control we obtain the admissible region of combinations of sources of various types such that the QoS requirements in loss and delay are satisfied. By examining the regions obtained with and without shaping we quantify the capacity gain from shaping. Our numerical results show that the gain can be substantial.},

abstract={The bulk multicast transport protocol (BMTP) offers rate controlled multicast with reliability, high throughput, and support for large numbers of receivers. A multicast sender needs feedback from receivers to recover from errors and to choose an appropriate send rate, but must avoid being overwhelmed as the number of receivers grows. The BMTP does this by keeping the rate at which each receiver sends feedback inversely proportional to a running estimate of the number of receivers. The BMTP bases its send rate on the minimum of the receive rates observed by the receivers, causing the sender to slow down in the face of packet loss or competing traffic, and to speed up when there is spare network capacity. The BMTP's NAK-based retransmission rarely sends any data more than twice, a substantial improvement over iterated unicast. Rabin's (1989) information dispersal algorithm can reduce this re-send rate as close as desired to the underlying loss rate of the network. Simulations with 1000 receivers substantiate these claims.},

abstract={For a reliable, feedback dependent multicast transport protocol to scale, it must avoid the feedback implosion problem, particularly if the protocol targets arbitrarily large multicast groups communicating over lossy networks. Most existing suppression based feedback control mechanisms address the implosion problem using timers based on round-trip time (RTT) estimates between each receiver and the source. The algorithm presented has three major benefits: it does not need to compute the RTT from all receivers to the source, does not require knowledge of group membership, and provides prompt feedback. A small set of representative receivers and probabilistic suppression are used to limit feedback. We believe that this approach will perform well in real networks. Simulations show that for various multicast group sizes, a few representatives can keep the amount of feedback low while not degrading feedback timeliness.},

abstract={Our aim is to investigate reliable transmission for multicast communication and explore its relationship to multicast routing. We derive two characterizations that enable the comparison of routing algorithms and error recovery mechanisms with respect to the multicast tree topology, namely the probability mass function of successful receptions and the expected number of retransmissions needed to deliver a packet from the source to all receivers. We also give a tight approximation of the computationally expensive expected number of retransmissions. These expressions allow to explore the relationship between routing and error recovery for multicast communication. We finally evaluate the impact of routing algorithms on the performance of reliable multicast transmission and give a realistic generic model for a multicast tree.},

abstract={A growing number of network applications require the use of a reliable multicast protocol to disseminate data from a source to a potentially large number of receivers. This paper presents an analytic performance analysis of the packet delay incurred under three generic sender- and receiver-initiated approaches towards reliable multicast. We focus on the host processing requirements of these protocols and derive expressions for average time between the initial arrival of a packet at a sender and its correct reception at a randomly chosen receiver. Our numerical results indicate that a NAK-based protocol that limits NAK generation by intentionally and randomly delaying NAK packets can achieve substantially higher throughput than the other two protocols examined and can do so without suffering an appreciable higher delay over a range of system parameters.},

abstract={This paper proposes optical wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks with limited wavelength conversion that can efficiently support lightpaths (connections) between nodes. Each lightpath follows a route in the network and must be assigned a channel along each link in its route. The load /spl lambda//sub max/ of a set of lightpath requests is the maximum over all links of the number of lightpaths that use the link. At least /spl lambda//sub max/ wavelengths will be needed to assign channels to the lightpaths. If the network has full wavelength conversion capabilities then /spl lambda//sub max/ wavelengths are sufficient to perform the channel assignment. We propose ring networks with a fixed wavelength conversion capability within the nodes that can support all lightpath request sets with load /spl lambda//sub max/ at most W-1, where W is the number of wavelengths in each link. We also propose ring networks with selective pairwise wavelength conversion capability within the nodes that can support all lightpath request sets with load /spl lambda//sub max/ at most W. We also propose a star network with fixed wavelength conversion capability at its hub node that can support all lightpath request sets with load /spl lambda//sub max/ at most W. We extend this result to tree networks and networks with arbitrary topologies. These results show that significant improvements in traffic-carrying capacity can be obtained in WDM network by providing a very limited wavelength conversion capability within the network.},

abstract={We study routing methods in all-optical switching networks. In all-optical switching networks, the connection with more hops encounters more call blocking, and it is especially true in optical networks with no wavelength conversions. We therefore consider an alternate routing method with limited trunk reservation in which connections with more hops are prepared more alternate routes. Through developing an approximate analytic approach, we show that our method keeps good performance when compared with the existing alternate routing methods, and also that the fairness among connections can be improved. Further performance improvement is investigated by introducing a wavelength assignment policy and a dynamic routing method. An effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated through simulation.},

pages={533-540 vol.2},
abstract={In this paper we introduce a new approach to ATM switching. We propose an ATM switch architecture which: uses only a single shift-register-type buffering element to store and queue the cells; and within the same physical queue switches the cells by organizing them in logical queues destined to different output lines. The buffer is also a sequencer which allows flexible ordering the cells in each logical queue to achieve any appropriate scheduling algorithm. This switch is proposed for use as the building block of large-scale multi-stage ATM switches and as the scheduler/controller for the RAM-based switches. The single queue switch implements output queueing and performs full buffer sharing. The hardware complexity is low. The number of input and output lines can vary independently without affecting the switch core. The size of the buffering space can be increased by simply cascading the buffering elements to each other.},

pages={541-548 vol.2},
abstract={Current high-speed packet switching systems, ATM in particular, have large port buffering requirements. The use of highly integrated ASIC technology for implementing high-degree and high-speed switch fabrics is facing a technology mismatch in the sense that today's chip technology does not allow to integrate on-chip the high-speed switching fabric with the large buffering requirements. Consequently, many designs are based on the principles of queueing displacement, i.e., they attempt to move the queueing point off-chip. This is usually done by considerably speeding-up the on-chip switch output ports and placing a second external stage of buffering between the switch fabric and the outgoing link circuitry. Such designs are very popular and are used by many current ATM switch vendors. While such schemes are widely used, no rigourous analysis has so far been offered to evaluate the design trade-offs and to quantify the design points. The model we use to analyze the performance of the above system is a two-node tandem queueing system. The first node in the tandem corresponds to the internal buffer while the second node in the tandem corresponds to the external buffer. It is assumed that the internal buffer is able to transfer c/sub 1/ cells per time unit to the external buffer, while the external buffer is served at a lower rate of c/sub 2/ cells per time unit.},

The approach is quite general and not limited by a Markovian framework. We apply our analytical method to study the buffer behavior for various traffic sources such as multiplexed homogeneous and heterogeneous Markov modulated sources, sources that are correlated at multiple time scales, sources whose autocorrelation function exhibits heavy (sub-exponential) tail behavior, and sources generated from real MPEG-encoded video sequences.},

QLWFQ has upward compatibility with fair queueing and FIFO, and can be considered to be a simplified version of weighted round robin. A delay bound and a fairness index are derived analytically for the QLWFQ algorithm. The simulation results for heavily and lightly loaded conditions are also presented.

abstract={A packet scheduler in a quality-of-service (QoS) network should be sophisticated enough to support stringent QoS constraints at high loads, but it must also have a simple implementation so that packets can be processed at the speed of the transmission link. The earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduler is the optimal scheduler for bounded-delay services in the sense that it provides the tightest delay guarantees of any scheduler, but an implementation of EDF requires the sorting of packets, a complex operation that is not practical for high-speed networks. In this study we present the design, implementation and analysis of the novel rotating-priority-queues/sup +/ (RPQ/sup +/) scheduler that is near-optimal in the sense that it can approximate EDF with arbitrary precision. The RPQ/sup +/ scheduler uses a set of prioritized FIFO queues whose priorities are rearranged (rotated) periodically to increase the priority of waiting packets. We derive admission control tests for RPQ/sup +/ and show that it has the following desirable properties: its implementation requires operations independent of the number of queued packets, it can provide worst-case delay guarantees, and its efficiency is "between" that of EDF and static-priority (SP) schedulers. We use numerical examples, including examples based on MPEG video, to show that in realistic scenarios RPQ/sup +/ can closely approximate EDF even for infrequent queue rotations.},

abstract={Several researchers have suggested employing two-stage entry monitors for high-speed networks; the first stage enforcing a long term rate, the second stage enforcing a peak rate over a shorter time scale. In spite of this interest, little work on analyzing such systems has appeared. Not only is the analysis hard because of the the correlation between the stages, but for the most popular policing scheme, the leaky bucket, prior work is not easily generalized to two stages. This paper presents a performance analysis of a two-stage entry monitor, by analyzing the combined queue length of a two-stage system. Our analysis is for a two-stage buffered moving window. Analyzing such a conservative scheme enables us to bound the penalty of more optimistic schemes, in particular a two stage leaky bucket based system. We obtain a closed form analytical result, and show how to evaluate it for a wide range of parameters of interest. Our results show that the performance penalty of having the second stage is minimal under reasonable rate assumptions.},

abstract={Resource reservation in advance (ReRA) enables scheduling and allocation of resources at an early stage in time. This way, the availability of resources can actually be guaranteed for the point in time when the resources are needed. As opposed to that, current reservation protocols such as RSVP perform an "immediate" reservation without advance scheduling. They can therefore suffer shortage of resources with subsequent rejection of applications. This paper describes our new approach for providing resource reservation in advance in ATM networks. As a foundation, we first present experiences of IPng and RSVP over ATM. Based on this work, we then discuss major design issues of an appropriate ReRA solution. Important aspects are the signalling model for ReRA, the admission control strategy, the duration of connections, and various other time-related parameters. We also discuss our ongoing implementation of ReRA as an extension of RSVP and outline directions for future research in this area.},

In this paper, the performance of NFS over various sizes of WAN is studied The effects of ATM flow-control and queueing strategies on NFS are discussed, as are the performance of TCP and UDP as NFS transport protocols. The primary conclusion is that standard NFS over UDP works well over ATM WANs as long as ATM-level flow control keeps the cell loss rate under one percent. In some cases, NFS over TCP works badly with small packets due to unfortunate interactions with TCP's congestion window.},

abstract={The combination of macrocells and microcells in a two-tier cellular system is attractive because it provides a balance between maximizing the number of users per unit area and minimizing the network control associated with handoff. In this paper we study system capacity of a two-tier cellular architecture employing 3 TDMA/CDMA strategies. Both the uplink and downlink are evaluated via mathematical analysis. It shows that system performance degrades for larger macrocells or microcells and the capacities are poor for users near the macrocells' boundary. It also shows a huge discrepancy between the results obtained for the center cell versus those obtained for the boundary cell.},

abstract={For wireless networks, time division multiple access (TDMA) offers certain well-known advantages over methods such as spread spectrum code division (CDMA). Foremost among them is the guarantee that other users will not interfere during a node's dedicated time slots. For this desirable isolation, the cost is synchronization. Viewing arbitrary time intervals as potential TDMA time slots, we ask whether it is possible to obtain some of the benefit of time division without incurring the synchronization cost. In particular, we address the question of whether a TDMA-like state can be induced on asynchronous channels in such a way as to reduce interference and energy consumption. Through analysis and simulation we find conditions under which it is desirable to use time division. We then show how autonomous power management may be used as a mechanism to induce a form of time division. In this context a backlog-sensitive power management system is presented.},

year={1997},
volume={2},
number={},
pages={649-657 vol.2},
abstract={For multirate wireless ATM traffic, the first part of the call admission process is to determine whether to admit calls as long as bandwidth is available or to deny admission to a call of a particular class even if there is enough bandwidth available, in the hope of admitting calls of some other class later. A second part of the process is to determine if the quality of service requested by the call can be met. A scenario in which the first part is particularly important is when the blocking probability requirements for different classes are different. We consider four policies to determine the circumstances under which calls of different types are admissible. For each of these policies, we show how to compute the blocking probabilities. For three of these policies, the blocking probabilities can be found by using results from product form networks. For the fourth, we provide an approximation which works extremely well in practice. We also formulate a non-linear programming problem which attempts to determine the parameters of the admissibility policies in such a way to maximize the call arrival rates while keeping the blocking probabilities under specified bounds. We provide an algorithm for solving the non-linear programming problem and use this as a basis for comparing the policies. We show that under some circumstances, it is possible to improve the system throughput by as much as 35% by a suitable use of the admissibility policies. This improvement in throughput is particularly important in wireless ATM networks, supporting high rate multimedia traffic because of the inherent limitations in bandwidth availability.},

abstract={We consider a communication network that offers multi-class services to multiple types of traffic. Users choose service classes so as to optimize their own performance. The network associates with each traffic type a nominal service class. Optimal prices should provide incentives for the users to assign each traffic type to its nominal service class. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal prices and provide an algorithm for their computation. We indicate that optimal prices can tolerate fluctuations in the various parameters. We then devise a distributed algorithm, with which the network can compute optimal prices even when it does not have sufficient knowledge on the traffic characteristics. Next, we consider an extended model which explicitly includes congestion effects. A key factor which emerges here is the amount of traffic at the disposal of each user. We consider the typical cases of individual, social and type optimization, for which we generalize our results.},

abstract={We propose charging schemes for ATM networks based on the concept of virtual effective bandwidths (VEB). The VEBs were initially developed by the authors to support real-time connection admission control (CAC) in a framework where traffic sources with different quality of service (QoS) requirements are multiplexed into the same finite length queue. The VEBs allow different QoS requirements to be related which is important for charging purposes. We propose three charging schemes which can be included in real-time CAC: the first one depends solely on the resource requirements of the call; the second is dependent on resource as well as QoS requirements of the call; and the third is dependent on the current traffic intensity of the other connections also.},

pages={675-682 vol.2},
abstract={In this paper we study the problem of resource allocation and control for an ATM node with regulated traffic. Both guaranteed lossless service and statistical service with small loss probability are considered. We investigate the relationship between source characteristics and the buffer/bandwidth trade-off under both services. Our contributions are the following. For guaranteed lossless service, we find that the optimal resource allocation scheme suggests a time scale separation of sources sharing an ATM node with finite bandwidth and buffer space, and the optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off is determined by the sources' time scale. For statistical service with a small loss probability, we present a new approach for estimating the loss probability in a shared buffer multiplexor with the so called "extremal" on-off periodic sources. Under this approach, the optimal resource allocation for statistical service is achieved by maximizing both the benefits of buffering sharing and bandwidth sharing. The optimal buffer/bandwidth trade-off is again determined by time scale separation.},

abstract={This paper shows how to provide an adaptive real-time group multicast (many-to-many) communication service. Such a service can be used by applications, like audio/video tele-conferencing, that require low loss, and bounded delay and jitter. In order to meet deterministic quality of service (QoS) requirements of a real-time group multicast, some communication resources are reserved. In this work we show (i) how bandwidth is reserved for each group, and (ii) how an active user in a multicast group can dynamically share, in an efficient and fair manner, the bandwidth allocated to its group. Quality of service support for a real-time multicast group is based on time driven priority. In this scheme the time is divided into time frames of fixed duration and all the time frames are aligned by using a global time reference which can be obtained from GPS (global positioning system). Bandwidth is allocated to a multicast group as a whole, rather than individually to each user. The allocation is done by reserving time intervals within time frames in some periodic fashion. This sort of allocation raises two problems that are studied in this paper: (1) scheduling: how time intervals are reserved to each multicast group, and (2) adaptive sharing: how the participants dynamically share the time intervals that have been reserved for their multicast group. The proposed approach is based on embedding multiple virtual rings, one for each multicast group. By using the virtual rings it is simple to route messages to all the participants, while minimizing the bound on the buffer sizes and queuing delays.},

We achieve group synchronization by adjusting the output timing of the master media stream at each slave destination to that at the master destination.

This diversity restricts the interoperability among QOS-aware multimedia applications written for different networks. We present an approach for managing multiparty, multimedia sessions in a heterogeneous internetwork spanning multiple signaling domains. Participants utilize the native signaling on their respective domains and interact with participants on other domains through signaling gateways that bridge the domains and provide translation of signaling procedures and QOS semantics. Data streams are transmitted using a hierarchical representation, which allows participants to independently adjust the reception quality of each stream according to their resources and interests. We present a particular design and implementation details for connecting ATM and IP signaling domains and conclude with its extension to an arbitrary number of interconnected domains.},

We present the design criteria, specification, and step-by-step construction of authentication and key distribution services based on experience in the KryptoKnight project. The central goal of the KryptoKnight project was the construction of basic network security functions in a minimal, flexible (thus, versatile) and scalable manner. Protocol minimality (in terms of resource usage) and flexibility are not merely theoretical goals; they have clear advantages in environments where computational resources are limited and connectivity is restricted. KryptoKnight was aimed at such environments: small and anemic wireless devices, simple network and data-link entities, embedded micro-devices and other special-purpose communication equipment and configurations. Furthermore, scalability of protocols makes their deployment possible in the presence of rapid network growth and inter-domain communication.},

A solution to the collusion problem is a method with which the colluders can uncover the hidden information. Communications protocols that employ cryptographic techniques are increasingly used to protect privacy as well as to communicate. A cryptographic protocol defines a process by which information is transferred among some users while hidden from others.

Several MAC protocols were recently proposed in order to resolve contentions among nodes sharing the available wavelengths in WDM rings. These MAC protocols achieve high efficiency but unsatisfactory fairness, due to the asymmetric position of sources with respect to destinations. Thus, in order to improve fairness, it is necessary to adopt a fairness control scheme. We discuss the adaptation of the MetaRing fairness control scheme to the context of WDM multi-channel rings. Several alternatives are considered and compared via simulation.},

abstract={The paper describes SR/sup 3/ (synchronous round robin with reservations) a collision-free medium access control protocol for all-optical slotted packet networks based on WDM multi-channel ring topologies where the nodes are equipped with one fixed-wavelength receiver and one wavelength-tunable transmitter. SR/sup 3/ is derived from the SRR and MMR protocols previously proposed by the authors for the same class of all-optical networks. SRR and MMR already achieve an efficient exploitation of the available bandwidth, while guaranteeing a throughput-fair access to each node. SR/sup 3/, in addition, allows the nodes to reserve slots, thereby achieving a stronger control on access delays; it is thus well suited to meet tight delay requirements, as is the case for multimedia applications. Simulation results show that SR/sup 3/ provides very good performance to guaranteed quality traffic, but also brings significant performance improvements for best-effort traffic.},

pages={769-776 vol.2},
abstract={Photonic slot routing (PSR) is a promising approach to solving the fundamental scalability problem of all-optical packet switched WDM networks. In this approach adjacent subnetworks can exchange wavelength sensitive traffic through bridges using wavelength non-selective devices which can be constructed using proven technologies. With photonic slot routing, packets sharing a common subnetwork destination are aggregated to form a photonic slot which is individually routed in order to reach the destination subnetwork. Photonic slots from different subnetworks can originate contentions at the bridge, leading to potential penalties of slot loss and retransmission. This paper shows how slot contention penalties can be reduced through the use of switched delay lines (SDL) at the bridges. The combination of these two innovative techniques, the photonic slot routing and the switched delay lines, leads to a unique solution that is shown to nearly achieve throughput and delay performance obtainable in absence of slot contentions.},

abstract={We propose STWnet, a self-routing high bandwidth optical network architecture for interconnecting users, grouped together as g groups with w users per group. STWnet uses the three dimensions of space, time, and wavelength by combining the advantages of space and temporal switching with the benefits of wavelength parallel data transmissions. Technologically difficult switching of individual wavelengths is avoided by prearranging transmissions in a way that they can be switched in a wavelength insensitive manner. Wavelengths are reused within the network thus allowing for a larger switching fabric. The proposed architecture can be internally expanded either in the spatial or temporal dimension to allow for multiple packets to be delivered to the same destination group. The expansion factor is determined based on the group knockout principle and given typical traffic patterns is a small number. STWnet allows easy group to group multicasting and broadcasting while system-wide multicasts and broadcasts can be achieved through repetitive group-to-group transmissions. The network uses readily available components such as opto-electronic directional couplers, fixed wavelength transmitters, and diffraction based parallel receivers while avoiding the use of relatively slow and expensive tunable components.},

pages={785-794 vol.2},
abstract={We study both the correctness and performance of the source/destination protocol of the available bit rate (ABR) service in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. Although the basic source/destination protocol for congestion management is relatively simple, the protocol specification has to cope with several "real-world" cases such as failures and delayed/lost feedback which may introduce complexity. Rigorous proofs of the correct functioning of the protocol based on a formal specification is necessary. We use a formal extended finite state machine (EFSM) model to show that the ABR source/destination protocol is free of live-locks, so that under all conditions both resource management (RM) and data cells will be transmitted. We also show that the network options of explicit forward congestion indication (EFCI) and explicit rate (ER) interoperate correctly. We use the understanding of the informal English description of the source/destination behavior and of our EFSM model to derive conditions that ensure that the source transmission rate is stable in the presence of delayed or lost feedback RM cells, especially under the operation of a source rule that requires the reduction of the source rate under these conditions. We arrive at bounds on the number of consecutive RM cell losses tolerated while the rate remains stable. We also provide a worst-case analysis of the delay in turning around RM cells at the destination station and the worst-case inter-departure time of forward RM cells from the source.},

abstract={Closed-loop input rate regulation schemes have come to play an important role in the transport of the available bit rate (ABR) traffic service category for ATM. We present a numerical approach to the performance study of a delayed feedback system with one congested node and multiple connections. This approach consists in modeling the feedback system as a finite quasi-birth-death (QBD) process. Due to the peculiar block tri-diagonal nature of its generator, efficient techniques exist for its steady-state and transient solutions. Using these techniques, we examine a simple parsimonious feedback system for issues such as throughput/loss performance, fairness and stability. Our approach has the flexibility to study the effect of several additional factors such as asynchronous feedback, two-level control and explicit rate notification in the presence of underlying high-priority traffic. This study brings to light the trade-offs between system performance and the complexity of the feedback scheme. Our study shows that the time scales of correlation of the feedback system have a dominant effect on its performance. These time scales are associated with the feedback delay, the durations of active/idle periods of traffic sources and the time scales of the underlying high-priority traffic. We also examine the effect of the time scales on the convergence time for the transient queueing system.},

abstract={We propose an explicit-rate ABR feedback control scheme, UT (uniform tracking). The distinct feature of UT is that it achieves max-min fairness by tracking an effective number of sources; specific constraint information is not required. As a result, its implementation is much simpler than that of other fair control schemes; indeed, its complexity is similar to that of unfair explicit-rate controls. In the thorough simulation study, UT demonstrates its ability to scale with speed, distance, number of users (both persistent and bursty), and number of switches while remaining robust, efficient, and fair under stressing conditions with MPEG background traffic and multiple propagation delay loops.},

pages={815-822 vol.2},
abstract={One of the main features of ABR services is the employment of a rate-based flow control mechanism. Feedback from the network switches to the end systems gives users the information necessary to adjust their transmission rates appropriately according to the current network load. This type of control has been investigated to some extent, assuming a constant transmission capacity on a bottleneck link. In this paper we develop a discrete-time analysis to study the effect of bottleneck service rate variations on the performance of the ABR flow control mechanism. Looking at real systems, such variations occur on the one hand due to the establishment and release of ATM connections and on the other hand due to the varying bandwidth demand of VBR connections. To model the rate variations, the bottleneck service rate is assumed to follow a general probability density function.},

abstract={We are building a high performance 1.2 Gb/s ATM network interface chip called the APIC (ATM Port Interconnect Controller). In addition to borrowing useful ideas from a number of research and commercial prototypes, the APIC design embraces several innovative features, and integrates all of these pieces into a coherent whole. Some of the novel ideas incorporated in the APIC design include: protected DMA and protected I/O, which allow applications to queue data for transmission or reception directly from user-space, effectively bypassing the kernel. This argues for moving the entire protocol stack including the interface device driver into the user-space, thereby yielding better latency and throughput performance than kernel-resident implementations. Pool DMA when used with packet splitting, is a technique that can be used to build true zero-copy kernel-resident protocol stack implementations, using a page-remapping technique. Finally, orchestrated interrupts and interrupt demultiplexing are mechanisms used to reduce the frequency of interrupts issued by the APIC. Although many of these ideas have been developed in the context of an ATM network interface, we believe they are also applicable in other contexts. In particular, protected DMA and I/O are promising techniques for improving the performance of several different types of I/O devices.},

abstract={In earlier papers, we proposed the PCC (parallel connection control) algorithm for the setup and release of on-demand ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) connections. This paper describes an implementation and analysis of PCC. The PCC algorithm is implemented on a testbed of three types of ATM switches from which service time measurements (software execution times) are obtained. These measured service times are used as input data for an analytical queueing network model to characterize the PCC end-to-end setup delay and maximum throughputs. Assuming all connections pass through ten switches, for this measured data, PCC has a theoretical maximum throughput of 343 calls/sec/switch, and at about 90% of this maximum limit (i.e., at 310 calls/sec/switch), the mean end-to-end connection setup delay is only 43 ms. We also compare PCC performance against an equivalent sequential connection setup/release approach. We observe that PCC end-to-end setup delay is much smaller than the sequential setup delay (34% at low load and even smaller at higher load). Also, the per-switch maximum throughput of the PCC approach is 80% more compared to the sequential approach.},

abstract={The Internet routing fabric is partitioned into several domains. Each domain represents a region of the fabric administered by a single commercial entity. Over the past two years, the routing fabric has experienced significant growth. From more than a year's worth of inter-domain routing traces, we analyze the Internet inter-domain topology, its route stability behavior, and the effect of growth on these characteristics. Our analysis reveals several interesting results. Despite growth, the degree distribution and the diameter of the inter-domain topology have remained relatively unchanged. Furthermore, there exists a four-level hierarchy of Internet domains classified by degree. However, connectivity between domains is significantly non-hierarchical. Despite increased connectivity at higher levels in the topology, the distribution of paths to prefixes from the backbone remained relatively unchanged. There is evidence that both route availability and the mean reachability duration have degraded with Internet growth.},

abstract={Today it is evident that ATM technology will have its role in the future of internetworking. Two major Internet backbone service providers, Sprint and MCI, have marketed their investments in ATM as a way to push more bandwidth into their Internet infrastructures. Regardless of whether ATM technology will thrive in the WAN or LAN, it is also evident that the Internet Protocol (IP), which has been the glue of the Internet allowing it to endure exponential growth, must be well supported over ATM. IP multicast (protocol extensions to IP that allow IP packets from one source to be distributed to multiple destinations) is an essential part of IP which has allowed multimedia applications, for example, to more efficiently use Internet resources. In this paper we describe an implementation of one model of supporting IP multicast over ATM, the Multicast over ATM model developed by the IETF (Armitage, 1996). We discuss empirical measurements gathered in a testbed with both a WAN and a LAN component that give insights into the behavior of this model. We detail some of the shortcomings of this model and discuss potential modifications to improve it. Ideas for other approaches to IP multicast over ATM are also described.},

abstract={This paper proposes a multipoint-to-multipoint multicast architecture for ATM networks. The necessity for such an architecture stems from the scalability requirements, both in terms of state to be maintained in the network and in terms of the group population dynamics, of a wide range of networking applications. We argue that approaches of using multicast servers or meshes of point-to-multipoint virtual circuits (VCs) may be inadequate solutions to this problem. We propose a true multipoint-to-multipoint architecture called SEAM, which uses a single VC for a multicast group consisting of multiple senders and receivers. We achieve this without changes to ATM's AAL5. SEAM relies on an additional switching feature we call cut-through forwarding, which enables the mapping of several incoming VCs into outgoing VCs. We believe that SEAM is both an important and necessary step in the evolution of ATM. It will enable applications relying on group multicast to benefit directly from ATM's quality of service support and scalable bandwidth and the resulting performance advantages. Also, it considerably simplifies the problem of supporting IP multicast over large ATM networks.},

abstract={The paper addresses the issue of minimizing the number of nodes involved in the routing over a multicast tree and in the maintenance of such a tree in a datagram network. It presents a scheme where the tree routing and maintenance burden is laid only upon the source node and the destination nodes associated with the multicast tree. The main concepts behind this scheme is to view each multicast tree as a collection of unicast paths, and to locate only the multicast source and destination nodes on the junctions of their multicast tree. The paper shows that despite of this restriction, the cost of the created multicast trees is not necessarily higher than the cost of the trees created by other algorithms that do not impose the restriction and therefore require all the nodes along the data path of a tree to participate in the routing over the tree and in the maintenance of the tree.},

We show that the CBT protocol can form loops during periods of routing instability, and that it can consistently fail to build a connected multicast tree, even when the underlying routing is stable. The OCBT protocol provably eliminates these deficiencies and reduces the latency of tree repair following a link or core failure. The OCBT also improves scalability by allowing flexible placement of the cores that serve as points of connection to a multicast tree. Simulation results show that the amount of control traffic in OCBT is comparable to that in CBT.},

abstract={Priority-based dynamic carrier allocation strategies can be classified into three categories: static-priority, dynamic-priority, and hybrid-priority strategies. Strategies based on static priorities do not consider the local carrier reuse conditions, while dynamic-priority strategies do take these conditions into consideration. Intuitively, one would expect dynamic-priority strategies to perform better than static- and hybrid-priority strategies, but in the literature it is the other way around-existing dynamic-priority strategies are out-performed by some static- and hybrid-priority strategies. We propose a dynamic-priority strategy which is a significant improvement over all existing strategies. Under various traffic conditions, our simulation results indicated that the proposed strategy could reduce the call blocking/failure rate by a margin ranging from 15% to 95%.},

abstract={Channel assignment problems in the time, frequency and code domains have thus far been studied separately. Exploiting the similarity of "constraints" that characterize assignments within and across these domains, we introduce the first unified framework for the study of assignment problems. Our framework identifies eleven atomic constraints underlying most current and potential assignment problems, and characterizes a problem as a combination of these constraints. Based on this framework, we present a unified algorithm for efficient (T/F/C)DMA channel assignments to nodes or to inter-nodal links in a (multihop) wireless network. The algorithm is parametrized to allow for tradeoff-selectable use as three different variants called random (RAND) ordering, minimum neighbors first (MNF), and progressive minimum neighbors first (PMNF). Using theoretical analysis, we show that the worst-case performance guarantee of PMNF is an order of magnitude better than that of the traditional RAND and MNF for most networks. We also experimentally study the relative performance for one node and one link assignment problem. We observe that PMNF performs the best, and that a larger fraction of unidirectional links degrades the performance in general.},

abstract={We present a new scheme that addresses the call handoff problem in mobile cellular networks. Efficiently solving the handoff problem is important for guaranteeing quality of service (QoS) to already admitted calls in the network. Our scheme is based on a new concept called channel carrying: when a mobile user moves from one cell to another, under certain mobility conditions, the user is allowed to carry its current channel. We propose a new channel assignment scheme to ensure that this movement of channels will not lead to any extra co-channel interference or channel locking. In our scheme, the mobility of the channels relies entirely on localized information, and no global coordination is required. Therefore, the scheme is simple and easy to implement. We further develop a hybrid channel carrying scheme that allows us to maximize the performance under various constraints. We provide numerical results comparing our scheme with the traditional channel reservation techniques. We find that our scheme outperforms the reservation scheme over a broad range of traffic parameters.},

abstract={Previous performance studies of PCS channel allocation assumed that call holding times have an exponential distribution. The exponential call holding time assumption is justified for existing cellular systems, where wireless calls are charged based on the length of the call holding time. Future PCS systems may exercise flat rate billing, and consequently a more general distribution is desirable to model the call holding times. This paper models the call holding times by the Erlang distribution (a generalization of the exponential distribution) to investigate the effect of the variance of the call holding times on the call completion probability. Our analysis indicates that the call completion probability decreases as the variance of the call holding times decreases. This effect becomes more pronounced as the variance of the cell residence times decreases.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and prototype of an intelligent, 3-dimensional-queue (3DQ) for high-performance, scalable, input-buffered ATM switches. The 3DQ uses pointers and linked lists to organize ATM cells into multiple virtual queues according to priority, destination, and virtual connection. It enforces per-virtual connection quality-of-service (QoS) and eliminates head-of-line (HOL) blocking. Using field-programmable-gate-array (FPGA) devices, our prototype hardware can process ATM cells at 622 Mb/s (OC-12). Using more aggressive technology (multi-chip-module (MCM) and fast GaAs logic), the same 3DQ can process cells at 2.5 Gb/s (OC-48). Using the 3DQ and matrix-unit-cell-scheduler (MUCS) as essential components, an input-buffered ATM switch system has been designed, which can achieve near-100% link bandwidth utilization.},

abstract={Groups of cells, such as cells belonging to different priority levels, that are all placed in one queue, can be identified by using labels or tags to distinguish them from each other. We describe a buffering device called a sequencer, which can distinguish logical queues within the same physical queue, and at the same time can successfully schedule the service among these logical queues. Scheduling the service among cells, VCs, or groups of cells in ATM switches is necessary to provide guaranteed QoS for each connection which is a major goal of ATM networks. The proposed sequencer is quite flexible and can realize different scheduling algorithms in different levels, including per VC scheduling. The sequencer can operate in real time and at very high speeds. It has a simple and modular architecture and can be implemented in a single chip. The site of the buffer can be increased simply by cascading several sequencers. The sequencer can be used as a traffic shaper, input buffer, output buffer, or a queue controller of RAM-based switches.},

number={},
pages={38-47 vol.1},
abstract={We propose a scheme for transmission of variable-bit-rate compressed video over ATM networks using the explicit-rate congestion control mechanisms proposed for the available bit rate (ABR) service. Compressed video is inherently bursty with rate fluctuations over both short and long time scales. We feel that this source behavior can naturally take advantage of the ABR service, since the ABR explicit-rate schemes allow sources to request varying amounts of bandwidth over time, while reserving a minimum for the entire duration of the connection. Moreover when the bandwidth demand cannot be met, the network provides feedback indicating the bandwidth currently available to a connection. This information can be used to match the video source rate to the available bandwidth by modifying the quantization level used during compression. We use trace driven simulations to examine how effective the enhanced explicit rate scheme is in "rate matching" between the network and the source and the effect on end-end delay. We also look at the sensitivity of the proposed scheme to the estimates of the network round-trip times and to inaccuracies in the rate requests made by sources.},

abstract={The transmission of variable-bit rate (VBR) video over ATM is a challenge because it combines the requirement for on-time data delivery with a bursty traffic characteristic. We focus on the role of ATM endsystems in the transmission of VBR video and examine how traffic shaping in the sender reduces the burstiness of the video stream and therefore the network resource requirements, both for video encoded in real-time and stored video. Shapers based on multiple leaky buckets are popular because they are particularly simple to implement. We present basic results on their buffer requirements and provide new, tighter bounds for their output traffic, enabling efficient resource allocation as well as a significant reduction in the number of leaky buckets required. We extend the basic shaping mechanism to provide efficient shaping for stored video. Finally we compare empirically the performance of multiple leaky bucket shaping with an optimal algorithm for MPEG-1 encoded video and find under realistic conditions near-optimal performance with very few leaky buckets.},

year={1997},

pages={58-66 vol.1},
abstract={The transfer of prerecorded, compressed video requires multimedia services to support large fluctuations in bandwidth requirements on multiple time scales. Bandwidth smoothing techniques can reduce the burstiness of a variable-bit-rate stream by prefetching data at a series of fixed rates, simplifying the allocation of resources in video servers and the communication network. Given a fixed client-side prefetch buffer several bandwidth smoothing algorithms have been introduced that are provably optimal under certain constraints. This paper presents a collection of metrics for comparing these smoothing algorithms and evaluating their cost-performance trade-offs. Due to the scarcity of available trace data, we have constructed a video capture testbed and generated a collection of twenty full-length, motion-JPEG encoded video clips. Using these video traces and a range of client buffer sizes, we investigate the interplay between the performance metrics through simulation experiments. The results highlight the unique strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.},

abstract={We present a novel bandwidth allocation scheme for transporting variable-bit-rate MPEG traffic from a video server. Using time-varying envelopes to characterize the traffic, this scheme achieves significant bandwidth gain, via statistical multiplexing, while supporting stringent, deterministic QoS guarantees. The gain can be maximized by allowing the server to appropriately schedule the starting times of video sources, at the expense of some negligible startup delay. For homogeneous streams, we give the optimal schedule that results in the minimum allocated bandwidth. A suboptimal schedule is given in the heterogeneous case, which is shown to be asymptotically optimal. Efficient online procedures for bandwidth computation are provided. Numerical examples based on traces of MPEG-coded movies are used to demonstrate the benefits of our allocation strategy.},

abstract={We study the NP-hard delay-constrained least-cost path problem, and propose a simple, distributed heuristic solution: the delay-constrained unicast routing (DCUR) algorithm. The DCUR requires limited network state information to be kept at each node: a cost vector and a delay vector. We prove the DCUR's correctness by showing that it is always capable of constructing a loop-free delay-constrained path within finite time, if such a path exists. The worst case message complexity of the DCUR is O(|V|/sup 3/) messages, where |V| is the number of nodes. However simulation results show that, on average, the DCUR requires much fewer messages. Therefore, the DCUR scales well to large networks. We also use simulation to compare the DCUR to the optimal algorithm, and to the least-delay path algorithm. Our results show that the DCUR's path costs are within 10% from those of the optimal solution.},

abstract={In high-speed networks it is desirable to interleave routing and resource (such as bandwidth) reservation. The PNNI standard for private ATM networks is an example of an algorithm that does this using a sequential crank-back mechanism. We suggest the implementation of resource reservation along several routes in parallel. We present an analytical model that demonstrates that when there are several routes to the destination it pays to attempt reservation along more than a single route. Following this analytic observation, we present a family of algorithms that route and reserve resources along parallel subroutes. The algorithms of the family represent different trade-offs between the speed and the quality of the established route. The presented algorithms are simulated against several legacy algorithms, including the PNNI crank-back, and exhibit higher network utilization and faster connection set-up time.},

abstract={Broadcast data delivery is encountered in many applications where there is a need to disseminate information to a large user community in a wireless asymmetric communication environment. We consider the problem of scheduling the data broadcast such that the access latency experienced by the users is low. In a push-based system, where the users cannot place requests directly to the server and the broadcast schedule should be determined based solely on the access probabilities, we formulate a deterministic dynamic optimization problem, the solution of which provides the optimal broadcast schedule. Properties of the optimal solution are obtained and then we propose a suboptimal dynamic policy which achieves mean access latency close to the lower bound. The policy has low complexity, it is adaptive to changing access statistics, and is easily generalized to multiple broadcast channels. In a pull-based system where the users may place requests about information items directly to the server, the scheduling can be based on the number of pending requests for each item. Suboptimal policies with good performance are obtained in this case as well. Finally, it is demonstrated by a numerical study that as the request generation rate increases, the achievable performance of the pull- and push-based systems becomes almost identical.},

abstract={Personal communications and mobile computing will require a wireless network infrastructure which is fast deployable, possibly multihop, and capable of multimedia service support. The first infracture of this type was the packet radio network (PRNET), developed in the 70's to address the battlefield and disaster recovery communication requirements. PRNET was totally asynchronous and was based on a completely distributed architecture. It handled datagram traffic reasonably well, but did not offer efficient multimedia support. Recently, under the WAMIS and Glomo ARPA programs several mobile, multimedia, multihop (M/sup 3/) wireless network architectures have been developed, which assume some form of synchronous, time division infrastructure. The synchronous time frame leads to efficient multimedia support implementations. However, it introduces more complexity and is less robust in the face of mobility and channel fading. In this paper; we examine the impact of synchronization on wireless M/sup 3/ network performance. First, we introduce MACA/PR, an asynchronous network based on the collision avoidance MAC scheme employed in the IEEE 802.11 standard. There, we evaluate and compare several wireless packet networks ranging from the total asynchronous PRNET to the synchronized cluster TDMA network. We examine the tradeoffs between time synchronization and performance in various traffic and mobility environments.},

abstract={Analysis of the draft IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN) standard is needed to characterize the expected performance of the standard's ad hoc and infrastructure networks. The performance of the medium access control (MAC) sublayer, which consists of distributed coordination function (DCF) and point coordination function (PCF), is determined by simulating asynchronous data traffic in a 1 Mbps ad hoc network, and asynchronous data and packetized voice traffic in a 1 Mbps infrastructure network. The simulation models incorporate the effect of burst errors, packet size, RTS threshold and fragmentation threshold on network throughput and delay. The results show that the IEEE 802.11 WLAN can achieve a reasonably high efficiency when the medium is almost error-free, but may degrade appreciably under harsh fading. The results also show that time-sensitive traffic such as packet voice can be supported together with other intensive traffic such as packet data. However, an echo canceller is required for packet voice systems.},

abstract={The CARMA-NTG protocol is presented and analyzed. CARMA-NTG dynamically divides the channel into cycles of variable length; each cycle consists of a contention period and a group-transmission period. During the contention period, a station with one or more packets to send competes for the right to be added to the group of stations allowed to transmit data without collisions; this is done using a collision resolution splitting algorithm based on a request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) message exchange with non-persistent carrier sensing. CARMA-NTG ensures that one station is added to the group transmission period if one or more stations send requests to be added in the previous contention period. The group-transmission period is a variable-length train of packets, which are transmitted by stations that have been added to the group by successfully completing an RTS/CTS message exchange in previous contention periods. As long as a station maintains its position in the group, it is able to transmit data packets without collision, An upper bound is derived for the average costs of obtaining the first success in the splitting algorithm. This bound is then applied to the computation of the average channel utilization in a fully connected network with a large number of stations. These results indicate that collision resolution is a powerful mechanism in combination with floor acquisition and group allocation multiple access.},

Based on the observations made in this study, we have developed two optimal connection preemption selection algorithms that operate in a decentralized/distributed network where individual link managers run the algorithm for connection preemption selection on their outgoing links. The first algorithm optimizes the criteria of (i) the number of connections to be preempted, (ii) the bandwidth to be preempted, and (iii) the priority of connections to be preempted, in that order, and has polynomial complexity. The second algorithm optimizes the criteria of (i) the bandwidth to be preempted, (ii) the priority of connections to be preempted, and (iii) the number of connections to be preempted, in that order, and has exponential complexity. We conclude that the polynomial algorithm is almost as good as the exponential algorithm in terms of overall network performance.},

abstract={Introducing the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) causes a backwards compatibility problem, because ATM is connection-oriented whereas most of today's LANs are connectionless. Interconnection can be achieved by the use of connectionless servers (CLS). These servers together with a number of preestablished virtual circuits form a connectionless overlay network on top of ATM. In this paper we evaluate overlay networks that differ in number location and interconnection of CLSs by computation of mean cell delay and link load.},

abstract={We address the issues of stability in ATM networks. A network is stable if and only if all the packets have a bounded delay. We first consider ATM networks with an FCFS scheduling policy. We then study networks with a priority driven scheduling policy. For each network, we develop criteria for testing the stability of an ATM network and methods of deriving delay bounds in a stable network. In previous work, the Cruz-Gallager-Parekh (1991, 1992) ring has been a "benchmark" architecture to study the stability problem. For example, Gallager and Parerkh (1993) claimed that the ring with a size of no more than four switches is stable when the total utilization of the links is less than 100%. We validated this result. Furthermore, we find that a ring with large number of switches is stable if the utilization of each link is less than or equal to 73%.},

pages={168-176 vol.1},
abstract={We consider the multiplexing of several variable bit rate (VBR) connections over one variable bit rate connection where the multiplexing uses a multiplexing buffer of size B. The VBR trunk is itself a connection and has a multidimensional connection descriptor, reflecting peak and sustainable rates. Given a cost function for the VBR trunk and a connection admission control (CAC) method for the input connections, we focus on the problem of finding the VBR trunk connection descriptor that minimizes the cost function and is able to accept set given set of VBR input connections. First, we show that, under reasonable assumptions on the cost function, the optimization problem can be reduced to a simpler one. Then we consider the homogeneous, loss-free case, for which we give an explicit CAC method. In this case, we find that, for all reasonable cost functions, the optimal VBR trunk is either of the CBR type, or is truly VBR, with a burst duration equal to the burst duration of the input connections. We show that the optimal peak cell rate is fixed for a given B (thus for a CBR trunk), and a VBR choice can only be an improvement. Lastly, we take as an example of the cost function the equivalent capacity of the VBR trunk. These results are expected to form the basis for a general method for a connection manager at a multiplexing node in an integrated services packet network.},

abstract={This paper develops fast algorithms for construction of circulant modulated rate process to match with two primary traffic statistical functions: distribution f(x) and autocorrelation R(/spl tau/) of the rate process. Using existing modeling techniques, f(x) has to be limited to certain forms such as Gaussian or binomial; R(/spl tau/) can only consist of one or two exponential terms which are often real exponentials rather than complex. In reality, these two functions are collective for real traffic traces and generally expressed in a much more complicated form. Our emphasis here is placed on the algorithmic design for matching complicated R(/spl tau/) in traffic modeling. The typical CPU time for the traffic modeling with R(/spl tau/) consisting of five or six complex exponential terms is found in the range of a few minutes by the proposed algorithms. Our study further shows an excellent agreement between original traffic traces and sequences generated by the matched analytical model.},

For a simple subexponential on-off fluid flow queue we establish a precise asymptotic relation between the Palm queue distribution and the time average queue distribution. Further, a queueing system in which one on-off source, whose on period belongs to a subclass of subexponential distributions, is multiplexed with independent exponential sources with aggregate expected rate Ee/sub t/, is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the same queueing system with the exponential arrival processes being replaced by their total mean value Ee/sub t/. For a fluid queue with the limiting M/G//spl infin/ arrivals we obtain a tight asymptotic lower bound for large buffer probabilities. Based on this bound, we suggest a computationally efficient approximation for the case of finitely many subexponential on-off sources. The accuracy of this approximation is verified with extensive simulation experiments.},

For very large DIS applications with 100000 entities, the current method of broadcasting information among entities will no longer be feasible due to the computational and network bandwidth limitations. Our scheme divides the simulation space into grids and each grid square or a set of grid squares forms a multicast group. Entities join the groups within their perception range and thus, they receive state updates only from entities within their perception range. The AMCC utilizes the unique capabilities of our dynamic multipoint ATM signaling protocol, CMAP. We have implemented the AMCC and have successfully demonstrated a small DIS battlefield simulation application running over our ATM testbed.},

number={},
pages={222-229 vol.1},
abstract={Soft state protocols use periodic refresh messages to keep the network state alive while adapting to changing network conditions; this has raised concerns regarding the scalability of protocols that use the soft state approach. In existing soft state protocols, the values of the timers that control the sending of these messages, and the timers for aging out state, are chosen by matching empirical observations with desired recovery and response times. These fixed timer-values fail because they use time as a metric for bandwidth; they adapt neither to (1) the wide range of link speeds that exist in most wide-area internets, nor to (2) fluctuations in the amount of network state over time. We propose and evaluate a new approach in which timer-values adapt dynamically to the volume of control traffic and available bandwidth on the link. The essential mechanisms required to realize this scalable timers approach are: (1) dynamic adjustment of the senders' refresh rate so that the bandwidth allocated for control traffic is not exceeded, and (2) estimation of the senders' refresh rate at the receiver in order to determine when the state can be timed-out and deleted. The refresh messages are sent in a round robin manner not exceeding the bandwidth allocated to the control traffic, and taking into account the message priorities. We evaluate two receiver estimation methods for dynamically adjusting network state timeout values: (1) counting of the rounds and (2) exponential weighted moving average.},

To address this, we introduce the concept of design protection, which aims at making such failure propagation impossible. We present the disjoint alternate path (DAP) algorithm which places optical channels in order to maximise design protection. We show the result on the example of the ARPA-2 network.},

pages={253-260 vol.1},
abstract={We propose a pipelined optical sorting network to sort N w-bit inputs using O(wNlogN) single bit-controlled 2/spl times/2 switching elements. The network is compared to the standard Batcher (1968) sorter which requires (O(Nlog/sup 2/N)) two-input comparators for sorting N log N-bit words. However each comparator in the Batcher sorter has to perform a word comparison between two log N bit inputs, as opposed to single-bit controlled switching elements in the proposed scheme. An alternative implementation of the proposed network maintains the same hardware complexity while showing an O(loglogN) improvement in latency over the Batcher sorter. The proposed network is based on binary radix sort and utilizes a pair of self-routing reverse banyan networks to implement each step of the radix-sort algorithm. A distributed single-bit control scheme due to a particular non-blocking property of the reverse banyan network is used to route packets through each reverse banyan. Given the high cost of optical switches, the low hardware and control complexity of the network makes it easy to replace electronic switching elements with 2/spl times/2 lithium niobate directional couplers, thus making the network attractive for high-speed optical applications.},

abstract={Optical networks based on passive star couplers and employing wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) have been proposed for deployment in local and metropolitan areas. Amplifiers are required in such networks to compensate for the power losses due to splitting and attenuation. However, an optical amplifier has constraints on the maximum gain and the maximum output power it can supply; thus optical amplifier placement becomes a challenging problem. The general problem of minimizing the total amplifier count, subject to the device constraints, is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem. Previous studies have attacked the amplifier-placement problem by adding the "artificial" constraint that all wavelengths, which are present at a particular point in a fiber, be at the same power level. In this paper, we present a method to solve the minimum-amplifier-placement problem while avoiding the equally-powered-wavelength constraint. We demonstrate-that, by allowing signals to operate at different power levels, our method can reduce the number of amplifiers required in several small to medium-sized networks.},

abstract={We consider a wavelength-routed optical network operated as a lightpath-based virtual topology. We present an exact linear programming formulation for the complete virtual topology design, including choice of constituent lightpaths, routes for these lightpaths, and intensity of packet flows through these lightpaths. By making a shift in the objective function to minimal hop distance and by relaxing the wavelength-continuity constraints (i.e., assuming wavelength converters at all nodes), we demonstrate that the entire optical network design problem can be linearized and hence solved optimally. The linear formulation can be used to design a balanced network, such that the utilizations of both transceivers and wavelengths are high, i.e., neither of these expensive resources are under-utilized. We also use the linear formulation to provide a reconfiguration methodology in order to adapt the virtual topology to changing traffic conditions.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the important stability issue of ABR traffic control with explicit-rate schemes. We develop a novel design approach with three advantages. First, the ABR rate is only adapted to the low-frequency variation of the underlying VBR traffic, which effectively prevents network congestion with much improved control stability. Second, a linear dynamic model is presented which makes the optimal control theory readily applied to the design of ABR control. Third, the control of different ABR loops is uncoupled, which significantly simplifies the control scheme. With this approach, stability analysis for the controlled network becomes feasible with the knowledge of VBR traffic characteristics. We propose a new explicit-rate ABR control scheme, called the H/sub 2/ scheme, which has the same level of design complexity as the existing schemes but with rigorously proved stability. The stability problem of the existing explicit rate schemes is also considered.},

abstract={We present a control theoretic approach to the design of closed loop rate based flow control in high speed networks. The proposed control uses a dual proportional derivative controller, where the control parameters can be designed to ensure the stability of the control loop in a control theoretic sense, over a wide range of traffic patterns and propagation delays. We show how the control mechanism can be used to design a controller to support available bit rate (ABR) service based on feedback of explicit rates. We demonstrate the excellent transient and steady state performance of the controller through a number of examples.},

abstract={We propose an approach to design a rate-based proportional traffic controller in order to flow-regulate the best-effort service (e.g., ABR traffic) and guaranteed service traffic through an ATM switch. The controller is distributed and it has a very simple structure. Its local controller at each source node is open-loop stable and only requires the knowledge of the buffer occupancy at the bottleneck switch. We show that this controller is fair and is not sensitive to the change of virtual connections (VCs) over time. It does not have oscillations and can achieve a high utilization.},

We show that the algorithms have very low computational complexity and are easily applicable in practice. The complexity can be further decreased by introducing the notion of flex classes. We evaluate the penalty in efficiency that the classes incur to the EDF scheduler. We find that this efficiency degradation can be made arbitrarily small and is acceptable even for a small number of classes.},

abstract={We propose a generalized longest queue first (GLQF) service discipline for ATM networks. We classify sources so that sources in one class have the same cell loss probability requirement. Assume that there are N classes of traffic. Under this discipline, buffer i is assigned a positive number w/sub i/ for the weight of buffer i. The scheduler transmits a cell from the buffer that has the maximal weighted queue length. The advantage of this discipline is that it can adapt to temporary overload quickly. We approximate the queue length distribution by decomposing the system into N single server queues with probabilistic service discipline. Our method is an iterative one, which we prove to be convergent by using stochastic dominance arguments and the coupling technique. For high utilization, we present a heavy traffic limit theorem.},

volume={1},

pages={326-335 vol.1},
abstract={We introduce a general methodology for designing integrated shaping and scheduling algorithms for packet networks that provide fairness, low end-to-end delay, and low burstiness. The methodology is based on integrating a shaping mechanism with a scheduler from the class of rate-proportional servers (RPS) defined by Stiliadis and Varma (see Proceedings of ACM SIGMETRICS '96, p.104-15, 1996). The resulting algorithms provide an end-to-end delay bound identical to that of weighted fair queueing. Their worst-case fairness, in terms of minimizing the worst-case delay to empty the session backlog, is much superior to that of weighted fair queueing, and equal to the best known for any scheduling algorithm. In addition, the algorithms achieve a level of fairness in the distribution of free bandwidth among competing sessions better than that of weighted fair queueing. We show that, under this framework, even an unfair scheduling algorithm belonging to the RPS class, such as VirtualClock, can yield worst-case fairness identical to that obtained with weighted fair queueing. We also develop an integrated shaper-scheduler that provides optimal output burstiness and is attractive for use in both network adapters and in switches that support traffic re-shaping. We describe an efficient implementation of this integrated shaping and scheduling algorithm with log/sub 2/(V) complexity, where V is the number of sessions sharing the outgoing link.},

abstract={In self-healing networks, end-to-end restoration schemes have been considered more advantageous than line restoration schemes because of a possible cost reduction of the total capacity to construct a fully restorable network. This paper clarifies the benefit of end-to-end restoration schemes quantitatively through a comparative analysis of the minimum link capacity installation cost. A jointly optimal capacity and flow assignment algorithm is developed for the self-healing ATM networks based on end-to-end and line restoration. Several networks with diverse topological characteristics as well as multiple projected traffic demand patterns are employed in the experiments to see the effect of various network parameters. The results indicate that the network topology has a significant impact on the required resource installation cost for each restoration scheme. Contrary to a wide belief in the economic advantage of the end-to-end restoration scheme, this study reveals that the attainable gain could be marginal for a well-connected and/or unbalanced network.},

abstract={This paper studies the capacity and flow assignment problem arising in the design of self-healing ATM networks using the virtual path (VP) concept. The problem is formulated as a linear programming problem which is solved using standard methods. The objective is to minimize the spare capacity cost for the given restoration requirement. The spare cost depends on the restoration strategies used in the network. We compare several restoration strategies, notably, global versus failure-oriented reconfiguration, path versus link based restoration and state-dependent versus state-independent restoration, quantitatively in terms of spare cost. The advantages and disadvanages of various restoration strategies are also highlighted. Such comparisons provide useful guidance for real network design. Further, a new heuristic algorithm is developed for the design of large self-healing ATM networks using path based restoration. Numerical results illustrate that the heuristic algorithm is efficient and can give near-optimal solutions for spare capacity allocation and flow assignment.},

pages={361-369 vol.1},
abstract={In this paper, we propose a fast restoration mechanism for virtual path-based ATM networks. Given an ATM network topology, the capacity of each physical link, and the primary virtual path (VP) layout at system initialization, the proposed mechanism pre-assigns to each primary VP one backup VP such that (P1) the failure of a single node/link does not lead to the failure of both the primary and backup VPs, (P2) the alternate backup VP is routed on a path with the shortest hop count among all possible paths with sufficient bandwidth between the two VP terminators, and (P3) the maximum link load is minimized. During system operation, if a physical node/link fails, the proposed mechanism restores the VPs that traverse the failed node/link simply by redirecting cells on the failed VPs to their corresponding backup VPs. Moreover, the proposed mechanism also locates (i) new VPs for injured backup VPs that traverse the failed node/link, and (ii) second-generation backup VPs for newly-activated backup VPs that replace their corresponding failed primary VPs, both in a decentralized manner. We elaborate on all the component algorithms, and discuss how to configure the functionalities as software daemons that reside at each network node. The proposed mechanism is shown via event-driven simulation to be practically feasible in fast restoring failed VPs in a cost effective manner.},

abstract={Due to the increasing reliance of society on the timely and reliable transfer of large quantities of information (such as voice, data, and video) across high speed communication networks, it is becoming important for a network to offer survivability, or at least graceful degradation, in the event of network failure. In this paper we aim to offer a solution in the selection of the K-best disjoint paths through a network by using graph theoretic techniques. The basic approach is to map an arbitrary network graph into a trellis graph which allows the application of computationally efficient methods to find disjoint paths. Use of the knowledge of the K-best disjoint paths for improving the survivability of ATM networks at the virtual path and virtual circuit level is discussed.},
