abstract={Ethernet networks rely on the so-called spanning tree protocol (IEEE 802.1d) in order to break cycles, thereby avoiding the possibility of infinitely circulating packets and deadlocks. This protocol imposes a severe penalty on the performance and scalability of large gigabit Ethernet backbones, since it makes inefficient use of expensive fibers and may lead to bottlenecks. We propose a significantly more scalable cycle-breaking approach, based on the novel theory of turn-prohibition. Specifically, we introduce, analyze and evaluate a new algorithm, called tree-based turn-prohibition (TBTP). We show that this polynomial-time algorithm maintains backward-compatibility with the IEEE 802.1d standard and never prohibits more than 1/2 of the turns in the network, for any given graph and any given spanning tree. Through extensive simulations on a variety of graph topologies, we show that it can lead to an order of magnitude improvement over the spanning tree protocol with respect to throughput and end-of-end delay metrics. In addition, we propose and evaluate heuristics to determine the replacement order of legacy switches that results in the fastest performance improvement.},

abstract={Despite increasing bandwidth demand and the significant research and commercial activity in large-scale terabit routers for multi-gigabit/s links, many current switch designs do not provide adequate support for rate guarantees. In particular, designs based on the popular combined-input/output-queueing (CIOQ) paradigm have unpredictable performance despite implementing sophisticated scheduling schemes on egress links, because the crossbar arbitration between ingress and egress links is done without regard to desired rate guarantees or prevailing traffic conditions. This work describes the design of an input-queued switch system and its associated arbitration and rate allocation algorithms that achieve both absolute rate guarantees and proportional bandwidth sharing even under overloaded or adversarial traffic. Our algorithms are simple and scalable and require a switch speedup of two to provide rate guarantees; we give the theoretical justification and report on simulation results that justify our claims. A semiconductor chipset based on variants of these algorithms for routers with an aggregate capacity of 160 Gbps with links up to 10 Gbps is now commercially available, and a second-generation chipset supporting 640 Gbps is also available.},

abstract={Many network devices such as routers and firewalls employ caches to take advantage of temporal locality of packet headers in order to speed up packet processing decisions. Traditionally, cache designs trade off time and space with the goal of balancing the overall cost and performance of the device. We examine another axis of the design space that has not been previously considered: accuracy. In particular, we quantify the benefits of relaxing the accuracy of the cache on the cost and performance of packet classification caches. Our cache design is based on the popular Bloom filter data structure. This paper provides a model for optimizing Bloom filters for this purpose, as well as extensions to the data structure to support graceful aging, bounded misclassification rates, and multiple binary predicates. Given this, we show that such caches can provide nearly an order of magnitude cost savings at the expense of misclassifying one billionth of packets for IPv6-based caches.},

pages={2208-2219 vol.4},
abstract={Optical CDMA local area networks allow shared access to a broadcast medium. Every node on the network is assigned an optical orthogonal codeword (OOC) to transmit or receive on. OOCs are designed to be pseudo-orthogonal, i.e., the correlation (and therefore the interference) between pairs of codewords is constrained. This paper demonstrates that the use of optical CDMA does not preclude the need for a media access control (MAC) layer protocol to resolve contention for the shared media. OOCs have low spectral efficiency. As more codewords are transmitted simultaneously, the interference between codewords increases and the network throughput falls. This paper analyzes a network architecture where there is virtually no MAC layer, except for choice of the codeset, and shows that its throughput degrades and collapses under moderate to heavy load. We propose an alternate architecture called interference avoidance where nodes on the network use media access mechanisms to avoid causing interference on the line, thereby improving network throughput. Interference avoidance is analyzed and it is shown that it can provide up to 30% improvement in throughput with low delays and no throughput collapse. We validate our analysis through simulation with realistic network traffic traces.},

abstract={Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing has emerged as a popular model aiming at further utilizing Internet information and resources, complementing the available client-server services. However, the mechanism of peers randomly choosing logical neighbors without any knowledge about underlying physical topology can cause a serious topology mismatching between the P2P overlay network and the physical underlying network. The topology mismatching problem brings a great stress in the Internet infrastructure and greatly limits the performance gain from various search or routing techniques. Meanwhile, due to the inefficient overlay topology, the flooding-based search mechanisms cause a large volume of unnecessary traffic. Aiming at alleviating the mismatching problem and reducing the unnecessary traffic, we propose a location-aware topology matching (LTM) technique, an algorithm of building an efficient overlay by disconnecting low productive connections and choosing physically closer nodes as logical neighbors while still retaining the search scope and reducing response time for queries. LTM is scalable and completely distributed in the sense that it does not require any global knowledge of the whole overlay network when each node is optimizing the organization of its logical neighbors. The effectiveness of LTM is demonstrated through simulation studies.},

abstract={We describe a method for performing trust-preserving set operations by untrusted parties. Our motivation for this is the problem of securely reusing content-based search results in peer-to-peer networks. We model search results and indexes as data sets. Such sets have value for answering a new query only if they are trusted. In the absence of any system-wide security mechanism, a data set is trusted by a node a only if it was generated by some node which is trusted by a. Our main contributions are a formal definition of the problem as well as an efficient scheme that solves this problem by allowing untrusted peers to perform set operations on trusted data sets while also producing unforgeable proofs of correctness. This is accomplished by requiring trusted nodes to sign appropriately-defined digests of generated sets; each such digest consists of an RSA accumulator and a Bloom filter. The scheme is general, and has other applications as well. We give an analysis demonstrating the low overhead of the scheme, and we include experimental data which confirm the analysis.},

abstract={We study the 'service capacity' of peer to peer (P2P) file sharing applications. We begin by considering a transient regime which is key to capturing the ability of such systems to handle bursty traffic, e.g., flash crowds. In this context our models, based on age dependent branching processes, exhibit exponential growth in service capacity, and permit the study of sensitivity of this growth to system policies and parameters. Then we consider a model for such systems in steady state and show how the average delay seen by peers would scale in the offered load and rate at which peers exit the system. We find that the average delays scale well in the offered load. In particular the delays are upper bounded by some constant given any offered load and even decrease in the offered load if peers exit the system slowly. We validate many of our findings by analyzing traces obtained from a second generation P2P application called BitTorrent.},

pages={2253-2262 vol.4},
abstract={Most P2P systems that provide a DHT abstraction distribute objects randomly among "peer nodes" in a way that results in some nodes having /spl theta/(log N) times as many objects as the average node. Further imbalance may result due to non-uniform distribution of objects in the identifier space and a high degree of heterogeneity in object loads and node capacities. Additionally, a node's load may vary greatly over time since the system can be expected to experience continuous insertions and deletions of objects, skewed object arrival patterns, and continuous arrival and departure of nodes. We propose an algorithm for load balancing in such heterogeneous, dynamic P2P systems. Our simulation results show that in the face of rapid arrivals and departures of objects of widely varying load, our algorithm achieves load balancing for system utilizations as high as 90% while moving only about 8% of the load that arrives into the system. Similarly, in a dynamic system where nodes arrive and depart, our algorithm moves less than 60% of the load the underlying DHT moves due to node arrivals and departures. Finally, we show that our distributed algorithm performs only negligibly worse than a similar centralized algorithm, and that node heterogeneity helps, not hurts, the scalability of our algorithm.},

abstract={We describe a new network service called speccast. Speccast offers a generalized addressing and routing abstraction on which a rich variety of semantic services can be built, and, as such, provides a vehicle for studying the relationships among routing, addressing and topology. Unlike overlay-based systems, we study a more basic problem, in which the topology of the network is given, and there is not necessarily any pre-existing underlying network service. In the speccast model, each packet carries a destination predicate and the network's job is to deliver the packet to all nodes satisfying that predicate. After showing how this generalized routing service subsumes other services both traditional (unicast, multicast) and emerging (publish-subscribe), we present a layered solution for a specific class of simple predicates. We examine the tradeoffs in various forms of our approach, and compare it to existing solutions for unicast and multicast. Studies using transit-stub graphs show that our generic service performs comparably to existing solutions for traditional services, while also effectively supporting new and emerging services.},

abstract={A virtual private network (VPN) provides private network connections over a publicly accessible shared network. Bandwidth provisioning for VPNs leads to challenging optimization problems. In the hose model proposed by Duffield et al., each VPN endpoint specifies bounds on the total amount of traffic that it will send or receive at any time. The network provider must provision the VPN so that there is sufficient bandwidth for any traffic matrix that is consistent with these bounds. While previous work has considered tree routing and single-path routing between the VPN endpoints, we demonstrate that the use of multipath routing offers significant advantages. On the one band, we present an optimal polynomial-time algorithm that computes a bandwidth reservation of minimum cost using multi-path routing. This is in contrast to tree routing and single-path routing, where the problem is computationally hard. On the other hand, we present experimental results showing that the reservation cost using multi-path routing can indeed be significantly smaller than with tree or single-path routing.},

abstract={Simplicity, cost effectiveness, scalability, and the economies of scale make Ethernet a popular choice for local area networks, as well as for storage area networks and increasingly metropolitan-area networks. These applications of Ethernet elevate it from a LAN technology to a ubiquitous networking technology, thus prompting a rethinking of some of its architectural features. One weakness of existing Ethernet architecture is its use of single spanning tree, which, while useful at avoiding routing loops, leads to low link utilization and long failure recovery time. To apply Ethernet to cluster networks and MANs, these problems need to be addressed. We propose a multi-spanning-tree Ethernet architecture, called Viking, that improves both aggregate throughput and fault tolerance by exploiting standard virtual LAN technology in a novel way. By supporting multiple spanning trees through VLAN, Viking makes the most of the inherent redundancies in most mesh-like networks and delivers a multi-fold throughput gain over single-spanning-tree Ethernet with the same physical network topology. It also provides much faster failure recovery, reducing the down-time to a sub-second range from that of multiple seconds in single-spanning-tree Ethernet architecture. Finally, based only on standard mechanisms, Viking is readily implementable on commodity Ethernet switches without any firmware modifications.},

title={Impact of flow dynamics on traffic engineering design principles},
year={2004},
volume={4},

pages={2295-2306 vol.4},
abstract={A common traffic engineering design principle is to select a small set of flows, that account for a large fraction of the overall traffic, to be differentially treated inside the network so as to achieve a specific performance objective. We illustrate that one needs to be careful in implementing such an approach because there are tradeoffs to be addressed that arise due to traffic dynamics. We demonstrate that Internet flows are very volatile in terms of volume, and may substantially change the volume of traffic they transmit as time evolves. Currently proposed schemes for flow classification, although attractive due to their simplicity, face challenges due to this property of flows. Bandwidth volatility impacts the amount of load captured in a set of flows, which usually drops both significantly and quickly after flow classification is performed. Thus if the goal is to capture a large fraction of traffic consistently over time, flows will need to be reselected often. Our first contribution is in understanding the impact of flow volatility on the classification schemes employed in a traffic engineering context. Our second contribution is to propose a classification scheme that is capable of addressing the issues identified above by incorporating historical flow information. Using actual Internet data we demonstrate that our scheme outperforms previously proposed schemes, and reduces both the impact of flow volatility on the load captured by the selected set of flows and the required frequency for its reselection.},

Failures are first classified based on probable causes such as maintenance activities, router-related and optical layer problems. Key temporal and spatial characteristics of each class are analyzed and, when appropriate, parameterized using well-known distributions. Our results indicate that 20% of all failures is due to planned maintenance activities. Of the unplanned failures, almost 30% are shared by multiple links and can be attributed to router-related and optical equipment-related problems, while 70% affect a single link at a time. Our classification of failures according to different causes reveals the nature and extent of failures in today's IP backbones. Furthermore, our characterization of the different classes can be used to develop a probabilistic failure model, which is important for various traffic engineering problems.},

The integrated traffic engineering paradigm provides mechanisms for dynamic addition of physical capacity to optical networks. In the absence of such mechanisms, the rejection of incoming requests will be higher. The objective of the proposed policy is to minimize the costs involving bandwidth, switching and signaling. The policy is derived by utilizing the Markov decision process theory. The new policy is split into two levels: the MPLS network level and the optical network level. In addition to the optimal policy, a sub-optimal policy and a threshold-based policy are also proposed which are less computationally intensive but have comparable performance to the optimal policy. The proposed policies have been evaluated by simulation and compared to some heuristics. Numerical results, which show their effectiveness and the achieved performance improvement, are presented.},

year={2004},
volume={4},
number={},
pages={2329-2340 vol.4},
abstract={Fast restoration is an important feature of both MPLS and optical networks. The main mechanism for achieving fast restoration is by locally routing around failures using pre-setup detour paths. Signaling and routing protocol extensions to implement this local bypass ability are currently being standardized. To make use of this ability, dynamic schemes that jointly route primary paths and all link detours for links used by the primary paths have been previously proposed. These schemes also permit sharing of reserved restoration capacity for achieving efficiency. However, this joint computation places a significantly larger computational load on the network elements than that imposed by the shortest path computation variants typically used for unprotected network connection routing. We propose a new scheme that is operationally much simpler, shares capacity used for restoration, and permits the network to route the primary paths in a manner that is oblivious to restoration needs. Restoration of all carried traffic is guaranteed by a new link capacity partitioning scheme that maximizes the working capacity of the network without requiring any knowledge of the traffic that will be imposed on the network. Being traffic independent for a priori link capacity partitioning and being oblivious to restoration needs for on-line network routing makes this scheme operationally simple and desirable in the sense of placing no additional routing load on the constrained computing resources at the network nodes. To compute the link capacity partitions, we develop a fast combinatorial algorithm that uses only iterative shortest path computations, and is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS), i.e., it achieves a (1 + /spl epsi/)-factor approximation for any /spl epsi/> 0 and runs in time polynomial in the input size and 1//spl epsi/.The approximation scheme also allows link detour paths to be hop constrained if needed so as to bound restoration latency in optical networks.},

abstract={We consider the traffic matrix estimation problem in IP backbone networks, whose goal is to accurately estimate the volume of traffic traveling between network endpoints. Previous approaches to this problem involve measuring the volume of traffic on each link in the network during a time interval where the routing configuration is fixed, and exploit a statistical model of the traffic in order to obtain an estimate of the traffic matrix. These previous approaches are prone to large estimation errors because the link measurements from a fixed muting scenario constitute a data set that is simply too limited to provide enough data to enable estimation procedures that yield very small errors. We propose the idea of collecting link measurements under multiple routing scenarios so that the traffic matrix can be determined very accurately. We present an algorithm for determining a sequence of routing configurations, each of which is specified by a set of link weights. We incorporate carrier requirements into our algorithm so that our proposed routing configurations are operationally viable. We present the results of applying our algorithm to some representative IP backbone topologies and discuss the performance trade-offs that arise.},

abstract={We consider the steady state distribution of the end-to-end delay of a tagged flow in queueing networks where the queues have self-similar cross traffic. We assume that such cross traffic at each queue, say queue I, is modeled by fractional Brownian motion (FBM) with Hurst parameter H/sub i/ /spl isin/ (1/2,1), and is independent of other queues. The arrival process of the tagged flow is renewal. Two types of queueing networks are considered. We show that the end-to-end delay of the tagged flow in a tandem queueing network, and more generally in a tree network, is completely dominated by one of the queues. The dominant queue is the one with the maximal Hurst parameter. If several queues have the same maximal Hurst parameter, then we have to compare the ratio (1-/spl rho/)/sup H///spl sigma/ to determine the dominant queue, where /spl rho/ is the load of the queue and /spl sigma/ is the coefficient of variation of the cross traffic at the queue. In the case that the tagged flow is controlled through a window based congestion control mechanism, the end-to-end delay is still asymptotically Weibullian with the same shape parameter. We provide upper and lower bounds on the constant that determines the scale parameter of the corresponding Weibull distribution.},

abstract={We consider the issue of protection in very large networks displaying randomness in topology. We employ random graph models to describe such networks, and obtain probabilistic bounds on several parameters related to reliability. In particular, we take the case of random regular networks for simplicity and consider the length of primary and backup paths in terms of the number of hops. First, for a randomly picked pair of nodes, we derive a lower bound on the average distance between the pair and discuss the tightness of the bound. In addition, noting that primary and protection paths form cycles, we obtain a lower bound on the average length of the shortest cycle around the pair. Finally, we show that the protected connections of a given maximum finite length are rare. We then generalize our network model so that different degrees are allowed according to some arbitrary distribution, and show that the second moment of degree over the first moment is an important shorthand for behavior of a network. Notably, we show that most of the results in regular networks carry over with minor modifications, which significantly broadens the scope of networks to which our approach applies. We present as an example the case of networks with a power-law degree distribution.},

abstract={Protocols such as TCP require packets to be accepted, i.e., delivered to the receiving application, in the order they are transmitted at the sender. Packets that arrive at the receiving host may be mis-ordered for reasons such as retransmission of dropped packets or multi-path routing. In order to deliver the arrived packets in sequence, the receiver's transport layer is responsible to temporarily buffer out-of-order packets and to resequence them as more packets arrive. We analyze a model where the mis-ordering is caused by multi-path routing. Packets are generated according to a Poisson process. Then, they arrive at a disordering network modelled by two parallel M/M/1 queues, and are routed to each of the queues according to an independent Bernoulli process. A resequencing buffer follows the disordering network. In such a model, the packet resequencing delay is known. However, the size of the resequencing queue is unknown. We derive the probability for the large deviation of the queue size.},

abstract={Packet scheduling is an important mechanism to provide QoS guarantees in data networks. A scheduling algorithm generally consists of two functions: one estimates how the GPS (general processor sharing) clock progresses with respect to the real time; the other decides the order of serving packets based on an estimation of their GPS start/finish times. In this work, we answer important open questions concerning the computational complexity of performing the first function. We systematically study the complexity of computing the GPS virtual start/finish times of the packets, which has long been believed to be /spl Omega/(n) per packet but has never been either proved or refuted. We also answer several other related questions such as "whether the complexity can be lower if the only thing that needs to be computed is the relative order of the GPS finish times of the packets rather than their exact values?".},

abstract={Secure communication is very important in computer networks and authentication is one of the most eminent preconditions. However, common authentication schemes are not applicable in ad hoc networks because public key infrastructures with a centralized certification authority are hard to deploy there. We propose and evaluate a security concept based on a distributed certification facility. A network is divided into clusters with one special head node each. These cluster head nodes execute administrative functions and hold shares of a network key used for certification. New nodes start to participate in the network as guests; they can only become full members with a network-signed certificate after their authenticity has been warranted by some other members. The feasibility of this concept was verified by simulation. Three different models for node mobility were used in order to include realistic scenarios as well as make the results comparable to other work. The simulation results include an evaluation of the log-on times, availability, and communication overhead.},

abstract={Security is a critical issue in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). We propose and investigate a novel scheme, security protocol for reliable data delivery (SPREAD), to enhance the data confidentiality service in a mobile ad hoc network. The proposed SPREAD scheme aims to provide further protection to secret messages from being compromised (or eavesdropped) when they are delivered across the insecure network. The basic idea is to transform a secret message into multiple shares by secret sharing schemes and then deliver the shares via multiple independent paths to the destination so that even if a small number of nodes that are used to relay the message shares are compromised, the secret message as a whole is not compromised. We present the overall system architecture and investigate the major design issues. We first describe how to obtain message shares using the secret sharing schemes. Then we study the appropriate choice of the secret sharing schemes and the optimal allocation of the message shares onto each path in order to maximize the security. The results show that the SPREAD is more secure and also provides a certain degree of reliability without sacrificing the security. Thirdly, the multipath routing techniques are discussed and the path set optimization algorithm is developed to find the multiple paths with the desired property, i.e., the overall path set providing maximum security. Finally, we present the simulation results to justify the feasibility and evaluate the effectiveness of SPREAD.},

pages={2414-2424 vol.4},
abstract={Key management is an essential cryptographic primitive upon which other security primitives are built. However, none of the existing key management schemes are suitable for ad hoc networks. They are either too inefficient, not functional on an arbitrary or unknown network topology, or not tolerant to a changing network topology or link failures. Recent research on distributed sensor networks suggests that key pre-distribution schemes (KPS) are the only practical option for scenarios where the network topology is not known prior to deployment. However, all of the existing KPS schemes rely on trusted third parties (TTP) rendering them inapplicable in many ad hoc networking scenarios and thus restricting them from wide-spread use in ad hoc networks. To eliminate this reliance on TTP, we introduce distributed key pre-distribution scheme (DKPS) and construct the first DKPS prototype to realize fully distributed and self-organized key pre-distribution without relying on any infrastructure support. DKPS overcomes the main limitations of the previous schemes, namely the needs of TTP and an established routing infrastructure. It minimizes the requirements posed on the underlying networks and can be easily applied to the ad hoc networking scenarios where key pre-distribution schemes were previously inapplicable. Finally, DKPS is robust to changing topology and broken links and can work before any routing infrastructure has been established, thus facilitating the widespread deployment of secure ad hoc networks.},

abstract={When compared with a fixed host that is connected to a hardwired network, a mobile nude in the MANET may change its IP address more frequently due to the deployment of autoconfiguration, global connectivity, and hierarchical addressing schemes. When an IP address changes, the performance of unicast routing protocols and real-time communications may degrade, and privacy may be compromised within the MANET. Although there have been some autoconfiguration algorithms proposed for the assignment of unique IP addresses to mobile nodes, the overhead resulting from address changes has not been carefully examined. Based on studies of the overhead caused by address change, an IP address handoff solution, which extends the unicast routing protocol and network address translation (NAT) scheme, is proposed in the paper. The proposed approach is able to offset the overhead of broken routing fabrics and on-going communications, which is supported by our analysis and a prototype implementation.},

abstract={Sensor nodes have limited sensing range and are not very reliable. To obtain accurate sensing data, many sensor nodes should he deployed and then the collaboration among them becomes an important issue. In W. Zhang and G. Cao, a tree-based approach has been proposed to facilitate sensor nodes collaborating in detecting and tracking a mobile target. As the target moves, many nodes in the tree may become faraway from the root of the tree, and hence a large amount of energy may be wasted for them to send their sensing data to the root. We address the tree reconfiguration problem. We formalize it as finding a min-cost convoy tree sequence, and solve it by proposing an optimized complete reconfiguration scheme and an optimized interception-based reconfiguration scheme. Analysis and simulation are conducted to compare the proposed schemes with each other and with other reconfiguration schemes. The results show that the proposed schemes are more energy efficient than others.},

pages={2446-2457 vol.4},
abstract={In a large-scale sensor network individual sensors are subject to security compromises. A compromised node can inject into the network large quantities of bogus sensing reports which, if undetected, would be forwarded to the data collection point (i.e. the sink). Such attacks by compromised sensors can cause not only false alarms but also the depletion of the finite amount of energy in a battery powered network. We present a statistical en-route filtering (SEF) mechanism that can detect and drop such false reports. SEF requires that each sensing report be validated by multiple keyed message authentication codes (MACs), each generated by a node that detects the same event. As the report is forwarded, each node along the way verifies the correctness of the MACs probabilistically and drops those with invalid MACs at earliest points. The sink further filters out remaining false reports that escape the en-route filtering. SEF exploits the network scale to determine the truthfulness of each report through collective decision-making by multiple detecting nodes and collective false-report-detection by multiple forwarding nodes. Our analysis and simulations show that, with an overhead of 14 bytes per report, SEF is able to drop 80/spl sim/90% injected false reports by a compromised node within 10 forwarding hops, and reduce energy consumption by 50% or more in many cases.},

abstract={Many algorithms for routing in sensor networks exploit greedy forwarding strategies to get packets to their destinations.

We give a definition of stuck nodes where packets may get stuck in greedy multi-hop forwarding, and develop a local rule, the TENT rule, for each node in the network to test whether a packet can get stuck at that node. To help the packets get out of stuck nodes, we describe a distributed algorithm, BOUNDHOLE, to build routes around holes, which are connected regions of the network with boundaries consisting of all the stuck nodes. We show that these hole-surrounding routes can be used in many applications such as geographic routing, path migration, information storage mechanisms and identification of regions of interest.},

abstract={Applications that require good network performance often use parallel TCP streams and TCP modifications to improve the effectiveness of TCP. If the network bottleneck is fully utilized, this approach boosts throughput by unfairly stealing bandwidth from competing TCP streams. Improving the effectiveness of TCP is easy, but improving effectiveness while maintaining fairness is difficult. In this paper, we describe an approach we implemented that uses a long virtual round trip time in combination with parallel TCP streams to improve effectiveness on underutilized networks. Our approach prioritizes fairness at the expense of effectiveness when the network is fully utilized. We compared our approach with standard parallel TCP over a wide-area network, and found that our approach preserves effectiveness and is fairer to competing traffic than standard parallel TCP.},

We briefly demonstrate three well-known problems of the RFC2988-RTO. We then develop a new RTO algorithm called the peak-hopper-RTO (PH-RTO) that eliminates the mentioned problems. Through extensive simulations in ns2, we evaluate the effectiveness of both RTO algorithms. The key advantage of the PH-RTO over the RFC2988-RTO is its predictability. Although the RFC2988-RTO often exhibits low loss detection times, it also exhibits frequent "RTO outliers" that can lead to exceptionally long loss detection times. The loss detection times of the PH-RTO are much more closely spread around the mean. Finally, our results show that the PH-RTO is much more robust to sudden delay spikes that are particularly common in wireless networks.},

pages={2514-2524 vol.4},
abstract={High-speed networks with large delays present a unique environment where TCP may have a problem utilizing the full bandwidth. Several congestion control proposals have been suggested to remedy this problem. The existing protocols consider mainly two properties: TCP friendliness and bandwidth scalability. That is, a protocol should not take away too much bandwidth from standard TCP flows while utilizing the full bandwidth of high-speed networks. This work presents another important constraint, namely, RTT (round trip time) unfairness where competing flows with different RTTs may consume vastly unfair bandwidth shares. Existing schemes have a severe RTT unfairness problem because the congestion window increase rate gets larger as the window grows ironically the very reason that makes them more scalable. RTT unfairness for high-speed networks occurs distinctly with drop tail routers for flows with large congestion windows where packet loss can be highly synchronized. After identifying the RTT unfairness problem of existing protocols, This work presents a new congestion control scheme that alleviates RTT unfairness while supporting TCP friendliness and bandwidth scalability. The proposed congestion control algorithm uses two window size control policies called additive increase and binary search increase. When the congestion window is large, additive increase with a large increment ensures square RTT unfairness as well as good scalability. Under small congestion windows, binary search increase supports TCP friendliness. The simulation results confirm these properties of the protocol.},

abstract={In a wireless ad hoc network with multihop transmissions and interference-limited link rates, can we balance power control in the physical layer and congestion control in the transport layer to enhance the overall network performance, while maintaining the stability, robustness, and architectural modularity of the network? We present a distributive power control algorithm that couples with the original TCP protocols to increase the end-to-end throughput and energy efficiency of the network. Under the rigorous framework of nonlinearly constrained optimization, we prove the convergence of this coupled system to the global optimum of joint power control and congestion control, for both synchronized and asynchronous implementations. The rate of convergence is geometric and a desirable modularity between the transport and physical layers is maintained. In particular, when the congestion control mechanism is TCP Vegas, that a simple utilization in the physical layer of the router buffer occupancy information suffices to achieve the joint optimum of this cross layer design. Both analytic results and simulations illustrate other desirable properties of the proposed algorithm, including robustness to channel outage and to path loss estimation errors, and flexibility in trading-off performance optimality for implementation simplicity.},

abstract={Most researches in ad hoc networks focus on routing, and not much work has been done on data access. A common technique used to improve the performance of data access is caching. Cooperative caching, which allows the sharing and coordination of cached data among multiple nodes, can further explore the potential of the caching techniques. Due to mobility and resource constraints of ad hoc networks, cooperative caching techniques designed for wired network may not be applicable to ad hoc networks. In this paper, we design and evaluate cooperative caching techniques to efficiently support data access in ad hoc networks. We first propose two schemes: cachedata which caches the data, and cachepath which caches the data path. After analyzing the performance of those two schemes, we propose a hybrid approach (hybridcache) which can further improve the performance by taking advantage of cachedata and cachepath while avoiding their weaknesses. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the query delay and message complexity when compared to other caching schemes.},

abstract={This paper focuses on congestion control over multi-hop, wireless networks. In a wireless network, an important constraint that arises is that due to the MAC (media access control) layer. Many wireless MACs use a time-division strategy for channel access, where, at any point in space, the physical channel can be accessed by a single user at each instant of time. We develop a fair hop-by-hop congestion control algorithm with the MAC constraint being imposed in the form of a channel access time constraint, using an optimization based framework. In the absence of delay, we show that this algorithm is globally stable using a Lyapunov function based approach. Next, in the presence of delay, we show that the hop-by-hop control algorithm has the property of spatial spreading. In other words, focused loads at a particular spatial location in the network get "smoothed" over space. We derive bounds on the "peak load" at a node, both with hop-by-hop control, as well as with end-to-end control, show that significant gains are achieved with the hop-by-hop scheme, and validate the analytical results with simulation.},

abstract={We present a new medium access control (MAC) protocol for ad-hoc networks with multiple input multiple output (MIMO) links. Links that use multiple element arrays (MEAs) at both ends are referred to as MIMO links. MIMO links are known to provide extremely high spectral efficiencies in multipath channels by simultaneously transmitting multiple independent data streams in the same channel. MAC protocols have been proposed in related work for ad-hoc networks with other classes of smart antennas such as switched beam antennas. However, as we substantiate in the paper, the unique characteristics of MIMO links necessitate an entirely new MAC protocol. We identify several advantages of MIMO links, and discuss key optimization considerations that can help in realizing an effective MAC protocol for such an environment. We present a centralized algorithm that has the optimization considerations incorporated in its design. Finally, we present a distributed protocol that approximates the centralized algorithm, and compare its performance against that of baseline protocols that are variants of the CSMA/CA protocol.},

Two coding strategies are analyzed: a Slepian-Wolf model where optimal coding is complex and transmission optimization is simple, and a joint entropy coding model with explicit communication where coding is simple and transmission optimization is difficult. This problem requires a joint optimization of the rate allocation at the nodes and of the transmission structure. For the Slepian-Wolf setting, we derive a closed form solution and an efficient distributed approximation algorithm with a good performance. For the explicit communication case, we prove that building an optimal data gathering tree is NP-complete and we propose various distributed approximation algorithms.},

abstract={Providing real-time communication services to multimedia applications and subscription-based Internet access often requires sufficient network resources to be reserved for real-time traffic. However, the reserved network resource is susceptible to resource theft and abuse. Without a resource access control mechanism that can efficiently differentiate legitimate real-time traffic from attacking packets, the traffic conditioning and policing enforced at ISP (Internet service provider) edge routers cannot protect the reserved network resource from embezzlement. On the contrary, the traffic policing at edge routers aggravates their vulnerability to flooding attacks by blindly dropping packets. We propose a fast and light-weighted IP network-edge resource access control mechanism, called IP easy-pass to prevent unauthorized access to reserved network resources at edge devices. We attach a unique pass to each legitimate real-time packet so that an ISP edge router can validate the legitimacy of an incoming IP packet very quickly and simply by checking its pass. We present the generation of easy-pass, its embedding, and verification procedures. We implement the IP easy-pass mechanism in the Linux kernel, analyze its effectiveness against packet forgery and resource embezzlement attempts. Finally, we measure the overhead incurred by easy-pass.},

abstract={Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a critical threat to the Internet. Currently, most ISPs merely rely on manual detection of DDoS attacks after which offline fine-grain traffic analysis is performed and new filtering rules are installed manually to the routers. The need of human intervention results in poor response time and fails to protect the victim before severe damages are realized. The expressiveness of existing filtering rules is also too limited and rigid when compared to the ever-evolving characteristics of the attacking packets. Recently, we have proposed a DDoS defense architecture that supports distributed detection and automated on-line attack characterization. We focus on the design and evaluation of the automated attack characterization, selective packet discarding and overload control portion of the proposed architecture. Our key idea is to prioritize packets based on a per-packet score which estimates the legitimacy of a packet given the attribute values it carries. Special considerations are made to ensure that the scheme is amenable to high-speed hardware implementation. Once the score of a packet is computed, we perform score-based selective packet discarding where the dropping threshold is dynamically adjusted based on (1) the score distribution of recent incoming packets and (2) the current level of overload of the system.},

abstract={Firewalls are core elements in network security. However, managing firewall rules, particularly in multi-firewall enterprise networks, has become a complex and error-prone task. Firewall filtering rules have to be written, ordered and distributed carefully in order to avoid firewall policy anomalies that might cause network vulnerability. Therefore, inserting or modifying filtering rules in any firewall requires thorough intra- and inter-firewall analysis to determine the proper rule placement and ordering in the firewalls. We identify all anomalies that could exist in a single- or multi-firewall environment. We also present a set of techniques and algorithms to automatically discover policy anomalies in centralized and distributed legacy firewalls. These techniques are implemented in a software tool called the "Firewall Policy Advisor" that simplifies the management of filtering rules and maintains the security of next-generation firewalls.},

abstract={Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become widely recognized as powerful tools for identifying, deterring and deflecting malicious attacks over the network. Essential to almost every intrusion detection system is the ability to search through packets and identify content that matches known attacks. Space and time efficient string matching algorithms are therefore important for identifying these packets at line rate. We examine string matching algorithms and their use for intrusion detection, in particular, we focus our efforts on providing worst-case performance that is amenable to hardware implementation. We contribute modifications to the Aho-Corasick string-matching algorithm that drastically reduce the amount of memory required and improve its performance on hardware implementations. We also show that these modifications do not drastically affect software performance on commodity processors, and therefore may be worth considering in these cases as well.},

abstract={It is often useful to know the geographic positions of nodes in a communications network, but adding GPS receivers or other sophisticated sensors to every node can be expensive. MDS-MAP is a recent localization method based on multidimensional scaling (MDS). It uses connectivity information - who is within communications range of whom - to derive the locations of the nodes in the network, and can take advantage of additional data, such as estimated distances between neighbors or known positions for certain anchor nodes, if they are available. However, MDS-MAP is an inherently centralized algorithm and is therefore of limited utility in many applications. In this paper, we present a new variant of the MDS-MAP method, which we call MDS-MAP(P) standing for MDS-MAP using patches of relative maps, that can be executed in a distributed fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that the new algorithm not only preserves the good performance of the original method on relatively uniform layouts, but also performs much better than the original on irregularly-shaped networks. The main idea is to build a local map at each node of the immediate vicinity and then merge these maps together to form a global map. This approach works much better for topologies in which the shortest path distance between two nodes does not correspond well to their Euclidean distance. We also discuss an optional refinement step that improves solution quality even further at the expense of additional computation.},

abstract={Sensor Positioning is a fundamental and crucial issue for sensor network operation and management. In the paper, we first study some situations where most existing sensor positioning methods tend to fail to perform well, an example being when the topology of a sensor network is anisotropic. Then, we explore the idea of using dimensionality reduction techniques to estimate sensors coordinates in two (or three) dimensional space, and we propose a distributed sensor positioning method based on multidimensional scaling technique to deal with these challenging conditions. Multidimensional scaling and coordinate alignment techniques are applied to recover positions of adjacent sensors. The estimated positions of the anchors are compared with their true physical positions and corrected. The positions of other sensors are corrected accordingly. With iterative adjustment, our method can overcome adverse network and terrain conditions, and generate accurate sensor position. We also propose an on demand sensor positioning method based on the above method.},

abstract={Ad-hoc localization systems enable nodes in a sensor network to fix their positions in a global coordinate system using a relatively small number of anchor nodes that know their position through external means (e.g., GPS). Because location information provides context to sensed data, such systems are a critical component of many sensor networks and have therefore received a fair amount of recent attention in the sensor networks literature. The efficacy of these systems is a function of the density of deployment and of anchor nodes, as well as the error in distance estimation (ranging) between nodes. In this paper, we examine how these factors impact the performance of the system. This examination lays the groundwork for the main question we consider in this paper: Can the ability to estimate bearing to neighboring nodes greatly increase the performance of ad-hoc localization systems? We discuss the design of ad-hoc localization systems that use range together with either bearing or imprecise bearing (such as sectoring) information, and evaluate these systems using analysis and simulation.},

year={2004},
volume={4},

pages={2685-2696 vol.4},
abstract={We present a novel time-based positioning scheme (TPS) for efficient location discovery in outdoor sensor networks. TPS relies on TDoA (time-difference-of-arrival) of RF signals measured locally at a sensor to detect range differences from the sensor to three base stations. These range differences are averaged over multiple beacon intervals before they are combined to estimate the sensor location through trilateration. A nice feature of this positioning scheme is that it is purely localized: sensors independently compute their positions. We present a statistical analysis of the performance of TPS in noisy environments. We also identify possible sources of position errors with suggested measures to mitigate them. Our scheme requires no time synchronization in the network and minimal extra hardware in sensor construction. TPS induces no communication overhead for sensors, as they listen to three beacon signals passively during each beacon interval. The computation overhead is low, as the location detection algorithm involves only simple algebraic operations over scalar values. TPS is not adversely affected by increasing network size or density and thus offers scalability. We conduct extensive simulations to test the performance of TPS when TDoA measurement errors are normally distributed or uniformly distributed. The obtained results show that TPS is an effective scheme for outdoor sensor self-positioning.},

abstract={We investigate the problem of finding the minimum delay application-layer multicast trees, such as the trees constructed in overlay networks. It is accepted that shortest path trees are not a good solution for the problem since such trees can have nodes with very large degree, termed high load nodes. The load on these nodes makes them a bottleneck in the distribution tree, due to computation load and access link bandwidth constrains. Many previous solutions limited the maximal degree of the nodes by introducing arbitrary constraints. In this work, we show how to directly map the node load to the delay penalty at the application host, and create a new model that captures the trade offs between the desire to select shortest path trees and the need to constrain the load on the hosts. In this model the problem is shown to be NP-hard. Therefore, we present a logarithmic approximation algorithm and an alternative heuristic solution. Our heuristic algorithm is shown by simulations to be scalable for large group sizes, and produces results that are very close to optimal.},

pages={2708-2718 vol.4},
abstract={We consider the delivery of reliable and streaming services using application-level multicast (ALM) by means of UDP, where packet loss has to be recovered via retransmission in a timely manner in order to offer high level of service. Since packets may be lost due to congestion, tree-reconfiguration or node failure, the traditional "vertical" recovery, whereby upstream nodes retransmit the lost packet is no longer effective. We therefore propose and investigate lateral error recovery (LER). In LER, hosts are divided into a number of planes, each of which forms an independent ALM tree. Since the correlation of error among the planes is likely to be low, a node can effectively recover its error "laterally" from nearby nodes in other planes. We employ the technique of global network positioning (GNP) to map the hosts into a coordinate space and identify a set of close neighbors for error recovery by constructing a Voronoi diagram for each plane. We present centralized and distributed algorithm on how to construct the Voronoi diagrams. Using Internet-like topologies, we show via simulations that our system achieves low overheads in terms of relative delay penalty and physical link stress. For reliable service, lateral recovery greatly reduces the average recovery time as compared with vertical recovery schemes. For streaming applications, LER achieves much lower residual loss rate under a certain deadline constraint.},

abstract={We propose a new forwarding mechanism for IP multicast based on explicit multicast (Xcast). Compared with traditional IP multicast, our mechanism achieves a more flexible allocation of multicast forwarding states among routers. Previous works only focus on reducing the number of routers which store the forwarding states, ignoring the distribution of forwarding states among routers. The number of forwarding states stored in each router may be unbalanced. We formulate the assignment of the routers with forwarding states as two optimization problems. The first one is to minimize the number of routers with the forwarding states in each multicast tree. The second one is to minimize the maximum number of forwarding states stored in a router. We design several algorithms for both problems. We prove that our algorithms can find the optimal solution to the first problem. By simulation, we also show that our algorithms perform well in the second problem. Moreover, we prove that assigning all branching routers as the only routers with the forwarding states is a special case in our mechanism. Due to higher flexibility, we show that our mechanism use fewer forwarding states, and the distribution of forwarding states is more balanced.},

abstract={It has been widely recognized that physical layer impairments, including power losses, must be taken into account when routing optical connections in transparent networks. In this paper we study the problem of constructing light-trees under optical layer power budget constraints, with a focus on algorithms which can guarantee a certain level of quality for the signals received by the destination nodes. We define a new constrained light-tree routing problem by introducing a set of constraints on the source-destination paths to account for the power losses at the optical layer. We investigate a number of variants of this problem, we characterize their complexity, and we develop a suite of corresponding routing algorithms; one of the algorithms is appropriate for networks with sparse light splitting and/or limited splitting fanout. We find that, in order to guarantee an adequate signal quality and to scale to large destination sets, light-trees must be as balanced as possible. Numerical results demonstrate that existing algorithms tend to construct highly unbalanced trees, and are thus expected to perform poorly in an optical network setting. Our algorithms, on the other hand, are designed to construct balanced trees which, in addition to having good performance in terms of signal quality, they also ensure a certain degree of fairness among destination nodes. While we only consider power loss in this work, the algorithms we develop could be appropriately modified to account for other physical layer impairments, such as dispersion.},

title={A proactive approach to reconstructing overlay multicast trees},
year={2004},

pages={2743-2753 vol.4},
abstract={Overlay multicast constructs a multicast delivery tree among end hosts. Unlike traditional IP multicast, the non-leaf nodes in the tree are normal end hosts, which are potentially more susceptible to failures than routers and may leave the multicast group voluntarily. In these cases, all downstream nodes are affected. Thus an important problem in overlay multicast is how to recover from node departures in order to minimize the disruption of service to those affected nodes. In this paper, we propose a proactive approach to restore overlay multicast trees. Rather than letting downstream nodes try to find a new parent after a node departure, each non-leaf node pre-calculates a parent-to-be for each of its children. When this non-leaf node is gone, all its children can find their respective new parents immediately. The salient feature of the approach is that each non-leaf node can compute a rescue plan for its children independently, and in most cases, rescue plans from multiple non-leaf nodes can work together for their children when they fail or leave at the same time. We develop a protocol for nodes to communicate with new parents so that the delivery tree can be quickly restored. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proactive approach can recover from node departures 5 times faster than reactive methods in some cases, and 2 times faster on average.},

abstract={Guard channels have been proposed to minimize handoff call dropping when mobile hosts move from one cell to another. CDMA systems are power- and interference-limited. Therefore, guard capacity in CDMA networks is soft, that is, a given capacity corresponds to variable number of connections. Thus, it is essential to adjust the guard capacity in response to changes in traffic conditions and user mobility. We propose two schemes for managing downlink CDMA radio resources: guard capacity adaptation based on dropping (GAD), and guard capacity adaptation based on prediction and dropping (GAPD). In both schemes, the guard capacity of a cell is dynamically adjusted so as to maintain the handoff dropping rate at a target level. In the second scheme, there is an additional, frequent adjustment component where guard capacity is adjusted based on soft handoff prediction. We show through extensive simulations that GAD and GAPD control the handoff dropping rate effectively under varying traffic conditions and system parameters. We also find that GAPD is more robust than GAD to temporal traffic variations and changes in control parameters.},

abstract={In cellular networks, an important call-level quality-of-service (QoS) issue is how to limit the probability of forced termination during handoffs. One solution is to predict the trajectory of mobile terminals so as to perform bandwidth reservation in advance. With the vision that future mobile devices are likely equipped with reasonably accurate positioning capability, we propose a novel mobility prediction technique that incorporates both mobile positioning information and road topology knowledge. We then develop an adaptive bandwidth reservation scheme that dynamically adjusts the reservation at each base station according to both incoming and outgoing hand-off predictions generated using our mobility prediction technique. We evaluate the performance of the scheme via simulations, along with six other schemes for comparison purposes. Results agree with intuition that schemes which incorporate more knowledge are able to achieve better reservation efficiency. Our scheme is shown to achieve the best efficiency among all realizable schemes simulated.},

abstract={We compare the performance of two multiple antenna systems to be used in quality of service (QoS) supported indoor wireless networks. While a conventional array antenna system (AAS) has collocated, closely spaced antenna elements, a distributed antenna system (DAS) has largely spaced antennas over the entire area of radio coverage. To support multimedia applications requiring high bandwidth and on time delivery, we propose a set of highly spectrum efficient radio resource management algorithms. We focus on the optimization of downlink since many kinds of Internet traffic show the downlink dominance in their traffic asymmetry. To maximize the downlink throughput, we present a new transmit beamforming algorithm which can be equally applied to both DAS and AAS. The beamforming algorithm is integrated with a link scheduling algorithm that exploits the space division multiplexing (SDM) capability of multiple antenna systems to meet the QoS requirements of all terminals. Numerical examples conducted for a line of sight (LOS) environment demonstrate that a network with DAS outperforms one with AAS in terms of signal coverage and provides 40-160% higher capacity.},

abstract={We investigate the problem of efficient resource control for loss-sensitive traffic in CDMA networks, using an economic modelling framework that takes into account the joint control of the transmission rate and the signal quality. Although the corresponding global optimization problem has a non-trivial structure, and we cannot in general guarantee that a solution can be found using the Lagrangian method, we have strong experimental evidence that this is possible for a wide range of user utilities. In this case the global optimum can be achieved in a decentralized manner, using shadow prices to influence the individual user resource requests. Based on this evidence, the main contribution of the paper is to discuss how existing rate control and outer-loop power control procedures can obtain a simple and attractive form that takes into account, through shadow prices, the level of demand and supply in order to achieve efficient resource utilization. Moreover, we describe and evaluate approximations of the proposed resource control model that can simplify its application, and we present extensions of the model for the case where the packet success ratio depends on the transmission rate in addition to the signal quality, and for network paths containing multiple wireless links.},

pages={2800-2811 vol.4},
abstract={In wireless cellular networks and wireless local area networks, nonlinear network utility maximization need to be conducted over both user rates and transmit powers. For each of the three cases considered in this paper, we present an algorithm that converges to the jointly optimal pair of rate vector and power vector. For the simple case when data rates are not limited by interferences, for example in single-cell downlink transmissions, we propose algorithm 1, which is an iterative bidding mechanism between the base station and mobile users, where knowledge about channel conditions and individual user utility functions is only needed locally at each user but not needed at the base station. In the case when data rates are limited by interferences, the utility maximization problem is complicated both by nonlinear coupling between powers and rates, and by interference among powers. Through centralized iterative steps, we propose algorithm 2, which converges to a joint and global optimum over the solution space of rates and powers. We then consider end-to-end transmissions in cellular networks, which traverse both wireless fading channels and many hops of wired links shared by other traffic. There is a tradeoff between attaining air-interface capacity in the wireless hop and controlling congestion in the wired backbone wide area network. We formulate this end-to-end resource allocation problem in such hybrid networks, and present a solution to obtain the Pareto optimal tradeoff between attaining wireless multi-access fading channel capacity and maximizing global network utility.},

pages={2812-2820 vol.4},
abstract={AIMD is a widely-used network congestion control scheme. Despite its discontinuous control behavior, the majority of contemporary literature employed a statistically-averaged continuous model to approximate AIMD without considering its discontinuity. The design of a discontinuous control system must be based on rules that are entirely different from that of continuous control systems. Ignoring discontinuity issues results in great discrepancy between analytical models and the practice. In this paper we use the sliding mode control (SMC) theory to investigate congestion control without ignoring its discontinuity. Based on the SMC theory, the design of discontinuous (congestion) control systems must consider the relative degree and zero dynamics of the system, in order to guarantee asymptotic stability. This framework can precisely reflect the behavior of the control rules and the controlled objective of a congestion control system. We show that the relative degree of the control system of rate-based, AIMD flow-control algorithms is two. That is, to apply sound control principles to the design of AIMD algorithms, one should use both the queue length error and its first order time derivative to construct the switching function of the control model of an active queue management scheme. Based on the SMC model, one can quantify the tradeoffs among the convergence speed, the amount of throttling adjustments, and the degree of oscillations. We show quantitatively that one can guarantee stability conditions, drastically reduce oscillation of AIMD without significant loss of fairness and stability, and quantitative understanding of the tradeoffs among oscillation, delay and fairness.},

abstract={Fluid models of IP networks have been recently proposed as a way to break the scalability barrier of traditional discrete state-space models, both simulative (e.g., ns-2) and analytical (e.g., queues and Markov chains). Fluid models adopt an abstract deterministic description of the average network dynamics through a set of ordinary differential equations that are then solved numerically, obtaining estimates of the time-dependent network behavior. However, an important limit of the fluid model approaches presented so far in the literature is their unnatural representation of scenarios comprising the short-lived TCP flows that dominate in today's Internet. In this paper we propose a new fluid model approach in which a different description of the dynamics of traffic sources is adopted, exploiting partial differential equations. This new description of the source dynamics allows the natural representation of short-lived as well as long-lived TCP connections, with little sacrifice in the scalability of the model. In addition, the use of partial differential equations permits the description of distributions, instead of averages, thus providing better accuracy in the results. The comparison between the performance estimates obtained with fluid models and with ns simulations proves the accuracy of the proposed modeling approach.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the performance of a large population of long lived TCP flows experiencing random packet losses due to both random transmission errors and congestion created by the sharing of a common tail drop bottleneck router. We propose a natural and simple model for the joint throughput evolution of the set of TCP sessions under such a mix of losses. For the case of Poisson transmission errors, we show that the asymptotic model where the population tends to infinity leads to a well defined and tractable dynamical system. In particular, we get the mean value of the throughput of each session as a function of the transmission error rate and the synchronization rate in the bottleneck router. The large population asymptotic model has two interesting and non-intuitive properties: 1) there exists a positive threshold (given in closed form) on the transmission error rate above which there are no congestion losses at all in steady state; 2) below this threshold, the mean throughput of each flow is an increasing function of the transmission error rate, so that the maximum mean value is in fact achieved when the transmission error rate is equal to this threshold. The finite population model and models based on other classes of point processes are also studied. In particular, a sufficient condition is obtained for the existence of congestion times in the case of arbitrary transmission error point processes.},

abstract={In this paper, we examine the feasibility of incorporating network calculus based models in simulating TCP/IP networks. By exploiting network calculus properties, we characterize how TCP congestion control - additive increase and multiplicative decrease (AIMD), together with the queue management strategy used in routers, regulates TCP flows. We first divide the time axis into intervals (each of which consists of multiple round-trip times), and derive a TCP AIMD throughput model which derives the attainable throughput of a TCP flow, given the number of collisions in an interval. Then based on the derived throughput model, we define a set of network calculus based theorems that give upper and lower bounds on the attainable TCP throughput in each interval. Finally, we implement network calculus (NC) based simulation in ns-2, conduct simulation in both the packet mode and the network calculus-based mode, and measure the performance gain (in terms of the execution time thus reduced) and the error discrepancy (in terms of the discrepancy between NC-based simulation results and packet-level simulation results). The simulation results indicate an order of magnitude or more (maximally 30 times) improvement in execution time and the performance improvement becomes more pronounced as the network size increases (in perspective of network capacities and number of flows). The error discrepancy between NC-based simulation and packet-level simulation, on the other hand, is minimally 1-2% and maximally 8-12% in a wide spectrum of network topologies and traffic loads employed in this study. The simulation results also indicate the superiority of NC-based simulation over fluid model based simulation (the latter realized using the time stepped hybrid simulation).},

abstract={Fluid models have been shown to he efficient and accurate in modelling large IP networks. However, unlike packet models, it is difficult to extract packet-level information from them. In this paper, we present a hybrid simulation method that maintains the performance advantage of fluid models while providing detailed packet level information for selected packet traffic flows. We propose two models to account for the interaction between background TCP traffic in a fluid network and foreground packet traffic of interest. The first assumes that the packet traffic poses a negligible load on the fluid network whereas the second accounts for the added load by transforming the packet traffic into fluid flows and solving the resulting enhanced fluid model. The first of these yields an efficient one pass solution algorithm whereas the second requires an additional pass to account for the packet traffic load. We establish the correctness of both approaches and present their implementation within ns-2. Comparisons between the hybrid models and a classical packet simulation show the two pass approach to be quite accurate and computationally efficient.},

In the context of the unified framework, we study both the case of a channel with perfect state information and the case of a channel with imperfect state information (delayed or lost feedback). We adapt the theory of infinite-horizon, average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) with average-cost constraints to the problem. Based on simulations with MPEG-4 FGS video, we show that (1) optimizing together scheduling, FEC error correction and error concealment improves performance significantly and (2) policies with static error protection give near-optimal performance. We also find that degradations in quality for a channel with imperfect state information are small; thus our MDP approach is suitable for networks with long end-to-end delays},

abstract={Caching video objects at proxies close to clients has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. To meet diverse client bandwidth conditions, there have been research efforts to combine proxy caching with video layering or transcoding. Nevertheless, these adaptive systems suffer from either coarse adaptation granularity due to the inflexible structures of existing layered coders or high computation overhead due to the transcoding operations. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive video caching framework that enables low-cost and fine-grained adaptation. The innovative approach employs the MPEG-4 fine-grained scalable (FGS) video with postencoding rate control. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is both network aware and media adaptive: clients can be of heterogeneous streaming rates, and the backbone bandwidth consumption can be adaptively controlled. We also examine the design and management issues in the framework, in particular, the optimal stream portions to cache and the optimal streaming rate to each client. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to nonadaptive caching, the proposed framework with optimal cache management not only achieves significant reduction on transmission costs but also enables flexible utility assignment for the heterogeneous clients. Meanwhile, its computational overhead is kept at a low level, implying that it is practically deployable},

abstract={We consider the problem of how to enable the streaming of live video content from a single server to a large number of clients. One recently proposed approach relies on the cooperation of the video clients in forming an application layer multicast tree over which the video is propagated. Video continuity is maintained as client departures disrupt the multicast tree, using multiple description coded (MDC) streams multicast over several application layer trees. While this maintains continuity, it can cause video quality fluctuation as clients depart and trees are reconstructed around them. In this paper we develop a scheme using the transmission of a single-description coded video over an application layer multicast tree formed by cooperative clients. Video continuity is maintained in spite of tree disruption caused by departing clients using a combination of two techniques: 1) providing time-shifted streams at the server and allowing clients that suffer service disconnection to join a video channel of the time-shifted stream, and 2) using video patching to allow a client to catch up with the progress of a video program. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our design can achieve uninterrupted service, while not compromising the video quality, at moderate cost},

abstract={Researchers often use segment-based proxy caching strategies to deliver streaming media by partially caching media objects. The existing strategies mainly consider increasing the byte hit ratio and/or reducing the client perceived startup latency (denoted by the metric delayed startup ratio). However, these efforts do not guarantee continuous media delivery because the to-be-viewed object segments may not be cached in the proxy when they are demanded. The potential consequence is playback jitter at the client side due to proxy delay in fetching the uncached segments, which we call proxy jitter. Thus, for the best interests of clients, a correct model for streaming proxy system design should aim to minimize proxy jitter subject to reducing the delayed startup ratio and increasing the byte hit ratio. However, we have observed two major pairs of conflicting interests inherent in this model: (1) one between improving the byte hit ratio and reducing proxy jitter, and (2) the other between improving the byte hit ratio and reducing the delayed startup ratio. In this study, we first propose an active prefetching method for in-time prefetching of uncached segments, which provides insights into the first pair of conflicting interests. Second, we further improve our lazy-segmentation scheme which effectively addresses the second pair of the conflicting interests. Finally, considering our main objective of minimizing proxy jitter and optimizing the two trade-offs, we propose a new streaming proxy system called Hyper Proxy by effectively coordinating both prefetching and segmentation techniques. Synthetic and real workloads are used to systematically evaluate our system. The performance results show that the hyper proxy system generates minimum proxy jitter with a low delayed startup ratio and a small decrease of byte hit ratio compared with existing schemes},

abstract={A conventional video file contains a single temporally-ordered sequence of video frames. Clients requesting on-demand streaming of such a file receive (all or intervals of) the same content. For popular tiles that receive many requests during a file playback time, scalable streaming protocols based on multicast or broadcast have been devised. Such protocols require server and network bandwidth that grow much slower than linearly with the file request rate. This paper considers "nonlinear" video content in which there are parallel sequences of frames. Clients dynamically select which branch of the video they wish to follow, sufficiently ahead of each branch point so as to allow the video to he delivered without jitter. An example might be "choose-your-own-ending" movies. With traditional scalable delivery architectures such as movie theaters or TV broadcasting, such personalization of the delivered video content is very difficult or impossible. It becomes feasible, in principle at least, when the video is streamed to individual clients over a network. This paper analyzes the minimal server bandwidth requirements, and proposes and evaluates practical scalable delivery protocols, for on-demand streaming of nonlinear media},

An important problem is to provide network managers with information about changes in traffic, informing them about "what's new". Specifically, we focus on the challenge of finding significantly large differences in traffic: over time, between interfaces and between routers. We introduce the idea of a deltoid: an item that has a large difference, whether the difference is absolute, relative or variational. We present novel algorithms for finding the most significant deltoids in high speed traffic data, and prove that they use small space, very small time per update, and are guaranteed to find significant deltoids with prespecified accuracy. In experimental evaluation with real network traffic, our algorithms perform well and recover almost all deltoids.

abstract={Since the identification of long-range dependence in network traffic ten years ago, its consistent appearance across numerous measurement studies has largely discredited Poisson-based models. However, since that original data set was collected, both link speeds and the number of Internet-connected hosts have increased by more than three orders of magnitude. Thus, we now revisit the Poisson assumption, by studying a combination of historical traces and new measurements obtained from a major backbone link belonging to a Tier 1 ISP. We show that unlike the older data sets, current network traffic can be well represented by the Poisson model for sub-second time scales. At multisecond scales, we find a distinctive piecewise-linear nonstationarity, together with evidence of long-range dependence. Combining our observations across both time scales leads to a time-dependent Poisson characterization of network traffic that, when viewed across very long time scales, exhibits the observed long-range dependence. This traffic characterization reconciliates the seemingly contradicting observations of Poisson and long-memory traffic characteristics. It also seems to be in general agreement with recent theoretical models for large-scale traffic aggregation},

abstract={We define and evaluate methods to perform robust network monitoring using trajectory sampling in the presence of report loss. The first challenge is to reconstruct an unambiguous set of packet trajectories from the reports on sampled packets received at a collector. In this paper we extend the reporting paradigm of trajectory sampling to enable the elimination of ambiguous groups of reports, but without introducing bias into any characterization of traffic based on the surviving reports. Even after the elimination, a proportion of trajectories are incomplete due to report loss. A second challenge is to adapt measurement based applications (including network engineering, path tracing, and passive performance measurement) to incomplete trajectories. To achieve this, we propose a method to join multiple incomplete trajectories for inference, and analyze its performance. We also show how applications can distinguish between packet and report loss at the statistical level},

Together, these variables provide a valuable diagnostic of end-user-perceived network performance. Our methodology is validated via both simulation and concurrent active measurements, and is shown to be able to handle various flavors of TCP. Given our passive approach and measurement points within a Tier-1 network provider, we are able to analyze more than 10 million connections, with senders located in more than 45% of the autonomous systems in today's Internet.

abstract={The performance of global Internet communication is significantly influenced by the reliability and the stability of Internet routing systems, especially the border gateway protocol (BGP), the de facto standard for inter-domain routing. In this paper, we investigate the reliability of BGP sessions and the internal BGP (IBGP) networks in the environment of unreliable physical and routing layers. The reliability analysis of IBGP networks is difficult, because IBGP sessions may be correlated to each other by the shared underlying physical links and TCP enables IBGP sessions to tolerate certain level of network failures. In this paper, we first investigate the failure probability of IBGP sessions and its relation to BGP timers and TCP retransmission behaviors. The result of this investigation is a simple modification of TCP that increases the robustness of IBGP sessions significantly. Second, we present a novel reliability model to measure the resilience of the whole IBGP networks. This model is of great importance for studying the function loss of IBGP operations and it also provides the theory basis for IBGP network optimization in terms of reliability},

year={2004},
volume={3},

pages={1605-1615 vol.3},
abstract={Traceroute is used heavily by network operators and researchers to identify the IP forwarding path from a source to a destination. In practice, knowing the autonomous system (AS) associated with each hop in the path is also quite valuable. In previous work we showed that the IP-to-AS mapping extracted from BGP routing tables is not sufficient for determining the AS-level forwarding paths. By comparing BGP and traceroute AS paths from multiple vantage points, Z. Morley Mao et al. (2003) proposed heuristics that identify the root causes of the mismatches and fix the inaccurate IP-to-AS mappings. These heuristics, though effective, are labor-intensive and mostly ad hoc. This paper proposes a systematic way to construct accurate IP-to-AS mappings using dynamic programming and iterative improvement. Our algorithm reduces the initial mismatch ratio of 15% between BGP and traceroute AS paths to 5% while changing only 2.9% of the assignments in the initial IP-to-AS mappings. This is in contrast to the results of Z. Morley Mao et al. (2003), where 10% of the assignments were modified and the mismatch ratio was only reduced to 9%. We show that our algorithm is robust and can yield near-optimal results even when the initial mapping is corrupted or when the number of probing sources or destinations is reduced. Our work is a key step towards building a scalable and accurate AS-level traceroute tool},

abstract={Capturing a precise snapshot of the Internet's topology is nearly impossible. Recent efforts have produced autonomous-system (AS) level topologies with noticeably divergent characteristics, even calling into question the widespread belief that the Internet's degree distribution follows a power law. In turn, this casts doubt on Internet modeling efforts, since validating a model on one data set does little to ensure validity on another data set, or on the (unknown) actual Internet topology. We examine six metrics-three existing metrics and three of our own-applied to two large publicly-available topology data sets. Certain metrics highlight differences between the two topologies, while one of our static metrics and several dynamic metrics display an invariance between the data sets. Invariant metrics may capture properties inherent to the Internet and independent of measurement methodology, and so may serve as better gauges for validating models. We continue by testing nine models-seven existing models and two of our own-according to these metrics applied to the two data sets. We distinguish between growth models that explicitly add nodes and links over time in a dynamic process, and static models that add all nodes and links in a batch process. All existing growth models show poor performance according to at least one metric, and only one existing static model, called Inet, matches all metrics well. Our two new models-growth models that are modest extensions of one of the simplest existing growth models-perform better than any other growth model across all metrics. Compared with Inet, our models are very simple. As growth models, they provide a possible explanation for the processes underlying the Internet's growth, explaining, for example, why the Internet's degree distribution is more skewed than baseline models would predict},

abstract={The problem of identifying topology and inferring link-level performance parameters such as packet drop rate or delay variance using only end-to-end measurements is commonly referred to as network tomography. This paper describes a collaborative framework for performing network tomography on topologies with multiple sources and multiple destinations, without assuming the topology to be known. Using multiple sources potentially provides a more accurate and refined characterization of the internal network. We present a novel multiple source active measurement procedure using a semirandomized probing scheme and packet arrival order measurements which do not require precise synchronization between the participating hosts. A decision-theoretic framework is developed enabling the joint characterization of topology and internal performance. We design a statistical test based on the generalized likelihood ratio test and Wilks' theorem. The test quantifies the tradeoff between network topology complexity and performance estimation, and identifies when measurements made by the two sources can be combined to achieve reduced variance performance estimates. The performance and efficacy of the algorithm are assessed through ns-2 simulations and experiments over the Internet},

abstract={The robustness of the Internet relies heavily on the robustness of BGP routing. BGP is the glue that holds the Internet together: it is the common language of the routers that interconnect networks or autonomous systems (AS). The robustness of BGP and our ability to manage it effectively is hampered by the limited global knowledge and lack of coordination between autonomous systems. One of the few efforts to develop a globally analyzable and secure Internet is the creation of the Internet routing registries (IRRs). IRRs provide a voluntary detailed repository of BGP policy information. The IRR effort has not reached its full potential because of two reasons: a) extracting useful information is far from trivial, and b) its accuracy of the data is uncertain. In this paper, we develop a methodology and a tool (Nemecis) to extract and infer information from IRR and validate it against BGP routing tables. In addition, using our tool, we quantify the accuracy of the information of IRR. We find that IRR has a lot of inaccuracies, but also contains significant and unique information. Finally, we show that our tool can identify and extract the correct information from IRR discarding erroneous data. In conclusion, our methodology and tool close the gap in the IRR vision for an analyzable Internet repository at the BGP level},

abstract={In this paper, we develop medium access control protocols to enable users in a wireless network to opportunistically transmit when they have favorable channel conditions, without requiring a centralized scheduler. We consider approaches that use splitting algorithms to resolve collisions over a sequence of minislots, and determine the user with the best channel. First, we present a basic algorithm for a system with i.i.d. block fading and a fixed number of backlogged users. We give an analysis of the throughput of this system and show that the average number of minislots required to find the user with the best channel is less than 2.5 independent of the number of users or the fading distribution. We then extend this algorithm to a channel with memory and also develop a reservation based scheme that offers improved performance as the channel memory increases. Finally we consider a model with random arrivals and propose a modified algorithm for this case. Simulation results are given to illustrate the performance in each of these settings},

abstract={We study the downlink scheduling problem in a cellular wireless network. The base stations are equipped with antenna arrays and can transmit to more than one mobile user at any time instant, provided the users are spatially separable. In previous work, an infinite traffic demand model is used to study the physical layer beamforming and power control algorithms that maximize the system throughput. In this paper we consider finite user traffic demands. A scheduling policy makes a decision based on both the queue lengths and the spatial separability of the users. The objective of the scheduling algorithm is to maintain the stability of the system. We derive an optimal scheduling policy that maintains the stability of the system if it is stable under any scheduling policy. However, this optimal scheduling policy is exponentially complex in the number of users which renders it impractical. We propose four heuristic scheduling algorithms that have polynomial complexity. The first two algorithms are for the special case of single cell systems, while the other two algorithms deal with multiple cell systems. Using a realistic multipath wireless channel model, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through computer simulations. The results demonstrate the benefits of joint consideration of queue length and dynamic base station assignment},

abstract={We consider a wireless basestation transmitting high-speed data to multiple mobile users in a cell. The channel conditions between the basestation and the users are time-varying and user-dependent. We wish to define which user to schedule at each time step. Previous work on this problem has typically assumed that the channel conditions are governed by a stationary stochastic process. In this setting a popular algorithm known as Max-Weight has been shown to have good performance. However, the stationarity assumption is not always reasonable. In this paper we study a more general worst-case model in which the channel conditions are governed by an adversary and are not necessarily stationary. In this model, we show that the nonstationarities can cause Max-Weight to have extremely poor performance. In particular, even if the set of possible transmission rates is finite, as in the CDMA 1timesEV-DO system, Max-Weight can produce queues size that are exponential in the number of users. On the positive side, we describe a set of tracking algorithms that aim to track the performance of a schedule maintained by the adversary. For one of these tracking algorithms the queue sizes are only quadratic. We discuss a number of practical issues associated with the tracking algorithms. We also illustrate the performance of Max-Weight and the tracking algorithms using simulation},

year={2004},

pages={1705-1716 vol.3},
abstract={Since sensor networks can be composed of a very large number of nodes, the developed protocols for these networks must be scalable. Moreover, these protocols must be designed to prolong the battery lifetime of the nodes. Typical existing routing techniques for ad hoc networks are known not to scale well. On the other hand, the so-called geographical routing algorithms are known to be scalable but their energy efficiency has never been extensively and comparatively studied. For this reason, a novel analytical framework is introduced. In a geographical routing algorithm, the packets are forwarded by a node to its neighbor based on their respective positions. The proposed framework allows to analyze the relationship between the energy efficiency of the routing tasks and the extension of the range of the topology knowledge for each node. The leading forwarding rules for geographical routing are compared in this framework, and the energy efficiency of each of them is studied. Moreover partial topology knowledge forwarding, a new forwarding scheme, is introduced. A wider topology knowledge can improve the energy efficiency of the routing tasks but can increase the cost of topology information due to signaling packets that each node must transmit and receive to acquire this information, especially in networks with high mobility. The problem of determining the optimal knowledge range for each node to make energy efficient geographical routing decisions is tackled by integer linear programming. It is demonstrated that the problem is intrinsically localized, i.e., a limited knowledge of the topology is sufficient to take energy efficient forwarding decisions, and that the proposed forwarding scheme outperforms the others in typical application scenarios. For online solution of the problem, a probe-based distributed protocol which allows each node to efficiently select its topology knowledge, is introduced and shown to converge to a near-optimal solution very fast},

abstract={We examine the problem of maximizing data collection from an energy-limited store-and-extract wireless sensor network, which is analogous to the maximum lifetime problem of interest in continuous data-gathering sensor networks. One significant difference is that this problem requires attention to "data-awareness" in addition to "energy-awareness." We formulate the maximum data extraction problem as a linear program and present a 1+omega iterative approximation algorithm for it. As a practical distributed implementation we develop a faster greedy heuristic for this problem that uses an exponential metric based on the approximation algorithm. We then show through simulation results that the greedy heuristic incorporating this exponential metric performs near-optimally (within 1 to 20% of optimal, with low overhead) and significantly better than other shortest-path routing approaches, particularly when nodes are heterogeneous in their energy and data availability},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks are considered the sensing technology of the future. Large numbers of untethered sensor nodes can be used for tracking small animals and targets, environmental monitoring, enforcing security perimeters, etc. A major problem for many sensor network applications is determining the most efficient way of conserving the energy of the power source. Some networks use batteries, while others suggest different methods of gathering energy (e.g., solar cells). Regardless of the powering method, energy conservation is of prime importance for sensor networks. The best way to conserve energy is to turn the sensor nodes off; however, since an inactive sensor node is no longer part of the network, the network can become disconnected. This creates a fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we propose a deterministic, schedule-based energy conservation scheme. In the proposed approach, time-synchronized sensors form on-off schedules that enable the sensors to be awake only when necessary. The schedule establishment is fully distributed and thus appropriate for large sensor networks. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through the use of simulations},

abstract={For energy-constrained stationary wireless networks of sensors, selection of links with high quality rate helps to ensure reliable long-term operation. During the implementation of a protocol targeting industrial applications of such systems, it was found that it is advantageous to acquire accurate information about the availability and quality of the RF communication links prior to the network topology formation. "Link assessment" as part of the initialization process, accomplishes this task by assessing a sufficient number of packets exchanged between neighboring nodes. This paper introduces and analyzes two different approaches to link assessment: The first approach is a random nondeterministic scheme that allows for a probabilistic guarantee of collision-free packet exchange. An alternative method is described which employs 'constant-weight codes' and provides a deterministic guarantee of success. In particular, a special class of constant-weight codes, known as optical orthogonal codes, are considered. Since, these codes are cyclically permutable, they make the link assessment process simpler, and therefore they are preferred over other codes. We evaluate the performance of these methods based on their energy consumption, time duration, and implementation complexity},

abstract={Per-flow traffic measurement is critical for usage accounting, traffic engineering, and anomaly detection. Previous methodologies are either based on random sampling (e.g., Cisco's NetFlow), which is inaccurate, or only account for the "elephants". We introduce a novel technique for measuring per-flow traffic approximately, for all flows regardless of their sizes, at very high-speed (say, OC768). The core of this technique is a novel data structure called space code bloom filter (SCBF). A SCBF is an approximate representation of a multiset; each element in this multiset is a traffic flow and its multiplicity is the number of packets in the flow. The multiplicity of an element in the multiset represented by SCBF can be estimated through either of two mechanisms-maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or mean value estimation (MVE). Through parameter tuning, SCBF allows for graceful tradeoff between measurement accuracy and computational and storage complexity. SCBF also contributes to the foundation of data streaming by introducing a new paradigm called blind streaming. We evaluate the performance of SCBF through mathematical analysis and through experiments on packet traces gathered from a tier-1 ISP backbone. Our results demonstrate that SCBF achieves reasonable measurement accuracy with very low storage and computational complexity},

abstract={Estimating end-to-end packet loss on Internet paths is important not only to monitor network performance, but also to assist adaptive applications make the best possible use of available network resources. There has been significant prior work on measuring and modeling packet loss in the Internet, but most of those techniques do not focus on providing real-time information and on assessing path performance from an application standpoint. In this paper, we present an online probing-based approach to estimate the loss performance of a network path, and extend this estimate to infer the performance that an application using the path would see. The approach relies on a hidden Markov model constructed from performance estimates generated from probes, which is then used to predict path performance as an application would experience. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using a number of different metrics, including loss rate and loss burstiness. The sensitivity of the results to measurement and computational overhead is also investigated, and an extension of the base approach using a layered model is explored as a possible solution to capturing time-varying channel behavior while keeping computational complexity reasonably low. The results we present show that the approach is capable of generating accurate, real-time estimates of path performance, and of predicting the performance that applications would experience if routed on the path},

abstract={We propose an adaptive bandwidth provisioning mechanism based on packet-level measurements (done at discrete time intervals) without any assumption on the statistical property of the traffic. Our approach consists of two stages: traffic forecasting, followed by bandwidth estimation. For the first stage, we have developed a probability-hop forecasting algorithm (based on ARIMA model) to forecast traffic based on online traffic measurements in a temporal management information base framework. For the second stage, we present several bandwidth provisioning schemes that allocate or deallocate bandwidth depending on the traffic forecast generated by our forecasting algorithm. We have introduced an utility function (along with other measures) to evaluate the overall effectiveness of our bandwidth provisioning framework. Through the use of real-world data, we have found that our approach works well for highly fluctuating data},

pages={1797-1807 vol.3},
abstract={In this paper we perform a detailed analysis of point-to-point packet delay in an operational tier-1 network. The point-to-point delay is the time between a packet entering a router in one PoP (an ingress point) and its leaving a router in another PoP (an egress point). It measures the one-way delay experienced by packets from an ingress point to an egress point across an ISP's network and provides the most basic information regarding the delay performance of the ISP's network. Using packet traces captured in the operational network, we obtain precise point-to-point packet delay measurements and analyze the various factors affecting them. Through a simple, step-by-step, systematic methodology and careful data analysis, we identify the major network factors that contribute to point-to-point packet delay and characterize their effect on the network delay performance. Our findings are: 1) delay distributions vary greatly in shape, depending on the path and link utilization; 2) after constant factors dependent only on the path and packet size are removed, the 99th percentile variable delay remains under 1 ms over several hops and under link utilization below 90% on a bottleneck; 3) a very small number of packets experience very large delay in short bursts},

abstract={Per-flow network traffic measurements are needed for effective network traffic management, network performance assessment, and detection of anomalous network events such as incipient DoS attacks. Explicit measurement of per-flow traffic statistics is difficult in backbone networks because tracking the possibly hundreds of thousands of flows needs correspondingly large high-speed memories. To reduce the measurement overhead, many previous papers have proposed the use of random sampling and this is also used in commercial routers (Cisco's Net Flow). Our goal is to develop a new scheme that has very low memory requirements and has quick convergence to within a prespecified accuracy. We achieve this by use of a novel approach based on sampling two-runs to estimate per-flow traffic. (A flow has a two-run when two consecutive samples belong to the same flow). Sampling two-runs automatically biases the samples towards the larger flows thereby making the estimation of these sources more accurate. This biased sampling leads to significantly smaller memory requirement compared to random sampling schemes. The scheme is very simple to implement and performs extremely well},

volume={3},

pages={1819-1829 vol.3},
abstract={We study the problem of bandwidth fragmentation in links that comprise rings and meshes in SONET networks. Fragmentation is a serious challenge for network operators since it creates "holes" in the transport pipe causing new demands to be rejected, in spite of sufficient bandwidth being available. Unlike the well-studied, general fragmentation problem, link defragmentation is "hard" and novel due to some unique constraints imposed by the SONET standard. Since a defragmentation operation typically occurs on a network carrying live traffic, in addition to the "quality" of the output, any link defragmentation algorithm has to avoid traffic hit and also optimize the "cost" of reorganizing circuits. We propose an algorithm called mobipack that is optimal in its defragmentation quality. Moreover, we demonstrate via extensive simulations, that it also achieves its goal in a hitless manner with only marginal additional cost over the optimal, making it extremely attractive to use in practice},

volume={3},
number={},
pages={1830-1840 vol.3},
abstract={Waveband switching (WBS) in conjunction with multigranular optical cross-connect (MG-OXC) architectures can reduce the cost and complexity of switching nodes. In this paper, we study two MG-OXC architectures: the single-layer and the multilayer MG-OXCs, and compare their performances with both off-line (static) and on-line (dynamic) traffic. In the off-line case, a near-optimal integer linear programming models (called off-ILP models) for each of the MG-OXC architectures aims to reduce the size of the MG-OXC, and compares them with the balanced path routing with heavy-traffic first waveband assignment (BPHT) heuristic developed for the multilayer MG-OXCs. The two architectures are then compared in terms of the number of wavelength a fixed number of wavelengths on each link. We also propose a novel efficient heuristic algorithm, called maximum overlap ratio (MOR) to satisfy new requests and compare it with the on-ILP, first-fit, and random-fit algorithms. We compare the two architectures in terms of the blocking probability, weighted (request) acceptance ratio, which serves as an indication of hops (WH) and MG-OXC ports required to satisfy a given set of traffic demands. In the on-line case, we develop an on-line ILP model called on-ILP, which aims to minimize the number of used ports for each of the MG-OXC architectures, given the revenue generated by satisfying the requests. Our results indicate that using WBS with either single-layer or multilayer MG-OXCs can reduce the number of ports (hence the size and cost) of the switching nodes compared to using ordinary OXCs (without waveband switching). In particular, in the off-line case, using single-layer MG-OXCs provides a greater reduction in size than multilayer MG-OXCs, while in the online case, using the multilayer MG-OXC is better},

Most of existing WDM optical switching networks belong to the first category. In this paper we present new designs for WDM optical switching networks under both models by using sparse crossbar switches instead of full crossbar switches in combination with wavelength converters. The newly designed sparse WDM optical switching networks have minimum hardware cost in terms of both the number of crosspoints and the number of wavelength converters. The single stage and multistage implementations of the sparse WDM optical switching networks are considered. An optimal routing algorithm for the proposed sparse WDM optical switching networks is also presented},

pages={1853-1863 vol.3},
abstract={A key problem in optical burst switching (OBS) is to schedule as many bursts as possible on wavelength channels so that the throughput is maximized and the burst loss is minimized. In this paper, we use competitive analysis to analyze the worst-case performance of a large set of scheduling algorithms, called best-effort online scheduling algorithms, for OBS networks, and establish a number of interesting upper and lower bounds on the performance of such algorithms. A surprising discovery is that the worst-case performance of any best-effort online scheduling algorithm is primarily determined by the maximum to minimum burst length ratio, followed by the range of offset time. Furthermore, if all bursts have the same burst length and offset time, all best-effort online scheduling algorithms generate the same optimal solution, regardless how different they may look like. Our analysis can also be extended to some nonbest-effort online scheduling algorithms, such as the well-known Horizon algorithm, and establish similar bounds. Based on the analytic results, we give guidelines for several widely discussed OBS problems, including burst assembly, offset time setting and scheduling algorithm design, and propose a new channel reservation protocol called VFO to improve the worst-case performance. Our simulation shows that it is quite often for an online scheduling algorithm to exhibit its (near) worst-case performance. Thus improving the worst-case performance is essential. Our simulation also suggests that VFO reduces the average burst loss rate by as much as 35%},

abstract={Methods to resolve wavelength contention are needed to improve the performance of optical burst switched (OBS) networks. Network simulations and Markovian queuing models for nodes in isolation have suggested that deflection routing (alternate routing) may be a viable method to resolve wavelength contention. However, we show that deflection routing may destabilise OBS networks operating at high loads. To prevent the destabilising effect of deflection routing, we propose and analyse a technique called wavelength reservation to intentionally limit the amount of deflection at high loads. Wavelength reservation is analogous to trunk reservation in circuit switched networks. This paper is the first to present a new reduced load Erlang fixed point analysis of OBS networks with deflection routing and wavelength reservation. We apply the new analysis to evaluate the benefit of deploying deflection routing and wavelength reservation in a sample OBS network},

abstract={The potential for exploiting rate variations to increase the capacity of wireless systems by opportunistic scheduling has been extensively studied at packet level. In the present paper, we examine how slower, mobility-induced rate variations impact performance at flow level, accounting for the random number of flows sharing the transmission resource. We identify two limit regimes, termed fluid and quasistationary, where the rate variations occur on an infinitely fast and an infinitely slow time scale, respectively. Using stochastic comparison techniques, we show that these limit regimes provide simple performance bounds that only depend on easily calculated load factors. Additionally, we prove that for a broad class of fading processes, performance varies monotically with the speed of the rate variations. These results are illustrated through numerical experiments, showing that the fluid and quasistationary bounds are remarkably tight in certain usual cases},

Large-scale GPRS measurements in seven countries are presented to analyze TCP performance and demonstrate the applicability of the method.

abstract={As third generation (3G) wireless networks with high data rate get widely deployed, optimizing TCP performance over these networks would have a broad and significant impact on data application performance. One of the biggest challenges in optimizing TCP performance over the 3G wireless networks is adapting to the significant delay and rate variations over the wireless channel. In this paper, we make two main contributions. First, we present a window regulator algorithm that uses the receiver window field in the acknowledgment packets to convey the instantaneous wireless channel conditions to the TCP source and an ack buffer to absorb the channel variations, thereby maximizing long-lived TCP performance. It improves the performance of TCP sack by up to 100% over a simple drop-tail algorithm for small buffer sizes at the congested router. Second, we present a wireless channel and TCP-aware scheduling and buffer sharing algorithm that reduces the latency of short TCP flows by up to 90% while still exploiting user diversity, thus allowing the wireless channel to be utilized efficiently},

abstract={IP-based radio access networks (RAN) are expected to be the next generation access networks in UMTS and CDMA networks. There are several benefits of IP-based RAN including lower costs, flexibility of merging wired and wireless networks, and network scalability and reliability. While quality of service issues in IP-based RAN have been addressed by a number of researchers, the question of connectivity, i.e., how best to connect base stations to the radio network controllers (RNC) in an IP-based RAN, has not been addressed by any research literature. Furthermore, given a connection configuration, an RNC selection algorithm that assigns an incoming call to an RNC is also necessary. This paper examines radio access network (RAN) connectivity and its impact on the performance and resiliency of the wireless network using different RNC selection algorithms. The proposed min-load-1 algorithm, which allows at most one hard hand off in order to accommodate each incoming request, delivers performance close to the standard Min-Load algorithm using a RAN of much higher connectivity and is close to the optimal algorithm using the same RAN. We also find that using min-load-1 algorithm and allowing the base stations to connect to two RNCs result in resiliency to RNC failures that is similar to having full-mesh connectivity between base stations and RNCs},

abstract={We consider the maximization when designing ad-hoc wireless network protocols such as routing or MAC. We focus on maximizing rates under battery lifetime and power constraints. Commonly used metrics are total capacity (in the case of cellular networks) and transport capacity (in the case of ad-hoc networks). We review this issue for wireless ad-hoc networks. The story is different for max-min fairness. We show that, in the limit of long battery lifetime, the max-min allocation of rates always leads to strictly equal rates, regardless of the MAC layer, network topology, choice of routes and power constraints. This is due to the "solidarity" property of the set of feasible rates. This results in all flows receiving the rate of the worst flow, and leads to severe inefficiency. We show numerically that the problem persists when battery lifetime constraints are finite. This generalizes the observation reported in the literature that, in heterogeneous settings, 802.11 allocates the worst rate to all stations, and shows that this is inherent to any protocol that implements max-min fairness. Proportional fairness is an alternative to max-min fairness that approximates rate allocation performed by TCP in the Internet. We show by numerical simulations that proportional fairness of rates or transport rates is robust and achieves a good trade-off between efficiency and fairness, unlike total rate or maximum fairness. We thus recommend that metrics for the rate performance of mobile ad-hoc networking protocols be based on proportional fairness},

pages={1928-1937 vol.3},
abstract={Multipath routing enables a network's traffic to be split among two or more possibly disjoint paths in order to reduce latency, improve throughput, and balance traffic loads. Yet, once the control plane establishes multiple routes, a policy is needed for efficiently splitting traffic among the selected paths. In this paper, we introduce opportunistic multipath scheduling (OMS), a technique for exploiting short term variations in path quality to minimize delay, while simultaneously ensuring that the splitting rules dictated by the routing protocol are satisfied. In particular, OMS uses measured path conditions on time scales of up to several seconds to opportunistically favor low-latency high-throughput paths. Consequently, OMS ensures that over longer time scales relevant for traffic management policies, traffic is split according to the ratios determined by the routing protocol. We develop a model of OMS and derive an asymptotic lower bound on the performance of OMS as a function of path conditions (mean, variance, and Hurst parameter) for self-similar traffic. An example finding from the model is that long-time-scale traffic fluctuations represented by a larger Hurst parameter improve the performance gain of OMS vs. round-robin scheduling, even under paths that are statistically identical. Finally, we use an extensive simulation-based performance study to evaluate the accuracy of the analytical model, explore the impact of OMS on TCP throughput, and study the impact of factors such as delayed measurements},

abstract={In this paper, packet scheduling with maximum delay constraints is considered with the objective to minimize average transmit power over Gaussian channels. The main emphasis is on deriving robust schedulers which do not rely on the knowledge of the source arrival process. Towards that end, we first show that all schedulers (robust or otherwise) which guarantee a maximum queuing delay for each packet are equivalent to a time-varying linear filter. Using the connection between filtering and scheduling, we study the design of optimal power minimizing robust schedulers. Two cases, motivated by filtering connection, are studied in detail. First, a time-invariant robust scheduler is presented and its performance is completely characterized. Second, we present the optimal time-varying robust scheduler, and show that it has a very intuitive time water-filling structure. We also present upper and lower bounds on the performance of power-minimizing schedulers as a function of delay constraints. The new results form an important step towards understanding of the packet time-scale interactions between physical layer metric of power and network layer metric of delay},

abstract={We study the provision of deterministic rate guarantees over single crossbar switches. Birkhoff decomposition yields a general approach for this problem, but the required complexity can be very high and the quality of service can be unsatisfactory for practical traffic sources. We develop a method called rate quantization which works with any resource speedup greater than 1 to convert the set of desired rates into a certain discrete set in such a way that the complexity and the quality of service guarantees can be greatly improved over a Birkhoff switch. Moreover, quantization enables us to develop a Slepian-Duguid-like algorithm that enables the switch to both adapt to dynamically varying traffic and simplify switch scheduling significantly},

number={},
pages={1974-1983 vol.3},
abstract={In this paper we study the optimality of an index policy for a bandwidth allocation problem, where a single server is allocated among N queues in a slotted system based on the queue backlog information. Due to the physical nature of the system this information is delayed, in that when the allocation decision is made, the server only has the backlog information from an earlier time. This results in imperfect and partial state observation. Queues have Bernoulli arrival processes with different probabilities of arrival, as well as different buffering/holding costs to differentiate heterogeneous classes of traffic/service. The objective is to minimize the expected total discounted holding cost over a finite or infinite horizon. We introduce an index policy with indices defined as functions of the state of a queue. We first show that when the state of the system is away from the boundary, i.e., no empty queues, the index policy is optimal. When there are empty queues, we show that under sufficient separation of the indices the index policy is still optimal. We show by example that if the separation does not hold, the index policy is not necessarily optimal. We then formulate the optimal bandwidth allocation as a restless bandit problem and show under what conditions the index policy calculated using Whittle's heuristics, which in general is only asymptotically optimal, is optimal for the finite case},

abstract={Ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) is widely used in high-speed route lookup engines. However, restricted by the memory access speed, the route lookup engines for next-generation terabit routers demand exploiting parallelism among multiple TCAMs. Traditional parallel methods always incur excessive redundancy and high power consumption. We propose in this paper an original TCAM-based IP lookup scheme that achieves an ultra high lookup throughput and a high utilization of the memory while being power efficient. In our multichip scheme, we devise a load-balanced TCAM table construction algorithm together with an adaptive load balancing mechanism. The power efficiency is well controlled by decreasing the number of TCAM entries triggered in each lookup operation. Using 133 MHz TCAM chips and given 25% more TCAM entries than the original route table, the proposed scheme achieves a lookup throughput of up to 533 Mpps and is simple for ASIC implementation},

title={Mailbox switch: a scalable two-stage switch architecture for conflict resolution of ordered packets},
year={2004},
volume={3},
number={},
pages={1995-2006 vol.3},
abstract={Traditionally, conflict resolution in an input-buffered switch is solved by finding a matching between inputs and outputs per time slot. To do this, a switch not only needs to gather the information of the virtual output queues at the inputs, hut also uses the gathered information to compute a matching. As such, both the communication overhead and the computation overhead make it difficult to scale. Recent works on the two-stage switch architecture in (6|, [7], [12], (8| showed that conflict resolution can be easily solved over time and space without communication and computation overhead. However, the main problem of such a two-stage switch architecture is that packets might be out of sequence. The main objective of this paper is to propose a scalable solution, called the mailbox switch, that solves the out-of-sequence problem in the two-stage switch architecture. The key idea of the mailbox switch is to use a set of symmetric connection patterns to create a feedback path for packet departure times. With the information of packet departure times, the mailbox switch can schedule packets so that they depart in the order of their arrivals. Despite the simplicity of the mailbox switch, we show via both the theoretical models and simulations that the throughput of the mailbox switch can be as high as 75%. With limited resequencing delay, a modified version of the mailbox switch achieves 95% throughput. We also propose a recursive way to construct the switch fabrics for the set of symmetric connection patterns. If the number of inputs, N, is a power of 2, we show that the switch fabric for the mailbox switch can be built with N/2 log<sub>2 </sub> N 2times2 switches},

In this paper we derive an expression for the number of MEMS switches that are needed, and describe an algorithm to configure them.

abstract={Currently, the Internet is dominated by TCP traffic. TCP is congestion aware, shares bandwidth with other TCP flows, and is stable because most flows are congestion reactive. It has been shown that current AQM schemes may not be resistant to greedy traffic agents. Thus, it is important to study mechanisms which provide incentives to greedy agents to come to an equilibrium state in their own selfish interest. In addition, we want our AQM schemes to he oblivious to the flows identities which makes them easier to scale and deploy. In this paper, we show that if routers used EWMA to measure the aggregate rate, then the best strategy for a selfish agent to minimize its losses is to arrive at a constant rate. Even though the protocol space is arbitrary, our scheme ensures that the best greedy strategy is simple, i.e. send with CBR. Then, we show how we can use the results of an earlier paper to enforce simple and efficient protocol equilibria on selfish traffic agents},

abstract={We present new results and numerical studies of very fast schedulers for SMS (switch-memory-switch) routers, which emulate output-queuing by buffering packets in a partitioned shared-memory located between input and output ports. The architecture of Juniper's core routers and Brocade's storage switches is based on SMS. Our numerical results demonstrate that RiPSS, a randomized highly parallel SMS scheduler that we had developed recently, runs in just 3 rounds on switches with up to 4,096 inputs, and has a very low drop probability. We also show that RiPSS makes effective use of the shared-memory, with packets being uniformly distributed across the memory hanks for both Bernoulli and bursty arrivals. We describe a new and improved randomized pipelined scheduler, PRiPSS, and analyze its performance. Both our analysis and our simulation results for PRiPSS show that it has better throughput than RiPSS with a slightly higher latency in terms of rounds of communication in the underlying hardware. Our analysis also shows that PRiPSS is self-stabilizing, i.e., if occasional lapses occur due to the probabilistic nature of the algorithm, it resumes normal behavior without the need for external intervention. While the choice of RiPSS or PRiPSS would depend on whether throughput or latency is the primary concern, our results indicate that both schedulers are much faster than other schedulers for output-queuing, whether implemented directly or through emulation on SMS},

abstract={By analyzing the steady state throughput of TCP flows in differentiated service (DiffServ) networks, we show that current DiffServ networks are biased in favor of those flows that have a smaller target rate, which results in unfair bandwidth allocation. In order to solve this unfairness problem, we propose an adaptive marking scheme, which allocates bandwidth in a manner which is proportional to the target rates of the aggregate TCP flows in the DiffServ network. This scheme adjusts the target rate according to the congestion level of the network, so that the aggregate flow can obtain its fair share of the bandwidth. Since it utilizes edge-to-edge feedback information without measuring or keeping any per-flow state, this scheme is scalable and does not require any additional signaling protocol or any significant changes to the current TCP/IP protocol. It can he implemented in a distributed manner using only two-bit feedback information, which is carried in the TCP acknowledgement. Using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed scheme can provide each aggregate flow with its fair share of the bandwidth, which is proportional to the target rate, under various network conditions},

abstract={The high diversity in the capabilities of various mobile devices such as display capabilities and computation power makes the design of mobile information systems more challenging. A transcoding proxy is placed between a client and an information server to coordinate the mismatch between what the server provides and what the client prefers. However, most research works in transcoding proxies in mobile computing environments are under the traditional client-server architecture and do not employ the data broadcast technique which is has been deemed a promising technique to design a power conservation, high scalable and high band-width utilization. In addition, the issue of QoS provision is also not addressed. In view of this, we design in this paper a QoS-aware transcoding proxy by utilizing the on-demand broadcasting technique. We first propose a QoS-aware transcoding proxy architecture, abbreviated as QTP, and model it as a queueing network. By analyzing the queueing network, several theoretical results are derived. We then propose a version decision policy and a service admission control scheme to provide QoS in QTP. The derived results are used to guide the execution of the proposed version decision policy and service admission control scheme to achieve the given QoS requirement. To measure the performance of QTP, several experiments are conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is more scalable than traditional client-server systems. In addition, the proposed scheme is able to effectively control the system load to attain the desired QoS},

abstract={Provisioning techniques for network flows with end-to-end QoS guarantees need to address the interpath and intrapath load balancing problems to maximize the resource utilization efficiency. This paper focuses on the intrapath load balancing problem: How to partition the end-to-end QoS requirement of a network flow along the links of a given path such that the deviation in the loads on these links is as small as possible? We propose a new algorithm to solve the end-to-end QoS partitioning problem for unicast and multicast flows that takes into account the loads on the constituent links of the chosen flow path. This algorithm can simultaneously partition multiple end-to-end QoS requirements such as the end-to-end delay and delay violation probability bound. The key concept in our proposal is the notion of slack, which quantifies the extent of flexibility available in partitioning the end-to-end delay requirement across the links of a selected path (or a multicast tree). We show that one can improve network resource usage efficiency by carefully selecting a slack partition that explicitly balances the loads on the underlying links. A detailed simulation study demonstrates that, compared with previous approaches, the proposed delay budget partitioning algorithm can increase the total number of long-term flows that can be provisioned along a network path by up to 1.2 times for deterministic and 2.8 times for statistical delay guarantees},

abstract={This paper proposes a new QoS framework, called the on-demand QoS path framework (ODP). ODP provides end-to-end QoS guarantees to individual flows with minimal overhead, while keeping the scalability characteristic of Diff-Serv. ODP exercises per-flow admission control and end-to-end bandwidth reservation at the edge of the network and only differentiates traffic classes in the core of the network. In addition, to adapt to dynamically changing traffic load, ODP monitors the bandwidth utilization of the network and performs dynamic bandwidth reconfiguration in the network core. Through extensive simulations, the performance of ODP is investigated and compared with that of IntServ and DiffServ frameworks. The simulation results clearly show that ODP provides end-to-end QoS guarantees to individual flows, which DiffServ can not provide, with much less overhead than IntServ},

abstract={Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) suffer from high transmission error rate because of the nature of radio communications. The broadcast operation, as a fundamental service in MANETs, is prone to the broadcast storm problem if forward nodes are not carefully designated. The objective of reducing the broadcast redundancy while still providing high delivery ratio for each broadcast packet is a major challenge in a dynamic environment. In this paper, we propose a simple, reliable broadcast algorithm, called double-covered broadcast (DCB), that takes advantage of broadcast redundancy to improve the delivery ratio in the environment that has rather high transmission error rate. Among 1-hop neighbors of the sender, only selected forward nodes retransmit the broadcast message. Forward nodes are selected in such a way that (1) the sender's 2-hop neighbors are covered and (2) the sender's 1-hop neighbors are either a forward node, or a nonforward node but covered by at least two forwarding neighbors. The retransmissions of the forward nodes are received by the sender as confirmation of their receiving the packet. The nonforward 1-hop neighbors of the sender do not acknowledge the reception of the broadcast. If the sender does not detect all its forward nodes' retransmissions, it will resend the packet until the maximum times of retry is reached. Simulation results show that the algorithm provides good performance for a broadcast operation under high transmission error rate environment},

abstract={In this paper, we have proposed a novel concept called Hitch-hiking in order to reduce the energy consumption of broadcast application for wireless networks. Hitch-hiking takes advantage of the physical layer design that facilitates the combining of partial signals to obtain the complete information. The concept of combining partial signals using maximal ratio combiner [J.G. Proakis, 2001] has been used to improve the reliability of the communication channel but has never been exploited to reduce energy consumption. We propose a centralized heuristic algorithm called wireless multicast with Hitch-hiking (WMH) to construct an energy efficient tree using Hitch-hiking and also present a distributed version of the heuristic. We also evaluate the proposed heuristics through simulation. Simulation results show that Hitch-hiking can reduce the transmission cost of broadcast by as much as 50%.

abstract={This paper presents a novel protocol for a spatiotemporal variant of multicast called mobicast, designed to support message delivery in ad hoc sensor networks. The spatiotemporal character of mobicast relates to the obligation to deliver a message to all the nodes that will he present at time t in some geographic zone Z, where both the location and shape of the delivery zone are a function of time over some interval (t <sub>start</sub>, t<sub>end</sub>). The protocol, called face-aware routing (FAR), exploits ideas adapted from existing applications of face routing to achieve reliable mobicast delivery. The key features of the protocol are a routing strategy, which uses information confined solely to a node's immediate spatial neighborhood, and a forwarding schedule, which employs only local topological information. Statistical results shows that, in uniformly distributed random disk graphs, the spatial neighborhood size is usually less than 20. This suggests that FAR is likely to exhibit a low average memory cost. An estimation formula for the average size of the spatial neighborhood in a random network is another analytical result reported in this paper. This paper also presents a novel and low cost distributed algorithm for spatial neighborhood discovery},

abstract={Many potential applications of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) involve group communications among the nodes. Multicasting is an useful operation that facilitates group communications. Efficient and scalable multicast routing in MANETs is a difficult issue. In addition to the conventional multicast routing algorithms, recent protocols have adopted the following new approaches: overlays, backbone-based, and stateless. In this paper, we study these approaches from the protocol state management point of view, and compare their scalability behaviors. To enhance performance and enable scalability, we have proposed a framework for hierarchical multicasting in MANET environments. Two classes of hierarchical multicasting approaches, termed as domain-based and overlay-based, are proposed. We have considered a variety of approaches that are suitable for different mobility patterns and multicast group sizes. Results obtained through simulations demonstrate enhanced performance and scalability of the proposed techniques},

pages={2130-2141 vol.3},
abstract={Third generation cellular wireless networks are designed to support adaptive multimedia by controlling individual ongoing flows to increase or decrease their bandwidth in response to changes in traffic load There is growing interest in quality of service (QoS) provisioning under this adaptive multimedia framework, in which a bandwidth adaptation algorithm needs to be used in conjunction with the call admission control algorithm. This paper presents a novel method for QoS provisioning via the use of the average reward reinforcement learning, which can maximize the network revenue subject to several predetermined QoS constraints. By considering handoff dropping probability, average allocated bandwidth and intraclass fairness simultaneously, our algorithm formulation guarantees that these QoS parameters are kept within predetermined constraints. Unlike other model-based algorithms, our scheme does not require explicit state transition probabilities and therefore the assumptions behind the underlying system model are more realistic than those in previous schemes. Moreover, by considering the status of neighboring cells, the proposed scheme can dynamically adapt to changes in traffic condition. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adaptive multimedia cellular networks},

abstract={With the convergence of wired line Internet and mobile wireless networks as well as tremendous demand on video application in mobile wireless Internet, it's essential to design an effective video streaming protocol and an efficient resource allocation scheme for video delivery over wireless Internet. In this paper, we employ WMSTFP, an end-to-end TCP-friendly multimedia streaming protocol, to detect the status of the wired and wireless part of the wireless Internet, where only the last hop is wireless link. By accurately distinguishing the packet losses due to transmission errors from the congestive losses and smoothing out the pathologic round-trip-time values caused by the highly dynamic wireless environment, in WMSTFP higher throughput in wireless Internet can be achieved and rate can be adjusted in a smooth and TCP-friendly manner. Based upon WMSTFP, we propose a novel loss pattern differentiated bit allocation scheme while applying unequal loss protection (ULP) for scalable video streaming over wireless Internet. Specifically, a rate-distortion (R-D) based bit allocation scheme which considers both wired and wireless network status is proposed to minimize the expected end-to-end distortion. The optimal solution of global optimization for the bit allocation scheme is obtained by a local search algorithm taking the characteristics of progressive fine granularity scalable (PFGS) video into account. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes},

In EDCF, differentiated services are provided for different traffic classes. In this paper, we propose a two-level protection and guarantee mechanism for voice and video traffic in IEEE 802.11e wireless LANs. In the first-level protection, the existing voice and video flows are protected from the new and other existing voice and video flows. In the second-level protection, the voice and video flows are protected from the best-effort data traffic. For each protection level, a couple of protection mechanisms are proposed. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed two-level protection and guarantee mechanism is very effective in terms of protecting and guaranteeing existing voice and video flows as well as fully utilizing the channel capacity},

The question for realtime video is, given the bandwidth and delay constraints, how to achieve maximal visual quality when the channel is subjected to random and bursty errors. The goal of this paper is to salvage as many data from the damaged packets as possible for the highest possible visual quality. In this work, we propose a bitstream level error correction/concealment method using reliability information from soft output channel decoder.

volume={2},

pages={762-773 vol.2},
abstract={Internet measurements show that a small number of large TCP flows are responsible for the largest amount of data transferred, whereas most of the TCP sessions are made up of few packets. Several authors have invoked this property to suggest the use of scheduling algorithms, which favor short jobs, such as LAS (least attained service), to differentiate between short and long TCP flows. We propose a packet level stateless, threshold based scheduling mechanism for TCP flows, RuN2C. We describe an implementation of this mechanism, which has the advantage of being TCP compatible and progressively deployable. We compare the behavior of RuN2C with LAS based mechanisms through analytical models and simulations. As an analytical model, we use a two level priority processor sharing PS + PS. In the PS + PS system, a connection is classified as high or low priority depending on the amount of service it has obtained. We show that PS + PS reduces the mean response time in comparison with standard processor sharing when the hazard rate of the file size distribution is decreasing. By simulations we study the impact of RuN2C on extreme values of response times and the mean number of connections in the system. Both simulations and analytical results show that RuN2C has a very beneficial effect on the delay of short flows, while treating large flows as the current TCP implementation does. In contrast, we find that LAS based mechanisms can lead to pathological behavior in extreme cases.},

abstract={This paper compares Reno, new-Reno and selective acknowledgements (SACK), the three most common TCP implementations today in (future) optical burst switched (OBS) networks. In general, SACK, which considers multiple triple duplicated ACKed (TD) losses in one round, is found to perform best in OBS networks, while new-Reno, which improves Reno in packet switched networks by fast retransmission in responding to partial ACKs, may however perform worse than Reno. All three TCP implementations react to a time out (TO) loss in the same way (i.e., using slow start). In OBS networks, where a burst may contain all packets from one round, and a burst loss occurs mainly due to contention instead of buffer overflow, such a TO event may no longer imply heavy congestion, or in other words, it may he a false TO or FTO. Such FTOs, which may he common in OBS networks especially for fast TCP flows, can significantly degrade the performance of all existing TCP implementations. Accordingly, we also propose a new TCP implementation called burst TCP (BTCP) which can detect FTOs and react properly, and as a result, improve over the existing TCP implementations significantly.},

abstract={We present results from a detailed energy measurement study of TCP. We focus on the node-level cost of the TCP protocol and obtain a breakdown of the energy cost of different TCP functions. We analyze the energy consumption of TCP on two platforms (laptop and iPAQ) and three operating systems (FreeBSD 4.2, 5 and Linux 2.4.7). Our results show that 60-70% of the energy cost (for transmission or reception) is accounted for by the kernel NIC (network interface card) copy operation. Of the remainder, /spl sim/15% is accounted for in the copy operation from user space to kernel space with the remaining 15% being accounted for by TCP processing costs. We then further analyze the 15% TCP processing cost and show that the cost of computing checksums accounts for 20-30% of TCP processing cost. Finally, we determine the processing costs of two primary TCP functions - timeouts and triple duplicate ACKs. Pulling all these costs together, we present techniques whereby energy savings of between 20%-30% in the computational cost of TCP can be achieved.},

abstract={Next generation networks with large bandwidth and long delay pose a major challenge to TCP performance, especially during the startup period. We evaluate the performance of TCP Reno/Newreno, Vegas and Hoe's modification in large bandwidth delay networks. We propose a modified slow-start mechanism, called adaptive start (Astart), to improve the startup performance in such networks. When a connection initially begins or re-starts after a coarse timeout, Astart adaptively and repeatedly resets the slow-start threshold (ssthresh) based on an eligible sending rate estimation mechanism proposed in TCP Westwood. By adapting to network conditions during the startup phase, a sender is able to grow the congestion window (cwnd) fast without incurring risk of buffer overflow and multiple losses. Simulation experiments show that Astart can significantly improve the link utilization under various bandwidth, buffer size and round-trip propagation times. The method avoids both under-utilization due to premature slow-start termination, as well as multiple losses due to initially setting ssthresh too high, or increasing cwnd too fast. Experiments also show that Astart achieves good fairness and friendliness toward TCP New Reno. Lab measurements using a Free BSD Astart implementation are also reported in this paper, providing further evidence of the gains achievable via Astart.},

abstract={The rapid growth of time-critical information services and business-oriented applications is making quality of service (QoS) support increasingly important in content distribution. This paper investigates the problem of placing object replicas (e.g., web pages and images) to meet the QoS requirements of clients with the objective of minimizing the replication cost. We consider two classes of service models: replica-aware service and replica-blind service. In the replica-aware model, the servers are aware of the locations of replicas and can therefore direct requests to the nearest replica. We show that the QoS-aware placement problem for replica-aware services is NP-complete. Several heuristic algorithms for efficient computation of suboptimal solutions are proposed and experimentally evaluated. In the replica-blind model, the servers are not aware of the locations of replicas or even their existence. As a result, each replica only serves the requests flowing through it under some given routing strategy. We show that there exist polynomial optimal solutions to the QoS-aware placement problem for replica-blind services. Efficient algorithms are proposed to compute the optimal locations of replicas under different cost models.},

We present an architecture in which dispatchers at an overloaded Internet data center (IDC) redirect requests for dynamic content to a geographically remote but less loaded IDC. We show with both analytical modeling as well as testbed experiments that the delay savings of redirecting requests to a lightly loaded IDC can far outweigh the overhead in interIDC network latency. Consequently, client end-to-end delays are significantly reduced without requiring modifications to clients, servers, or DNS.},

abstract={With the proliferation of Internet services, many solutions have emerged to provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees when the demands for the hosted services exceed the server's capacity. We take an analytical approach to answering key questions in the design and performance of application-level QoS techniques, especially those that are based on the multi-threading or multi-processing abstraction. Key to our analysis is the integration of the effects of concurrency into the interactions between multi-threaded services. To this end, we extend traditional time-sharing models to develop the multi-threaded round-robin (MTRR) servers, a more accurate model of operation of typical multi-threaded Internet services. For this model, we first develop powerful, yet computationally-efficient, mathematical relationships that describe the performance (in terms of throughput and response time) of multi-threaded services. We then apply optimization techniques to derive the optimal allocation of threads given specific QoS objective functions. Using realistic workloads on a typical Web server, we show the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed new methodology.},

abstract={The performance of demand-driven caching depends on the locality of reference exhibited by the stream of requests made to the cache. In particular, it is expected that the stronger the locality of reference, the smaller the miss rate of the cache. For the independent reference model, this amounts to a smaller miss rate when the popularity distribution of requested objects in the stream is more skewed. We formalize this "folk theorem" through the companion concepts of majorization and Schur-concavity. This folk theorem is established for caches operating under a random on-demand replacement algorithm (RORA). However, the result fails to hold in general under the (popular) LRU and CLIMB policies, but can he established when the input has a Zipf-like popularity pmf with large skewness parameter. In addition, we explore how the majorization of popularity distributions translates into comparisons of three well-known locality of reference metrics, namely the inter-reference time, the working set size and the stack distance.},

abstract={The fair queuing model has been widely used to provide QoS for flows sharing a wireless channel. In fluid fair queuing, a flow cannot reclaim its service loss due to absence. As a result, fair queuing models that emulate fluid fair queuing cannot provide good service differentiation under bursty data traffic. On the other hand, strict priority queuing (SPQ) can provide good service differentiation at the cost of QoS provision. To achieve both service differentiation and QoS provision, we propose a new service model called absence compensation fair queuing. The basic idea is to allow a flow to get compensation of its service loss due to absence. Since the proposed service model is based on fair queuing, QoS provision is guaranteed. We first verify these properties by analysis, and then evaluate the performance compared to weighted fair queuing (WFQ) and SPQ. Simulation results show that our service model can provide much better service differentiation than WFQ, and outperforms SPQ in terms of QoS provision.},

abstract={There are a number of scenarios where it is desirable to have a wireless device connect to multiple networks simultaneously. Currently, this is possible only by using multiple wireless network cards in the device. Unfortunately, using multiple wireless cards causes excessive energy drain and consequent reduction of lifetime in battery operated devices. We propose a software based approach, called MultiNet, that facilitates simultaneous connections to multiple networks by virtualizing a single wireless card. The wireless card is virtualized by introducing an intermediate layer below IP, which continuously switches the card across multiple networks. The goal of the switching algorithm is to he transparent to the user who sees her machine as being connected to multiple networks. We present the design, implementation, and performance of the MultiNet system. We analyze and evaluate buffering and switching algorithms in terms of delay and energy consumption. Our system is agnostic of the upper layer protocols, and works well over popular IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN cards.},

abstract={We propose a multi-hop wireless LAN architecture and demonstrate its benefits to wireless clients. For this architecture, we define implementation paths that allow interoperation with existing wireless LANs which can lead to an incremental deployment of this system. We quantify the performance benefits of the proposed schemes through measurements in realistic wireless LAN environments. We also examine the performance of such multi-hop wireless LANs through detailed simulation studies. Our results show that these multi-hop extensions can significantly improve the wireless access experience (in terms of data throughput, latency, etc.) for clients who enable such mechanisms. More interestingly, when multi-hop extensions are enabled by some of the clients, it also positively impacts the performance at other clients that are completely unaware of these extensions.},

abstract={Our goal is to explore characteristics of the environment that provide opportunities for caching, prefetching, coverage planning, and resource reservation. We conduct a one-month measurement study of locality phenomena among wireless Web users and their association patterns on a major university campus using the IEEE 802.11 wireless infrastructure. We evaluate the performance of different caching paradigms, such as single user cache, cache attached to an access point (AP), and peer-to-peer caching. In several settings such caching mechanisms could be beneficial. Unlike other measurement studies in wired networks in which 25% to 40% of documents draw 70% of Web access, our traces indicate that 13% of unique URLS draws this number of Web accesses. In addition, the overall ideal hit ratio of the user cache, cache attached to an access point, and peer-to-peer caching paradigms (where peers are coresident within an AP) are 51%, 55%, and 23%, respectively. We distinguish wireless clients based on their inter-building mobility, their visits to APs, their continuous walks in the wireless infrastructure, and their wireless information access during these periods. We model the associations as a Markov chain using as state information the most recent AP visits. We can predict with high probability (86%) the next AP with which a wireless client will associate. Also, there are APs with a high percentage of user revisits. Such measurements can benefit protocols and algorithms that aim to improve the performance of the wireless infrastructures by load balancing, admission control, and resource reservation across APs.},

pages={918-928 vol.2},
abstract={This work proposes a routing scheme for content-based networking. A content-based network is a communication network that features a new advanced communication model where messages are not given explicit destination addresses, and where the destinations of a message are determined by matching the content of the message against selection predicates declared by nodes. Routing in a content-based network amounts to propagating predicates and the necessary topological information in order to maintain loop-free and possibly minimal forwarding paths for messages. The routing scheme we propose uses a combination of a traditional broadcast protocol and a content-based routing protocol. We present the combined scheme and its requirements over the broadcast protocol. We then detail the content-based routing protocol, highlighting a set of optimization heuristics. We also present the results of our evaluation, showing that this routing scheme is effective and scalable.},

pages={929-940 vol.2},
abstract={Efficient event delivery in a content-based publish/subscribe system has been a challenging problem. Existing group communication solutions, such as IP multicast or application-level multicast techniques, are not readily applicable due to the highly heterogeneous communication pattern in such systems. We first explore the design space of event routing strategies for content-based publish/subscribe systems. Two major existing approaches are studied: filter-hosed approach, which performs content-based filtering on intermediate routing servers to dynamically guide routing decisions, and multicast-based approach, which delivers events through a few high-quality multicast groups that are pre-constructed to approximately match user interests. These approaches have different trade-offs in the routing quality achieved and the implementation cost and system load generated. We then present a new routing scheme called Kyra that carefully balance these trade-offs. Kyra combines the advantages of content-based filtering and event-space partitioning in the existing approaches to achieve better overall routing efficiency. We use detailed simulations to evaluate Kyra and compare it with existing approaches. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Kyra in achieving high network efficiency, reducing implementation cost and balancing system load across the publish-subscribe service network.},

Slurpie is specifically designed to reduce client download times for large, popular files, and to reduce load on servers that serve these files. Slurpie employs a novel adaptive downloading strategy to increase client performance, and employs a randomized backoff strategy to precisely control load on the server. We describe a full implementation of the Slurpie protocol, and present results from both controlled local-area and wide-area testbeds.

abstract={Web caches, content distribution networks, peer-to-peer file sharing networks, distributed file systems, and data grids all have in common that they involve a community of users who generate requests for shared data. In each case, overall system performance can be improved significantly if we can first identify and then exploit interesting structure within a community's access patterns. To this end, we propose a novel perspective on file sharing that considers the relationships that form among users based on the files in which they are interested. We propose a new structure that captures common user interests in data - the data-sharing graph - and justify its utility with studies on three data-distribution systems: a high-energy physics collaboration, the Web, and the Kazaa peer-to-peer network. We find small-world patterns in the data-sharing graphs of all three communities. We analyze these graphs and propose some probable causes for these emergent small-world patterns. The significance of small-world patterns is twofold: it provides a rigorous support to intuition and, perhaps most importantly, it suggests ways to design mechanisms that exploit these naturally emerging patterns.},

abstract={In a previous paper, BonaId and Roberts (June 2001) studied non-persistent TCP connections in transient overload conditions, under the assumption that all connections have the same round-trip times. In this paper our goal is to develop theoretical tools that will enable us to relax this assumption and obtain explicit expressions for the rate of growth of the number of connections at the system, the rate at which TCP connections leave the system, as well as the time needed for the completion of a connection. To that end, we model the system as a DPS (discriminatory processor sharing) system which we analyze under very mild assumptions on the probability distributions related to different classes of arrivals: we only assume that the arrival rates of connections exist, and that the amount of information transmitted during a connection of a given type forms a stationary ergodic sequence. We then proceed to obtain explicit expressions for the growth rate of the number of connections at the DPS system for several specific probability distributions. We check through simulations the applicability of our queueing results for modeling TCP connections sharing a bottleneck.},

We explicitly find bounds for this region under a particular quantization error model, and provide simulation results to verify the predicted behavior of the system.

abstract={The throughput of AIMD protocols in general and of TCP in particular, has been computed in many existing works by modeling the round-trip time as a constant and thus replacing the round-trip time by its expectation. There are however many scenarios in which the delays of packets vary, causing a variation of the round-trip time. Many typical scenarios occur in wireless and mobile networks. We propose in this paper an analytical model that accounts for the variability of delay, while computing the throughput of an AIMD protocol. We derive a closed-form expression for the throughput that illustrates the impact of the variability of delay. We show by analysis and simulation, that an increase in the variability of delay improves the performance of an AIMD protocol. Thus, an analytical model that only considers the average delay could underestimate the performance of an AIMD protocol in scenarios where delay is variable.},

abstract={In previous years, positioning systems for indoor areas using the existing wireless local area network infrastructure have been suggested. Such systems make use of location fingerprinting rather than time or direction of arrival techniques for determining the location of mobile stations. While experimental results related to such positioning systems have been presented, there is a lack of analytical models that can be used as a framework for designing and deploying the positioning systems. In this paper, we present an analytical model for analyzing such positioning systems. We develop the framework for analyzing a simple positioning system that employs the Euclidean distance between a sample signal vector and the location fingerprints of an area stored in a database. We analyze the effect of the number of access points that are visible and radio propagation parameters on the performance of the positioning system and provide some preliminary guidelines on its design.},

We show that the autocorrelation between consecutive samples from the same access point can be as high as 0.9. Using our model, we describe a technique to use multiple signal strength samples from each access point, taking the high autocorrelation into account, to achieve better accuracy. Implementation of the technique in the Horus system shows that the average system accuracy is increased by more than 50%. Our results show that assuming independence of samples from the same access point can lead to degraded performance as the number of samples used in the estimation algorithm is increased, due to the wrong independence assumption. We also discuss how to incorporate the new technique with other algorithms for enhancing the performance of WLAN location determination systems.},

We propose two location algorithms, selective fusion location estimation (SELFLOC) and region of confidence (RoC), which can be used in conjunction with classical location algorithms such as triangulation, or with third-party commercial location estimation systems. The SELFLOC algorithm infers the user location by selectively fusing location information from multiple wireless technologies and/or multiple classical location algorithms in a theoretically optimal manner. The RoC algorithm attempts to overcome the problem of aliasing in the signal domain, where different physical locations have similar RF characteristics, which is particularly acute when users are mobile. We have empirically validated the proposed algorithms using wireless LAN and Bluetooth technology. Our experimental results show that applying SELFLOC for stationary users when using multiple wireless technologies and multiple classical location algorithms can improve location accuracy significantly, with mean distance errors as low as 1.6 m. For mobile users we find that using RoC can allow us to obtain mean errors as low as 3.7 m. Both algorithms can be used in conjunction with a commercial location estimation system and improve its accuracy further.},

pages={1055-1066 vol.2},
abstract={A novel distributed power control (DPC) scheme for cellular networks in the presence of radio channel uncertainties such as path loss, shadowing, and Rayleigh fading is presented. Since these uncertainties can attenuate the received signal strength and can cause variations in the received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), the proposed DPC scheme maintains a target SIR at the receiver provided the uncertainty is slowly varying with time. The DPC estimates the time varying nature of the channel quickly and uses the information to arrive at a suitable transmitter power value. Further, the standard assumption of a constant interference during a link's power update used in other works in the literature is relaxed. A CDMA-based cellular network environment is used to compare the proposed scheme with earlier approaches. The results show that our DPC scheme can converge faster than others by adapting to the channel variations. The proposed DPC scheme can render outage probability of 5 to 30% in the presence of uncertainties compared with other schemes of 50 to 90% while consuming low power per active mobile user. In other words, the proposed DPC scheme allows significant increase in network capacity while consuming low power values even when the channel is uncertain.},

abstract={Dynamic power control and scheduling strategies provide efficient mechanisms for improving performance of wireless communications networks. A common objective is to maximize throughput performance of a network or to minimize the total transmission power while satisfying quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. The achievement of these objectives requires the development of medium access control (MAC) strategies that optimally utilize scarce resources in wireless networks. When developing such strategies, a good understanding of the structure of the feasibility region is essential. The feasibility region is defined as a set of all QoS requirements that can he supported by a network with all users active concurrently. Thus, the structure of this set shows when (if at all) scheduling strategies can improve network performance. In particular, if the feasibility region is a convex set, then concurrent transmission strategies are optimal and the optimal power allocation can be obtained efficiently via a convex optimization. Other important problems are how the total transmission power depends on QoS requirements and what the optimal QoS tradeoff is. In this paper, we address all these problems and solve them completely in some important cases. The purpose of this paper is to explore the interrelationship between QoS requirements and physical quantities such as transmission power. Although the results are obtained in the context of a power-controlled CDMA system, they also apply to some other communications systems. A key assumption is that there is a monotonous relationship between a QoS parameter of interest (such as data rate) and the signal-to-interference ratio at the output of a linear receiver.},

abstract={Routing problems in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET) have been receiving increasing attention in the last few years. Most of the proposed routing protocols concentrate on finding and maintaining routes in the face of changing topology caused by mobility or other environmental changes. More recently, power-aware routing protocols and topology control algorithms have been developed to address the issue of limited energy reserve of the nodes in ad-hoc networks. We consider the routing problem in MANET with the goal of maximizing the life time of the network. We propose a distributed routing algorithm that reaches the optimal (centralized) solution to within an asymptotically small relative error. Our approach is based on the formulation of multicommodity flow, and it allows to consider different power consumption models and bandwidth constraints. It works for both static and slowly changing dynamic networks.},

pages={1108-1119 vol.2},
abstract={We show that the use of dynamic addressing can enable scalable routing in ad hoc networks. It is well known that the current ad hoc protocol suites do not scale to work efficiently in networks of more than a few hundred nodes. Most current ad hoc routing architectures use flat static addressing and thus, need to keep track of each node individually, creating a massive overhead problem as the network grows. Could dynamic addressing alleviate this problem? To begin to answer this question, we provide an initial design of a routing layer based on dynamic addressing, and evaluate its performance. Each node has a unique permanent identifier and a transient routing address, which indicates its location in the network at any given time. The main challenge is dynamic address allocation in the face of node mobility. We propose mechanisms to implement dynamic addressing efficiently. Our initial evaluation suggests that dynamic addressing is a promising approach for achieving scalable routing in meganode ad hoc networks.},

pages={1120-1125 vol.2},
abstract={Multi-path routing has been studied thoroughly in the context of wired networks. Ii has been shown that using multiple paths to route messages between any source-destination pair of nodes (instead of using a single path) balances the load more evenly throughout the network. The common belief is that the same is true for ad hoc networks, i.e., multi-path routing balances the load significantly better than single-path routing. We show that this is not necessarily the case. We introduce a new model for evaluating the load balance under multi-path routing, when the paths chosen are the first K shortest paths (for a pre-specified K). Using this model, we show that unless we use a very large number of paths (which is very costly and therefore infeasible) the load distribution is almost the same as single shortest path routing. This is in contrary to the previous existing results which assume that multi-path routing distributes the load uniformly.},

pages={1126-1134 vol.2},
abstract={We consider a type of on-line, traffic scheduling problem in input queued, crossbar switches. The input to a problem, at each time step, is a set of desired traffic rates. These traffic rates in general cannot be exactly achieved since they assume arbitrarily small fractions of packets can be transmitted at each time step. The goal of the traffic scheduling problem is to closely approximate the given sequence of traffic rates by a sequence of switch uses in which only whole packets are sent. The focus of this paper is bounding the costs incurred in using such an approximation, in terms of the additional buffer size required. We establish universal bounds on the additional buffer size due to sending only whole packets; these bounds do not depend on the particular distribution of the input traffic, require no speedup, and guarantee 100% throughput. Specifically, for an N /spl times/ N input queued, crossbar switch, an on-line, packetizing algorithm is presented that guarantees 100% throughput with a buffer requirement of (N + 1)/sup 2//4 packets per input port with no speedup. The algorithm can he improved to run in O(N log N) time, using a fast algorithm for edge-coloring bipartite multigraphs. In the reverse direction, it is shown for an N /spl times/ N input queued, crossbar switch, that any on-line, packetizing algorithm with no speedup requires a buffer size of N/e - 2 packets per input port. We also extend the main packetizing algorithm in this paper to a general class of switch architectures.},

abstract={We show that the multiple input/output-queued (MlOQ) switch proposed in our previous paper H. I. Lee and S. W. Seo (May 2003) can emulate an output-queued switch only with two parallel switches. The MIOQ switch requires no speedup and provides an exact emulation of an output-queued switch with a broad class of service scheduling algorithms including FIFO, weighted fair queueing (WFQ) and strict priority queueing regardless of incoming traffic pattern and switch size. First, we show that an N /spl times/ N MIOQ switch with a (2, 2)-dimensional crossbar fabric can exactly emulate an N /spl times/ N output-queued switch. For this purpose, we propose the stable strategic alliance (SSA) algorithm that can produce a stable many-to-many assignment, and then apply it to the scheduling of an MIOQ switch. Next, we prove that a (2, 2)-dimensional crossbar fabric can be implemented by two N /spl times/ N crossbar switches in parallel for an N /spl times/ N MIOQ switch. For a proper operation of two crossbar switches in parallel, each input-output pair matched by the SSA algorithm must be mapped to one of two crossbar switches. For this mapping, we propose a simple algorithm that requires at most 2N steps for all matched input-output pairs. In addition, to relieve the implementation burden of N input buffers being accessed simultaneously, we propose a buffering scheme called redundant buffering which requires two memory devices instead of N physically-separate memories.},

abstract={We propose a novel framework to solve the problem of scheduling packets in high-speed input-queued switches with frame-based control.

These findings allows us to state that our SSB scheduling policy achieves 100% throughput both in isolated input-queued switches arid in networks of input-queued switches. Simulation results are used to further validate the approach and to show its flexibility in dealing with differentiated QoS guarantees.},

abstract={We consider the (generalized) packet switch scheduling problem, where the switch service configuration has to be dynamically chosen based on observed queue backlogs, so as to maximize the throughput. A class of recently developed 'projective' scheduling algorithms, which substantially generalize the well-known maximum weight matching (MWM) algorithms for crossbar switches, are explored from the perspective of complexity. The typically huge number of possible switch configurations that the scheduler has to consider in each timeslot has been previously observed to lead to an impractical computational requirement. We introduce a new class of projective schedules based on 'local search' concepts. In particular, rather than searching the entire (typically huge) set of available service configurations to find the best one, the new scalable scheduling algorithms search 'locally' over a small neighborhood of service configurations to find a 'better' one in each time slot. We show that local projective scheduling algorithms can provide dramatic reduction in complexity without causing any loss of throughput (although they may observe higher delay). We explore the nature and structure of such schedules, which show a much higher promise for practical implementation than their global versions.},

abstract={Next generation networks (NGN) and the migration towards IP networks is likely to make the IP technology the main vehicle for earning voice and video calls on modern networks. Packet dispersion is a mechanism by which the packets of a certain session are dispersed over multiple paths, in contrast to the traditional approach by which they follow a single path most of the time. In this work we examine the quality of voice over IP (VoIP) applications and the effects of packet dispersion on it. We focus on the effect of the network loss on the applications, where we propose to use noticeable loss rate (NLR) as a measure correlated with the voice quality. We analyze the NLR for various packet dispersion strategies over paths experiencing memory-less (Bernoulli) or bursty (Gilbert model) losses, and compare them to each other. Our analysis reveals, that in many situations, in particular for most cases where losses are bursty, the use of packet dispersion reduces the NLR and thus improves session quality. The results suggest that the use of packet dispersion can be quite beneficial for these applications.},

abstract={Rate control is an important issue in video streaming applications for both wired and wireless networks. A widely accepted rate control method in wired networks is equation based rate control (Sally Floyd et al., Aug. 2000), in which the TCP friendly rate is determined as a function of packet loss rate, round trip time and packet size. This approach, also known as TFRC, assumes that packet loss in wired networks is primarily due to congestion, and as such is not applicable to wireless networks in which the bulk of packet loss is due to error at the physical layer. We propose multiple TFRC connections as an end-to-end rate control solution for wireless video streaming. We show that this approach not only avoids modifications to the network infrastructure or network protocol, hut also results in full utilization of the wireless channel. NS-2 simulations and experiments over 1/spl times/RTT CDMA wireless data network are carried out to validate, and characterize the performance of our proposed approach.},

The other endpoints could be using any of the signaling protocols. The endpoint is registered to a media gateway controller, SIP server and a H.323 gatekeeper, possibly with the same number. The details of the design including the state machines of the different call control modules are described. The advantage of such architecture is reduced delay in call setup between two endpoints that otherwise use different signaling protocols. The architecture has been implemented and verified on one of the company's IP phone chip, which has an ARM7 and a DSF core. An example of a simple handling of a second call from a different protocol endpoint, when the first call is in progress, has also been given.},

abstract={We provide a sub-channel partitioning based unequal error protection (UEP) scheme for a space-time block coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (STBC-OFDM) system. In such a scheme, video data is partitioned into high-priority (HP) and low-priority (LP) layers according to the importance of the data. At the receiver side, OFDM sub-channels are partitioned into high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) groups according to the estimated channel qualities. Based on the feedback of sub-channel partitioning results, the transmitter assigns HP and LP video data to the corresponding HQ and LQ sub-channels. Through theoretical analysis, we show there is indeed a significant BER difference between the HQ and LQ sub-channels, which can be exploited by UEP. Based on the analysis, we provide a criterion for determining the appropriate transmission power. Through computer simulations, we show that the proposed scheme offers significant performance gain compared to conventional methods. We also demonstrate that the scheme is the least sensitive to channel estimation errors among all compared schemes, and is hardly influenced by the Doppler spread. The feedback overhead can also be reduced with almost no performance penalty by bundling several neighboring sub-channels together and assigning them to the same group.},

abstract={This work describes a method of interconnecting links that combines the advantages of bridging and routing. The basic design is a replacement for a transparent bridge and makes no assumption about higher layer protocols. It involves creating an infrastructure of switches (which we call Rbridges, for "routing bridges") in which packets are routed, although, as with bridges, layer 2 end code location is learned through receipt of data packets. It avoids the disadvantages of bridges, since packets within the infrastructure need not be confined to a spanning tree, and packets are protected with a hop count and not proliferated while in transit, so there is no need for any artificial startup delay on ports to avoid temporary loops. This allows IP nodes to travel within a multi-link campus without changing IP addresses. The paper introduces further optimizations for IP, such as avoiding hooding ARP messages through the infrastructure, and (for IP nodes), allowing Rbridges to avoid learning on data packets.},

abstract={Web clusters continue to be widely used by large enterprises and organizations to host online services. Providing services without interruption is critical to the revenue and perceived image of both hosts and content providers. Therefore, server node failure and recovery should be invisible to the clients. Most of the existing fault-tolerance schemes simply stop dispatching future client requests to the failed server. They do not recover those connections handled by the node at the time of failure, which makes the failure visible to some clients. Making the failure transparent requires both application-layer and transport-layer mechanisms. While atomic application-layer primary-backup failover schemes have been addressed at length in previous literature, a transport-layer scheme is necessary in order to make them invisible to the clients. We describe a transparent TCP connection failover mechanism. Besides transparency, our solution is also highly efficient, and does not need any dedicated hardware support.},

abstract={We present a framework for providing fair service and supporting QoS requirements in IEEE 802.11 networks with multiple access-points (APs). These issues becomes critical as IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN are widely deployed in nationwide networks, linking tens of thousands of "hot-spots" for providing both real-time (voice) and non real-time (data) services to a large population of mobile users. However, both fairness and QoS guarantees cannot he supported in the current 802.11 standard. Our system, termed MiFi, relies on centralized coordination of the APs. During any given time of the "contention-free" period only a set of non-interfering APs is activated while the others are silenced. Moreover the amount of service granted to an AP is proportional to its load and the system's performance is optimized by employing efficient scheduling algorithms. We show that such a system can be implemented without requiring any modification of the underlying MAC protocol standard or the behavior of the mobile stations and it guarantees to overcome the hidden node and the overlapping cell problems. Our simulations establish that the system supports fairness and hence can provide QoS guarantees for real-time traffic, while maintaining a relative high till throughput.},

One emerging theme is the replacement of dedicated lines based on frame relay or ISDN technologies with multiple inexpensive ADSL/cable TV links each of which potentially is subscribed from a different ISP. The key enabling technology for this revolution is multihoming load balancing, which spreads an enterprise's Internet traffic among multiple access links to increase the aggregate throughput, and diverts traffic away from non-functional links when they fail. Although there exist several commercial multihoming load balancing products in the marketplace, very little is published about the design tradeoffs and their performance implications. We describe the design space of multihoming load balancing systems, discuss the tradeoffs involved in load balancing and fail-over implementation strategies, and present quantitative performance measurements collected on a commercial multihoming load balancing system.},

abstract={Bluetooth is a promising wireless technology aiming at supporting electronic devices to be instantly interconnected into short-range ad hoc networks. The Bluetooth medium access control protocol is based on the master/slave concept wherein any communication between slave devices has to go through the master. While this model is simple, it incurs longer delay between any two slave devices due to the use of non-optimal packet forwarding scheme and the use of double the bandwidth at the master. Moreover, if more than two devices want to communicate as a group, this can only be achieved by either multiple unicast transmissions or a piconet-wide broadcast from the master. To handle these issues efficiently, we propose a novel combination of dynamic slot assignment (DSA) and piconet partitioning. With DSA, the piconet master dynamically assigns slots to slaves so as to allow them to communicate directly with each other without any intervention from the master. Such proposed communication architecture provides for quality of service (QoS) requests, admission control, and multi-device conversation by which a multicast-like communication is feasible within a piconet. To widen the scope of DSA, we propose QoS-driven enhanced DSA (EDSA) where dynamic piconet partitioning and scatternet support comes into picture. Devices are grouped in piconets according to their connection endpoints in EDSA, enabling it to be employed over a scatternet. We have performed extensive simulations and observe that these schemes drastically enhance Bluetooth performance in terms of delay and throughput, while significantly reducing network power consumption.},

abstract={This work discusses the energy efficient QoS topology control problem in ad hoc wireless networks. Given a set of nodes in a plane, end-to-end traffic demands and delay bounds between node pairs, the problem is to find a network topology that can meet the QoS requirements and the maximum transmitting power of nodes is minimized. We consider two cases of the problem: 1) the traffic demands are not splittable, and 2) the traffic demands are splittable. For the former case, the problem is formulated as an integer linear programming problem. For the latter case, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem, and an optimal algorithm has been proposed to solve the problem.},

abstract={Due to the salient characteristics such as the time-varying and error-prone wireless links, the dynamic and limited bandwidth, the time-varying traffic pattern and user locations, and the energy constraints, it is a challenging task to efficiently support heterogeneous traffic with different quality of service (QoS) requirements in mulithop mobile ad hoc networks. In the last few years, many channel dependent mechanisms are proposed to address this issue based on the cross-layer design philosophy. However, a lot of problems remain before more efficient solutions are found. One of the problems is how to alleviate the conflict between throughput and fairness for different prioritized traffic, especially how to avoid the bandwidth starvation problem for low priority traffic when the high priority traffic load is very high. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme named courtesy piggybacking (CP) to address this problem. With the recognition of inter-layer coupling, our courtesy piggybacking scheme exploits the channel dynamics and stochastic traffic features to alleviate the conflict. The basic idea is to let the high priority traffic help the low priority traffic by sharing unused residual bandwidth with courtesy. Another noteworthy feature of the proposed scheme is its implementation simplicity: the scheme is easy to implement and is applicable in networks using either reservation-based or contention-based MAC protocols.},

abstract={This paper examines the theoretical aspects of bandwidth sharing in wireless, possibly mobile, ad-hoc networks (MANETs) through a game theoretic framework. It presents some applications to show how such a framework can be invoked to design efficient media access control protocols in a noncooperative, self-organized, topology-blind environment as well as in environments where the competing nodes share some basic information to guide their choice of channel access policies. For this purpose, contentions between concurrent links in a MANET are represented by a conflict graph, and each maximal clique in the graph defines a contention context which in turn imposes a constraint on the share of bandwidth that the links in the clique can obtain. Using this approach the fair bandwidth allocation problem is modeled as a general utility based constrained maximization problem, called the system problem, which is shown to admit a unique solution that can only be obtained when global coordination between all links is possible. By using Lagrange relaxation and duality theory, both a non-cooperative and a cooperative game formulation of the problem are derived. The corresponding mathematical algorithms to solve the two games are also provided where there is no need for global information. Implementation issues of the algorithms are also considered. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.},

abstract={Many group communications require a security infrastructure that ensures multiple levels of access privilege for group members. Access control in hierarchy is prevalent in multimedia applications, which consist of users that subscribe to different quality levels or different sets of data streams. We present a multi-group key management scheme that achieves such a hierarchical access control by employing an integrated key graph and by managing group keys for all users with various access privileges. Compared with applying existing tree-based group key management schemes directly to the hierarchical access control problem, the proposed scheme significantly reduces the communication, computation and storage overhead associated with key management and achieves better scalability when the number of access levels increases. In addition, the proposed key graph is suitable for both centralized and contributory environments.},

abstract={In secure multicast communications, key management schemes are employed to prevent unauthorized access to multicast content. Key management, however, can disclose the information about the dynamics of the group membership, such as the group size and the number of join and departure users, to both inside and outside attackers. This is a threat to applications with confidential group membership information. This paper investigates attack/anti-attack strategies for stealing/protecting group dynamic information in the existing key management schemes. We show that attackers can successfully acquire the membership information by exploiting the key updating procedure in popular centralized key management schemes. Particularly, we develop two attack strategies and demonstrate their effectiveness through simulations. Further, we propose an anti-attack technique utilizing hatch rekeying and phantom users, and derive performance criteria that describe the security level of the proposed scheme using mutual information. The proposed anti-attack scheme is evaluated based on the data obtained from real MBone sessions.},

We explore several networking scenarios - some simplistic, others more realistic - and analyze the resulting Nash equilibrium graphs with respect to topology, performance, and resilience. We find a fundamental tradeoff between performance and resilience, and show that limiting the degree of nodes is of great importance in controlling this balance. Further, by varying the cost function, the game produces widely different topologies; one parameter in particular - the relative cost between maintaining an overlay link and increasing the path length to other nodes - can generate topologies with node-degree distributions whose tails vary from exponential to power-law. We conclude that competitive games can create overlay routing networks satisfying very diverse goals.},

abstract={We study the benefits of using tunable transceivers for reducing the required number of electronic ports in WDM/TDM networks. We show that such transceivers can be used to efficiently "groom" sub-wavelength traffic in the optical domain and so can significantly reduce the number of electronic ports compared to the fixed tuned case. We provide a new formulation for this "tunable grooming" problem. We show that in general this problem is NP-complete, but we are able to efficiently solve it for many cases of interest. When the number of wavelengths in the network is not limited, we show that each node only needs the minimum number of transceivers (i.e., no more transceivers than the amount of traffic that it generates). This holds regardless of the network topology or traffic pattern. When the number of wavelengths is limited, we show an analogous result for both uniform and hub traffic in a ring. We also develop a heuristic algorithm for general traffic that uses nearly the minimum number of transceivers. In most cases, tunable transceivers are shown to reduce the number of ports per node by as much as 60%.},

abstract={Constructing wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) switches with cheap components and low complexity is an important problem in optical networking. Typically, there are two request models widely considered. In one model, a connection request asks to go from a wavelength on an input finer of the WDM switch to a particular wavelength on an output fiber. In the other, a connection only needs to get to a particular output fiber, irrespective of what wavelength it will be on. We give novel constructions of strictly nonblocking and rearrangeably nonblocking WDM switches for both request models using limited range wavelength converters and arrayed waveguide grating routers. We fully analyze their blocking characteristics. Our designs are all relatively simple and easy to be laid out, and are useful for both optical circuit-switching and optical packet/burst switching. As far as we know, these are the first of such constructions.},

Given that wavelength converters nowadays remain very expensive, how to make effective use of a limited number of wavelength converters becomes an important issue. We propose sparse-partial wavelength conversion (SPWC) network architecture with the inherent flexibility that can facilitate network carriers to migrate the optical backbone to support wavelength conversion. We demonstrate that this network architecture can significantly save the number of wavelength converters, yet achieving excellent blocking performance. Theoretical and simulation results indicate that, the performance of a wavelength-routed WDM network with only 1-5%of wavelength conversion capability is very close to that with full-complete wavelength conversion capability.},

abstract={Wireless local area networks (WLANs) based on the IEEE 802.11 technology are becoming increasingly popular and widely deployed. However, the growing need for quality of service (QoS) guarantees is difficult to implement in distributed systems like WLANs, where the random access protocol and the unpredictability of the wireless channel hamper their interaction with well-established architectures like DiffServ. Even without trying to provide deterministic QoS guarantees, simpler requirements are hard to get by. For example, the basic requirement of providing fair access to all users is conflicting with the nature of higher-layer protocols: TCP is fair only under certain conditions, hardly met by 802.11b WLANs. Another basic requirement is the protection for short-lived TCP flows, that are sensitive to losses during the early stages of the TCP window growth. The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of an LLC-layer algorithm that can be implemented at both access point (AP) and wireless stations (WSs). The algorithm aims at guaranteeing fair access to the medium to every user, by awarding longer transmission opportunities to WSs that experienced short channel failures. At the same time, such award mechanism can protect short-lived flows while they strive to get past the critical "small window regime". We outline the proposed solution and present a simulation study that shows the effectiveness of the new algorithm in comparison to the standard 802.11b implementation.},

abstract={Many studies show that the wireless network interface (WNI) accounts for a significant part of the power consumed by mobile terminals. Thus, putting the WNI into sleep when it is idle is an effective technique to save power. To support streaming applications, existing techniques cannot put the WNI into sleep due to strict delay requirements. We present a novel power-aware and QoS-aware service model over wireless networks. In the proposed model, mobile terminals use proxies to buffer data so that the WNIs can sleep for a long time period. To achieve power-aware communication while satisfying the delay requirement of each flow, a scheduling scheme, called priority-based bulk scheduling (PBS), is designed to decide which flow should be served at which time. Through analysis, we prove that the PBS service model can provide delay assurance and achieve power efficiency. We use audio-on-demand and Web access as case studies to evaluate the performance of the PBS service model. Experimental results show that PBS achieves excellent QoS provision for each flow and significantly reduces the power consumption.},

The model is also extended for ongoing proposals under consideration for 802.11e wherein a number of packets may be transmitted in a burst once the channel is accessed.

abstract={Location is an important feature for many applications, and wireless networks can better serve their clients by anticipating client mobility. As a result, many location predictors have been proposed in the literature, though few have been evaluated with empirical evidence. This paper reports on the results of the first extensive empirical evaluation of location predictors, using a two-year trace of the mobility patterns of over 6,000 users on Dartmouth's campus-wide Wi-Fi wireless network. We implemented and compared the prediction accuracy of several location predictors drawn from two major families of domain-independent predictors, namely Markov-based and compression-based predictors. We found that low-order Markov predictors performed as well or better than the more complex and more space-consuming compression-based predictors. Predictors of both families fail to make a prediction when the recent context has not been previously seen. To overcome this drawback, we added a simple fallback feature to each predictor and found that it significantly enhanced its accuracy in exchange for modest effort. Thus the Order-2 Markov predictor with fallback was the best predictor we studied, obtaining a median accuracy of about 72% for users with long trace lengths. We also investigated a simplification of the Markov predictors, where the prediction is based not on the most frequently seen context in the past, but the most recent, resulting in significant space and computational savings. We found that Markov predictors with this recency semantics can rival the accuracy of standard Markov predictors in some cases. Finally, we considered several seemingly obvious enhancements, such as smarter tie-breaking and aging of context information, and discovered that they had little effect on accuracy. The paper ends with a discussion and suggestions for further work.},

pages={1425-1436 vol.2},
abstract={We study the impact of individual variable-range transmission power control on the physical and network connectivity, network capacity and power savings of wireless multihop networks such as ad hoc and sensor networks. First, using previous work by Steele (1988) and Gupta (2000) we derive an asymptotic expression for the average traffic carrying capacity of nodes in a multihop network where nodes can individually control the transmission range they use. For the case of a path attenuation factor /spl alpha/ = 2 we show that this capacity remains constant even when more nodes are added to the network. Second, we show that the ratio between the minimum transmission range levels obtained using common-range and variable-range based routing protocols is approximately 2. This is an important result because it suggests that traditional routing protocols based on common-range transmission can only achieve about half the traffic carrying capacity of variable-range power control approaches. In addition, common-range approaches consume /spl sim/ (1 $2/(2/sup /spl alpha//)) % more transmission power. Second, we derive a model that approximates the signaling overhead of a routing protocol as a function of the transmission range and node mobility for both route discovery and route maintenance. We show how routing protocols based on common-range transmission power limit the capacity available to mobile nodes. The results presented in the paper highlight the need to design future wireless network protocols (e.g., routing protocols) for wireless ad hoc and sensor networks based, not on common-range which is prevalent today, but on variable-range power control.},

However most wireless devices also transmit some control packets (such as RTS and CTS in 802.11) besides data packets.

We first propose more comprehensive energy consumption models that consider the energy consumption for data packets as well as control packets.

abstract={Efficient use of energy while providing an adequate level of connection to individual sessions is of paramount importance in multi-hop wireless networks. Energy efficiency and connection quality depend on mechanisms that span several communication layers due to the existing co-channel interference among competing flows that must reuse the limited radio spectrum. Although independent consideration of these layers simplifies the system design, it is often insufficient for wireless networks when the overall system performance is examined carefully. The multi-hop wireless extensions and the need for routing users' sessions from source to the destination only intensify this point of view. In this work, we present a framework for cross-layer design towards energy-efficient communication. Our approach is characterized by a synergy between the physical and the medium access control (MAC) layers with a view towards inclusion of higher layers as well. More specifically, we address the joint problem of power control and scheduling with the objective of minimizing the total transmit power subject to the end-to-end quality of service (QoS) guarantees for sessions in terms of their bandwidth and bit error rate guarantees. Bearing to the NP-hardness of this combinatorial optimization problem, we propose our heuristic solutions that follow greedy approaches.},

pages={1457-1466 vol.2},
abstract={With increasing interest in energy constrained multi-hop wireless networks (Bambos, N. et al., 1991), a fundamental problem is one of determining energy efficient communication strategies over these multi-hop networks. The simplest problem is one where a given source node wants to communicate with a given destination, with a given rate over a multi-hop wireless network, using minimum power. Here the power refers to the total amount of power consumed over the entire network in order to achieve this rate between the source and the destination. There are three decisions that have to be made (jointly) in order to minimize the power requirement. (1) The path(s) that the data has to take between the source and the destination. (Routing). (2) The power with each link transmission is done. (Power Control). (3) Depending on the interference or the MAC characteristics, the time slots in which specific link transmissions have to take place. (Scheduling). (4) To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to derive a performance guaranteed polynomial time approximation algorithm for jointly solving these three problems. We formulate the overall problem as an optimization problem with non-linear objective function and non-linear constraints. We then derive a polynomial time 3-approximation algorithm to solve this problem. We also present a simple version of the algorithm, with the same performance bound, which involves solving only shortest path problems and which is quite efficient in practice. Our approach readily extends to the case where there are multiple source-destination pairs that have to communicate simultaneously over the multi-hop network.},

abstract={We present the pulse protocol which is designed for multi-hop wireless infrastructure access. While similar to the more traditional access point model, it is extended to operate across multiple hops. This is particularly useful for conference, airport, or large corporate deployments. In these types of environments where users are highly mobile, energy efficiency becomes of great importance. The pulse protocol utilizes a periodic flood initiated at the network gateways which provides both routing and synchronization to the network. This synchronization is used to allow idle nodes to power off their radios for a large percentage of the time when they are not needed for packet forwarding. This results in substantial energy savings. Through simulation we validate the performance of the routing protocol with respect to both packet delivery and energy savings.},

pages={12},
abstract={Active queue management (AQM) is an effective method to enhance congestion control, and to achieve tradeoff between link utilization and delay. The de facto standard, random early detection (RED), and most of its variants use queue length as a congestion indicator to trigger packet dropping. The proportional-integral (PI), use both queue length and traffic input rate as congestion indicators; effective stability model and practical design rules built on the TCP control model and abstracted AQM model reveal that such schemes enhance the stability of a system. In this paper, we propose an AQM scheme with fast response time, yet good robustness. The scheme, called loss ratio based RED (LRED), measures the latest packet loss ratio, and uses it as a complement to queue length in order to dynamically adjust packet drop probability. Employing the closed-form relationship between packet loss ratio and the number of TCP flows, this scheme is responsive even if the number of TCP flows varies significantly. We also provide the design rules for this scheme based on the well-known TCP control model. This scheme's performance is examined under various network configurations, and compared to existing AQM schemes, including PI, random exponentially marking (REM), and adaptive virtual queue (AVQ). Our simulation results show that, with comparable complexity', this scheme has short response time, better robustness, and more desirable tradeoff than PI, REM, and AQV, especially under highly dynamic network and heavy traffic load.},

abstract={We consider the problem of applying aggregate congestion control to a class of distributed multimedia applications known as Cluster-to-Cluster (C-to-C) applications. Flows in such an application share a common intermediary path that is the primary source of network delay and packet loss. Using the Coordination Protocol (CP) architecture, we show how aggregate congestion control can be achieved with the following properties: Almost any rate-based, single-flow congestion control algorithm may be applied to make aggregate C-to-C traffic congestion responsive. C-to-C applications may use multiple flow bandwidth shares and still exhibit correct aggregate congestion responsiveness. C-to-C applications may implement complex, application-specific adaptation schemes in which the behavior of individual flows is decoupled from the behavior of the congestion responsive aggregate flow. Bandwidth filtered loss detection (BFLD) is presented as a technique for making single-flow loss detection algorithms work when aggregate traffic uses multiple flowshares. The approach is evaluated using both ns2 simulation and an experimental implementation in Free BSD and Linux. Results demonstrate its success for a wide range of network conditions.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the problem of distributively allocating transmission rates to users on the Internet. We allow users to have concave as well as sigmoidal utility functions that are natural in the context of various applications. In the literature, for simplicity, most works have dealt only with the concave case. However, we show that when applying rate control algorithms developed for concave utility functions in a more realistic setting (with both concave and sigmoidal types of utility functions), they could lead to instability and high network congestion. We show that a pricing based mechanism that solves the dual formulation can be developed based on the theory of subdifferentials with the property that the prices "self-regulate" the users to access the resource based on the net utility. We discuss convergence issues and show that an algorithm can be developed that is efficient in the sense of achieving the global optimum when there are many users.},

abstract={In this paper, we design a bandwidth pricing mechanism that solves congestion problems in communication networks. The scheme is based on second-price auctions, which are known to be incentive compatible when a single indivisible item is to he sold (users have no interest to lie about the price they are willing to pay for the resource) and to lead to an efficient allocation of resources in the sense that it maximizes social welfare. We prove these properties when an infinitely divisible resource (bandwidth on a communication link) is to he shared among users who are allowed to submit several bids when they want to establish a connection. Our scheme is highly related to the progressive second price auction of Lazar and Semret where players bid sequentially until an (optimal) equilibrium is reached. While keeping their incentive compatibility and efficiency properties, our scheme presents the advantage that the multibid is submitted once only, saving a lot of signalization overhead.},

abstract={In recent years, the notion of a service offering a degraded performance with respect to the best-effort service traditionally found in IP networks has gained acceptance among network researchers. Such a less-than-best-effort (LBE) service may he considered as another way of providing a differentiated quality of service, following A. Odlyzko's "damaged goods for the Internet" approach. In this paper we are interested in evaluating, from a pricing perspective, the implications of the two scheduling models commonly proposed for building a LBE service-namely, priority queueing and generalized processor sharing (GPS). In particular, we focus on the network operator's issue of maximizing her revenue. We wish to study, for each scheduler, how to set prices and, especially, the impact that a given queueing model may have on revenues when users are mostly sensitive to delay. Drawing on previous work by Mandjes (2003), we present analytical expressions of the revenue earned by the network operator, when a GPS scheduler is used. A comparison of optimal revenues shows that: (a) Priority Queueing is more efficient, in economic terms, than both a GPS scheduler and a simple FIFO queue, that is, a network with no service differentiation; (b) revenues are lower with a GPS scheduler than with a FIFO queue. These results may have implications both on the practical implementation of LBE services and on the Paris Metro Pricing proposal by Odlyzko (1999).},

abstract={Several recent price-based congestion control schemes require relatively accurate path price estimates for successful operation. The proposed addition of the two-bit explicit congestion notification (CCN) field in the IP header provides routers with a mechanism for conveying price information. Recently, two proposals have emerged for probabilistic packet marking at the routers; the proposals allow receivers to estimate path price from the fraction of marked packets. In this paper we introduce an alternative deterministic marking scheme for encoding path price. Under our approach, each router quantizes the price of its outgoing link to a fixed number of bits. We then make use of the IP identification (IPid) field to map data packets to different probe types, and each probe type calculates a partial sum of the path price bits. A router deduces its marking behaviour according to the IPid and the TTL (time to live) field of each packet. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm in terms of its error in representing the end-to-end price, and compare it to probabilistic marking. We show that based on empirical Internet traffic characteristics, our algorithm performs better when estimating path price using small blocks of packets. We also derive the probability distribution of the error for our scheme, and provide a relatively simple bound on its maximum mean-squared error.},

To this end, we have designed scalable mechanisms to distribute the game state to the participating players and to maintain consistency in the face of node failures. The resulting system dynamically scales with the number of online players. It is more flexible and has a lower deployment cost than centralized games servers. We have implemented a simple game we call SimMud, and experimented with up to 4000 players to demonstrate the applicability of this approach.},

abstract={Peer-to-peer networks are mainly unstructured, where no specific topology is imposed on the network during its operations. These networks offer a high degree of resilience against network dynamics disrupting the network's operation. Unstructured networks, based on random connections are limited, however, in the performance and node reachability they can offer to applications. In contrast, structured networks impose predetermined connectivity relationships between nodes in order to offer a guarantee on the diameter between requesting nodes and the requested objects. We observe that neither structured nor unstructured networks can simultaneously offer both good performance and resilience in a single algorithm. To address this challenge, we propose Phenix, a peer-to-peer algorithm that can construct low-diameter resilient topologies. Phenix supports low diameter operations by creating a topology of nodes whose degree distribution follows a power-law, while the implementation of the underlying algorithm is fully distributed requiring no central server, thus, eliminating the possibility of a single point of failure in the system. We present the design and evaluation of the algorithm and show through analysis, simulation, and experimental results obtained from an implementation on the PlanetLab testbed that Phenix is robust to network dynamics such as joins/leaves, node failure and large-scale network attacks, while maintaining low overhead when implemented in an experimental network.},

abstract={We quantify the effectiveness of random walks for searching and construction of unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. We have identified two cases where the use of random walks for searching achieves better results than flooding: a) when the overlay topology is clustered, and h) when a client re-issues the same query while its horizon does not change much. For construction, we argue that an expander can he maintained dynamically with constant operations per addition. The key technical ingredient of our approach is a deep result of stochastic processes indicating that samples taken from consecutive steps of a random walk can achieve statistical properties similar to independent sampling (if the second eigenvalue of the transition matrix is hounded away from 1, which translates to good expansion of the network; such connectivity is desired, and believed to hold, in every reasonable network and network model). This property has been previously used in complexity theory for construction of pseudorandom number generators. We reveal another facet of this theory and translate savings in random bits to savings in processing overhead.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the design of a physical network topology that meets a high level of reliability using unreliable network elements. We are motivated by the use of networks, and in particular, all-optical networks, for high-reliability applications which involve unusual and catastrophic stresses. Our network model is one in which nodes are invulnerable and links are subject to failure, and we consider both statistically independent and dependent link failures. Our reliability metrics are the all-terminal connectedness measure and the less commonly considered two-terminal connectedness measure. We compare in the low and high stress regimes, via analytical approximations and simulations, common commercial architectures designed for all-terminal reliability when links are very reliable with alternative architectures which are mindful of both of our reliability metrics and regimes of stress. Furthermore, we show that for independent link failures network design should be optimized with respect to reliability under high stress, as reliability under low stress is less sensitive to graph structure; and that under high stress, very high node degrees are required to achieve moderate reliability performance. Finally, in our discussion of correlated failure models we show the danger in relying on an independent failure model and the need for the network architect to minimize component failure dependencies.},

abstract={We study the problem of shared path protection in optical networks from the viewpoint of blocking probability minimization. Unlike the worst-case approach common in other studies, which typically deals with one failure at a time and requires recomputation of the protection paths after every failure, our framework assumes a fixed path protection strategy for every connection that does not change in response to failures in other connections, which is more realistic for networks with high failure rates. We study backup-path strategy configurations that minimize the blocking probability and derive various properties. We show that configurations which do not have partial overlaps among connections backup paths are optimal in a rather general sense. We discuss the minmax optimal configuration properties and present an efficient algorithm for finding it in a case of special interest, while showing it to be NP-hard in general. In addition, we discuss the properties of the game resulting if each connection chooses its backup path selfishly; we show it to belong to the class of potential games, well-studied in the game theory literature, and derive several further properties resulting from its specific structure.},

abstract={Supporting fast restoration for general mesh topologies with minimal network over build is a technically challenging problem. Traditionally, ring based SONET networks have offered 50 ms restoration at the cost of requiring 100% over-build. Recently, fast (local) reroute has gained momentum in the context of MPLS networks. Fast reroute, when combined with preprovisioning of protection capacities and bypass tunnels, comes close to providing fast restoration for mesh networks. Preprovisioning has the additional advantage of greatly simplifying network routing and signaling. Thus even for protected connections, online routing can now be oblivious to the offered protection, and may only involve single shortest path computations. In this paper we are interested in the problem of reserving the least amount of the network capacity for protection, while guaranteeing fast restoration to all the supported connections. We show that the problem is NP-complete, and we present efficient approximation algorithms for the problem. These guarantees are provided even when the protection is for multiple link failures. In addition, the total amount of protection capacity reserved by these algorithms is just a small fraction of the amount reserved by existing ring-based schemes (e.g. SONET), especially on dense networks. The presented algorithms are computationally efficient, and can even be implemented on the network elements. Our simulation on some standard core networks, show that our algorithms work well in practice as well.},

abstract={This paper addresses the issue of reliable transport of emerging data services in Ethernet over SONET (EoS) networks that require protection guarantees beyond standard best effort delivery. We argue that the current consensus of using Ethernet spanning tree and a SONET 1+1 protection, while providing reliability, is an inefficient use of resources. Instead, we claim that EoS opens novel opportunities for protection heretofore unavailable in other environments. In particular, the deployment of virtual concatenation and LCAS protocols enables "route splitting", creating a fundamentally new routing paradigm for circuit-switched environments. We propose a scheme called PESO, appropriate for EoS, with innovative routing, failure notification and switching components. More importantly, it is competitive with SONET protection without its 100% bandwidth overhead. We also suggest a enhancement in LCAS that can further improve PESO'S switching time. PESO leverages the underlying protocols, making it extremely attractive to implement and use in practice.},

abstract={Dealing with network failures effectively is a major operational challenge for Internet service providers. Commonly deployed link state routing protocols such as OSPF react to link failures through global (i.e., network-wide) link state advertisements and routing table recomputations, causing significant forwarding discontinuity after a failure. The drawback with these protocols is that they need to trade off routing stability and forwarding continuity. To improve failure resiliency without jeopardizing routing stability, we propose a proactive local rerouting based approach called failure insensitive routing (FIR). The proposed approach prepares for failures using interface-specific forwarding, and upon a failure, suppresses the link state advertisement and instead triggers local rerouting using a backwarding table. In this paper, we prove that when no more than one link failure notification is suppressed, FIR always finds a loop-free path to a destination if one such path exists. We also formally analyze routing stability and network availability under both proactive and reactive approaches, and show that FIR provides better stability and availability than OSPF.},

abstract={The Thorup-Zwick (TZ) compact routing scheme is the first generic stretch-3 routing scheme delivering a nearly optimal per-node memory upper bound. Using both direct analysis and simulation, we derive the stretch distribution of this routing scheme on Internet-like inter-domain topologies. By investigating the TZ scheme on random graphs with power-law node degree distributions, P/sub k//spl sime/k/sup -/spl gamma//, we find that the average TZ stretch is quite low and virtually independent of /spl gamma/. In particular, for the Internet inter-domain graph with /spl gamma//spl sime/2.1, the average TZ stretch is around 1.1, with up to 70% of all pairwise paths being stretch-1 (shortest possible). As the network grows, the average stretch slowly decreases. We find routing table sizes to be very small (around 50 records for 104-node networks), well below their theoretical upper bounds. Furthermore, we find that both the average shortest path length (i.e. distance) d~ and width of the distance distribution /spl sigma/ observed in the real Internet inter-AS graph have values that are very close to the minimums of the average stretch in the d~- and /spl sigma/ -directions. This leads us to the discovery of a unique critical point of the average TZ stretch as a function of d~ and /spl sigma/. The Internet's distance distribution is located in a close neighborhood of this point. This is remarkable given the fact that the Internet inter-domain topology has evolved without any direct attention paid to properties of the stretch distribution. It suggests the average stretch function may be an indirect indicator of the optimization criteria influencing the Internet's inter-domain topology evolution.},

In this work, we develop a Markov model of a sensor network whose nodes may enter a sleep mode, and we use this model to investigate the system performance in terms of energy consumption, network capacity, and data deliver delay. Furthermore, the proposed model enables us to investigate the trade-offs existing between these performance metrics and the sensor dynamics in sleep/active mode.

abstract={We study the problem of scheduling packet transmissions for data gathering in wireless sensor networks. The focus is to explore the energy-latency tradeoffs in wireless communication using techniques such as modulation scaling. The data aggregation tree - a multiple-source single-sink communication paradigm - is employed for abstracting the packet flow. We consider a real-time scenario where the data gathering must be performed within a specified latency constraint. We present algorithms to minimize the overall energy dissipation of the sensor nodes in the aggregation tree subject to the latency constraint. For the off-line problem, we propose (a) a numerical algorithm for the optimal solution, and (h) a pseudo-polynomial time approximation algorithm based on dynamic programming. We also discuss techniques for handling interference among the sensor nodes. Simulations have been conducted for both long-range communication and short-range communication. The simulation results show that compared with the classic shutdown technique, between 20% to 90% energy savings can be achieved by our techniques, under different settings of several key system parameters. We also develop an on-line distributed protocol that relies only on the local information available at each sensor node within the aggregation tree. Simulation results show that between 15% to 90% energy conservation can be achieved by the on-line protocol. The adaptability of the protocol with respect to variations in the packet size and latency constraint is also demonstrated through several run-time scenarios.},

abstract={To support real-time multimedia services in UMTS all-IP network, 3GPP TR 25.936 proposed two approaches to support real-time serving radio network controller (SRNC) switching, which require packet duplication during SRNC relocation. These approaches significantly consume extra system resources. This paper proposes the fast SRNC relocation (FSR) approach that does not duplicate packets. In FSR, a packet buffering mechanism is implemented to avoid packet loss at the target RNC. We propose an analytic model to investigate the performance of FSR. The numerical results show that packet loss at the source RNC can be ignored. Furthermore, the expected number of packets buffered at the target RNC is small, which does not prolong packet delay.},

abstract={An information-theoretic framework is developed for optimal location management in multisystem, fourth generation (4G) wireless networks. The framework envisions that each individual subsystem operates fairly independently, and does not require public knowledge of individual subnetwork topologies. To capture the variation in paging and location update costs in this heterogeneous environment, the location management problem is formulated in terms of a new concept of weighted entropy. The update process is based on the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithms, which are applied to a vector-valued sequence consisting of both the mobile's movement pattern and its session activity state. Three different tracking strategies which differ in their degrees of centralized control and provide trade off between the location update and paging costs, are proposed and evaluated. While both the proposed centralized and distributed location management strategies are endowed with optimal update capability, the proposed selective location management heuristic also offers a practical trade off between update and paging costs. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed schemes can result in more than 50% savings in both update and paging costs, in comparison with the basic movement-based, multisystem location management strategy. These update strategies can be realized with only modest amounts of memory (12-15 Kbytes) on the mobile.},

abstract={Global positioning systems (GPS) and mobile phone networks are making it possible to track individual users with an increasing accuracy. It is natural to ask whether one can use this information to maintain social networks. Here each user wishes to be informed whenever one of a list of other users, called the user's friends, appears in the user's vicinity. In contrast to more traditional positioning based algorithms, the computation here depends not only on the user's own position on a static map, but also on the dynamic position of the user's friends. Hence it requires both communication and computation resources. The computation can be carried out either between the individual users in a peer-to-peer fashion or by centralized servers where computation and data can be collected at one central location. In the peer-to-peer model, a novel algorithm for minimizing the number of location update messages between pairs of friends is presented. We also present an efficient algorithm for the centralized model, based on region hierarchy and quadtrees. The paper provides an analysis of the two algorithms, compares them with a naive approach, and evaluates them using the IBM city simulator system.},

abstract={The issue of tracking a group of users is discussed in this study. Given the condition that the search is over only after all the users in the group are found, this problem is called the conference call search (CCS) problem. The goal is to design efficient CCS strategies under delay and bandwidth constraints. While the problem of tracking a single user has been addressed by many studies, to the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to reduce the search cost for multiple users. Moreover, as oppose to the single user tracking, for which one can always reduce the expected search delay by increasing the expected search cost, for a multiple users search the dependency between the delay and the search cost is more complicated, as demonstrated in this study. We identify the key factors affecting the search efficiency, and the dependency between them and the search delay. Our analysis shows that under tight bandwidth constraints, the CCS problem is NP-hard. We therefore propose a search method that is not optimal, but has a low computational complexity. In addition, the proposed strategy yields a low search delay as well as a low search cost. The performance of the proposed search strategy is superior to the implementation of an optimal single user search on a group of users.},

abstract={Mobile IP is one of the dominating protocols that provide the mobility support in the Internet. However, even with some proposed optimization techniques, there is still space for improving the performance. In this paper, we present a novel mailbox-based scheme to further improve the performance. In this scheme, each mobile node migrating to a foreign network is associated with a mailbox. A sender sends packets to the receiver's mailbox, which will in turn forward them to the destination. During handoff, a mobile node can decide whether to move its mailbox and report the handoff to the home agent, or simply to report the handoff to the mailbox. In this way, the scheme is adaptive and can be made to reduce the workload on the home agent and minimize the total cost of message delivery and mobility management. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we develop a performance model considering two walk models for mobile nodes, based on which the cost function is derived. We also propose an iterative algorithm for deriving an optimal point where the cost function reaches its minimum. The results show that our new scheme can outperform mobile IP route optimization with smooth handoff extension, no matter how many packets are to be received during each migration.},

abstract={This paper investigates a new load balancing scheme for mobile networks that changes cellular coverage according to the geographic traffic distribution in real time. The performance of the whole cellular network is improved by contracting the antenna pattern around a traffic "hot spot" and expanding adjacent cells coverage to fill in the coverage loss. This is essentially a constrained multidimensional optimization problem. A novel bubble oscillation algorithm is proposed to address this problem. Any unserved traffic in the network is absorbed by the geographic load balancing in a similar way that a vacuum between bubbles is filled by bubble oscillations. Simulations have been performed to evaluate the system performance for different traffic scenarios, and the results are presented. Some discussions on this algorithm are also presented. The bubble oscillation algorithm described has the potential of being used in other similar multidimensional resource allocation problems.},

abstract={We study an efficient broadcast scheme in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The objective is to determine a small set of forward nodes to ensure full coverage. We first study several methods to select a small forward node set assuming that the neighborhood information can be updated in a timely manner. Then we consider a general case, where each node updates its neighborhood information based asynchronously on a predefined frequency and node move even during the broadcast process. The virtual network constructed from local views of nodes may not be connected, its links may not exist in the physical network, and the global view constructed from collection of local views may not be consistent. In this paper, we first give a sufficient condition for connectivity at the physical network to ensure the connectivity at the virtual network. We then propose a solution using two transmission ranges to address the link availability issue. The neighborhood information as well as the forward node set are determined based on a short transmission range while the broadcast process is done on a long transmission range. The difference between these two ranges is based on the update frequency and the speed of node movement. Finally, we propose a mechanism called aggregated local view to ensure consistency of the global view. By these, we extend Wu and Dai's coverage condition for broadcasting in a network with mobile nodes. The simulation study is conducted to evaluate the coverage of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={User mobility in wireless data networks is increasing because of technological advances, and the desire for voice and multimedia applications. These applications, however, require fast handoffs between base stations to maintain the quality of the connections. Previous work on context transfer for fast handoffs has focused on reactive methods, i.e. the context transfer occurs after the mobile station has associated with the next base station or access router. In this paper, we describe the use of a novel and efficient data structure, neighbor graphs, which dynamically captures the mobility topology of a wireless network as a means for prepositioning the station's context ensuring that the station's context always remains one hop ahead. From experimental and simulation results, we find that the use of neighbor graphs reduces the layer 2 handoff latency due to reassociation by an order of magnitude from 15.37ms to 1.69ms, and that the effectiveness of the approach improves dramatically as user mobility increases.},

abstract={It was noted in recent years that the Internet structure resembles a star with a highly connected core and long stretched tendrils. In this work we present a new quantity, the Internet geometric curvature, that captures the above observation by a single number. We embed the Internet distance metric in a hyperbolic space with an optimal curvature and achieve an accuracy better than achieved before for the Euclidean space. This proves our hypothesis regarding the internet curvature. We demonstrate the strength of our embedding with two applications: selecting the closest server and building an application level multicast tree.},

abstract={We consider the problem of architecting a reliable content delivery system across an overlay network using TCP connections as the transport primitive. We first argue that natural designs based on store-and-forward principles that tightly couple TCP connections at intermediate end-systems impose fundamental performance limitations, such as dragging down all transfer rates in the system to the rate of the slowest receiver. In contrast, the ROMA architecture we propose incorporates the use of loosely coupled TCP connections together with fast forward error correction techniques to deliver a scalable solution that better accommodates a set of heterogeneous receivers. The methods we develop establish chains of TCP connections, whose expected performance we analyze through equation-based methods. We validate our analytical findings and evaluate the performance of our ROMA architecture using a prototype implementation via extensive Internet experimentation across the PlanetLab distributed testbed.},

Though spanning trees of arbitrary type could be used to construct an overlay mesh, we focus on a distributed algorithm that computes k minimum spanning trees on an arbitrary graph. The principal motivation behind this strategy is to provide applications with a k-redundant, high quality mesh suitable for demanding applications like A/V broadcast, video conferencing, data collection, multi-path routing, and file mirroring/transfer.

abstract={A moderate amount of recent work has been dedicated to using overlay network to support value-added network service, such as overlay multicast, OverQoS, etc. Overlay service network is a generic service framework which is designed to provide a variety of services to overlay service customers. To design an overlay service network, the first step is to choose an overlay topology connecting all the overlay service nodes. For example, RON [Anderson, DG et al., 2001] has used full mesh topology connecting all the nodes. In this paper, we did a study on the impact of topology on the overlay routing service. We found that the overlay topology has significant impact on the overlay routing in terms of routing performance and routing overhead. For example, the full mesh topology does not always give us the best performance. Moreover, the physical topology information can benefit us a lot to construct an efficient overlay topology. In addition, some alternative topologies can provide us with better performance when considering both the routing performance and overhead.},

year={2004},

number={},
pages={430},
abstract={This study provides some new insights into the scalability of reliable group communication mechanisms using overlays. These mechanisms use individual TCP connections for packet transfers between end-systems. End-systems store incoming packets and forward them to downstream nodes using different unicast TCP connections. In this paper we assume that buffers in end-systems are large enough for the transfers. It is shown that the throughput of the reliable overlay group communication scales in the sense that for all multicast tree sizes and topologies, the group throughput is strictly positive under natural conditions. This is in contrast with the IP supported multicast paradigm where reliable protocols have vanishing throughput when the group size tends to infinity. The scalability of packet delay and buffer occupancy is then investigated. In the absence of additional control, the occupancy of the buffer and the latency in the end-systems explodes with time. It is then shown that proactive rate throttle mechanism implemented at the source leads to finite packet latency and buffer occupancy in any end-system of the network provided certain moment conditions are satisfied by cross traffic in the routers.},

abstract={We propose a new localized structure, namely, Incident MST and RNG Graph (IMRG), for topology control and broadcasting in wireless ad hoc networks. In the construction algorithm, each node first builds a modified relative neighborhood graph (RNG'), and then informs its one-hop neighbors its incident edges in RNG'. Each node then collects all its one-hop neighbors and the two-hop neighbors who have RNG edges to some of its one-hop neighbors, and builds an Euclidean minimum spanning tree of these nodes. Each node u keeps an edge uv only if uv is in the constructed minimum spanning tree. We analytically prove that the node degree of the IMRG is at most 6, it is connected and planar, and more importantly, the total edge length of the IMRG is within a constant factor of that of the minimum spanning tree. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that can construct a structure with all these properties using small communication messages (at most 13n total messages, each with O(logn) bits) and small computation cost, where n is the number of wireless nodes. Test results are corroborated in the simulation study.},

abstract={Throughput capacity is a critical parameter for the design and evaluation of ad-hoc wireless networks. Consider n identical randomly located nodes, on a unit area, forming an ad-hoc wireless network. Assuming a fixed per node transmission capability of T hits per second at a fixed range, it has been shown that the uniform throughput capacity per node r(n) is /spl otimes/(T//spl radic/nlogn). We consider an alternate communication model, with each node constrained to a maximum transmit power P/sub 0/ and capable of utilizing W Hz of bandwidth. Under the limiting case W/spl rarr//spl infin/, such as in ultra wide band networks, the uniform throughput per node is /spl otimes/((nlogn)/sup /spl alpha/-1/2/ (upper bound) and /spl Omega/(n/sup (/spl alpha/-1)/2//(logn)/sup (/spl alpha/+1)/2/) (achievable lower bound). These bounds demonstrate that throughput increases with node density n, in contrast to previously published results. This is the result of the large bandwidth, and the assumed power and rate adaptation, which alleviate interference. Thus, the significance of physical layer properties on the capacity of ad-hoc wireless networks is demonstrated.},

We first apply our technique to the random waypoint model and provide alternative proofs for previous claims about the discrepancy between the steady state average speed and the average speed associated with the simulated distribution (Yoon, J et al., 2003). Our main contribution is a new methodology for simulating mobility which guarantees steady state for node movement distributions from the start of the simulation. Our methodology enables the correct and efficient simulation of a desired steady state distribution, and can be implemented in a manner transparent to the user. We support our claims through both formal proofs as well as extensive simulations.},

abstract={Gupta and Kumar (2000) introduced a random network model for studying the way throughput scales in a wireless network when the nodes are fixed, and showed that the throughput per source-destination pair is /spl otimes/(1//spl radic/nlogn). Grossglauser and Tse (2001) showed that when nodes are mobile it is possible to have a constant or /spl otimes/(1) throughput scaling per source-destination pair. The focus of this paper is on characterizing the delay and determining the throughput-delay trade-off in such fixed and mobile ad hoc networks. For the Gupta-Kumar fixed network model, we show that the optimal throughput-delay trade-off is given by D(n) = /spl otimes/(nT(n)), where T(n) and D(n) are the throughput and delay respectively. For the Grossglauser-Tse mobile network model, we show that the delay scales as /spl otimes/(n/sup 1/2//v(n)), where v(n) is the velocity of the mobile nodes. We then describe a scheme that achieves the optimal order of delay for any given throughput. The scheme varies (i) the number of hops, (ii) the transmission range and (iii) the degree of node mobility to achieve the optimal throughput-delay trade-off. The scheme produces a range of models that capture the Gupta-Kumar model at one extreme and the Grossglauser-Tse model at the other. In the course of our work, we recover previous results of Gupta and Kumar, and Grossglauser and Tse using simpler techniques, which might be of a separate interest.},

On the contrary, if the attenuation function does not have a singularity at the origin and is uniformly bounded, we obtain bounds on the percolation domain for large node densities, which show that either the network becomes disconnected, or the available rate per node decreases like 1/n.},

year={2004},
volume={1},

pages={494},
abstract={In WDM networks with limited drop-offs, the route of a multicast connection consists of a set of light-trees. Each of the light-tree is rooted at the source node and contains no more than a limited number, say k, destination nodes due to the power loss of dropping optical signals off at destination nodes. We call such a light-tree k-drop light-tree. In this paper we study the multicast routing problem of constructing a set of k-drop light-trees that have the minimal network cost. The network cost of a set of light-trees is defined as the summation of the link cost of all the light-trees. We first prove that this problem is polynomial-time solvable for k=2 and NP-hard for k/spl ges/3. We then propose a 4-approximation algorithm for the problem for k /spl ges/3. A wavelength assignment algorithm is also proposed to assign wavelengths to the light-trees of a multicast connection. In the end we give simulation results showing that k-drop multitree muting can significantly save not only the network cost but also wavelengths used. Moreover, when k/spl ges/5 its performance is very close to the case where k is infinite (i.e., the case of using a single tree for a multicast connection).},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the traffic grooming, routing, and wavelength assignment (GRWA) problem for optical mesh networks. In most previous studies on optical mesh networks, traffic demands are usually assumed to be wavelength demands, in which case no traffic grooming is needed. In practice, optical networks are typically required to carry a large number of lower rate (sub-wavelength) traffic demands. Hence, the issue of traffic grooming becomes very important since it can significantly impact the overall network cost. In our study, we consider traffic grooming in combination with traffic routing and wavelength assignment. Our objective is to minimize the total number of transponders required in the network. We first formulate the GRWA problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Unfortunately, for large networks it is computationally infeasible to solve the ILP problem. Therefore, we propose a decomposition method that divides the GRWA problem into two smaller problems: the traffic grooming and routing problem and the wavelength assignment problem, which can then be solved much more efficiently. In general, the decomposition method only produces an approximate solution for the GRWA problem. However, we also provide some sufficient condition under which the decomposition method gives an optimal solution. Finally, some numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.},

abstract={Single-hop WDM networks with a central passive star coupler (PSC), as well as single-hop networks with a central arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) and a single transceiver at each node, have been extensively studied as solutions for the quickly increasing amounts of unicast and multicast traffic in the metropolitan area. The main bottlenecks of these networks are the lack of spatial wavelength reuse in the studied PSC based networks and the single transceiver in the studied AWG based metro WDM networks. In this paper we develop and evaluate the FTλ-FRλAWG network, which is based on a central AWG and has arrays of fixed-tuned transmitters and receivers at each node. Transceiver arrays are a mature technology, making the proposed network practical. In addition, the transmitter arrays allow for high speed signaling over the AWG while the receiver arrays relieve the receiver bottleneck arising from multicasting in conjunction with spatial wavelength reuse on the AWG. Our results from probabilistic analysis and simulation indicate that the FTλ-FRλAWG network gives particularly good throughput-delay performance for multicast traffic with small multicast group sizes or localized destination nodes, as well as for a mix of unicast and multicast traffic.},

pages={523},
abstract={We consider an IP/MPLS over WDM network, in which label switched routers (LSRs) in the IP/MPLS layer are interconnected through optical cross-connects (OXCs) in the optical core network (WDM layer) providing an end-to-end wavelength routing capability. In this paper, we study a dynamic label switched path (LSP) provisioning problem for the three different network models of the IP/MPLS over WDM network, namely, overlay, augmented, and peer models. For the overlay model, we propose an algorithm, called MLH/spl I.bar/OVLY, in which a network finds a path with the minimum number of logical hops for an LSP request. We also propose, for the augmented model, a simple and efficient dynamic LSP provisioning algorithm, called CAPA/spl I.bar/AUG, utilizing summarized capacity information from the WDM layer. We compare the proposed algorithms with the existing algorithms available for the overlay and peer models, and also provide an in-depth analysis of the algorithms. The algorithms are compared and evaluated using two key performance measures: LSP blocking probability and network (lightpath) utilization. Simulation results show that at low loads with a limited number of ports available in the network, CAPA/spl I.bar/AUG achieves an order of magnitude better blocking performance and outperforms all other algorithm. Considering the small amount of information that is exchanged between the layers in the augmented model, these results suggest that the augmented model can be a practically good compromise between the overlay and peer models.},

number={},
pages={535},
abstract={In a WDM optical network, each fiber link can carry a certain set of wavelengths /spl Lambda/= {/spl lambda//sub 1/,/spl lambda//sub 2/,...,/spl lambda//sub W/}. One scheme for tolerating a single link failure (or node failure) in the network is the path protection scheme, which establishes an active path and a link-disjoint (or node-disjoint) backup path, so that in the event of a link failure (node failure) on the active path, data can be quickly re-routed through the backup path. We consider a dynamic scenario, where requests to establish active-backup paths between a specified source-destination node pair arrive sequentially. If a link-disjoint (node-disjoint) active-backup path pair is found at the time of the request, the paths are established; otherwise, the request is blocked. In this scenario, at the time a request arrives, not every fiber link will have all W wavelengths available for new call establishment, as some of the wavelengths may already have been allocated to earlier requests and communication through these paths may still be in progress. We assume that the network nodes do not have any wavelength converters. This paper studies the existence of a pair of link-disjoint (node-disjoint) active-backup paths satisfying the wavelength continuity constraint between a specified source-destination node pair. First we prove that both the link-disjoint and node-disjoint versions of the problem are NP-complete. Then we focus on the link-disjoint version and present an approximation algorithm and an exact algorithm for the problem. Finally, through our experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that our approximation algorithm produces near-optimal solutions in almost all of the instances of the problem in a fraction of the time required by the exact algorithm.},

We consider three information query strategies: (i) a source-only search, where the source (user) tries to locate the destination by initiating query which propagates as a continuous time random walk (Brownian motion); (ii) a source and receiver driven "sticky" search, where both the source and the destination send a query or an advertisement (both propagating as random walks), and these leave a "sticky" trail to aid in locating the destination; and (iii) where the destination information is spatially cached (i.e., repeated over space), and the source tries to locate any one of the caches. For a source-only search, we show that the probability that a query is unsuccessful decays as (log (t))-1. When both the source and the destination send queries or advertisements, we show that the probability that a query is unsuccessful decays as t-5/8. Further, faster polynomial decay rates can be achieved by using a finite number of queries or advertisements. Finally, when a spatially periodic cache is employed, we show that the probability that a query is unsuccessful decays no faster than t-1. Thus, we can match the decay rates of the source and the destination driven search with that of a spatial caching strategy by using an appropriate number of queries. This indicates that the appropriate strategy for querying over large sensor networks would be to use multiple queries and advertisements using the "sticky" search strategy.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider dense wireless sensor networks deployed to observe multiple random processes. The requirement is to reconstruct an estimate of each random process at the corresponding collector node. This leads to multiple many-to-one data gathering wireless channels that interfere with one another. We derive the transport capacity that the network can provide to each process and characterize an achievable rate region for the dense multimodal network. We further investigate the number of processes that can be observed simultaneously by the network. Specifically, we show that it is possible to observe O (N/sup /spl beta//) processes simultaneously such that the transport capacity scales as /spl Theta/ (log (N)) for each of the observed processes, with a large number of sensors A; and a fixed total average power. We show this result using a simple scheme based on antenna sharing. We then proceed to show that it is possible to simultaneously observe O (N/sup /spl beta//) continuous, spatially bandlimited Gaussian processes using a fixed total average power, through a scheme composed of single dimensional quantization, distributed Slepian-Wolf source coding, and the proposed antenna sharing strategy.},

abstract={We consider the problem of positioning data collecting base stations in a sensor network. We show that in general, the choice of positions has a marked influence on the data rate, or equivalently, the power efficiency, of the network. In our model, which is partly motivated by an experimental environmental monitoring system, the optimum data rate for a fixed layout of base stations can be found by a maximum flow algorithm. Finding the optimum layout of base stations, however, turns out to be an NP-complete problem, even in the special case of homogeneous networks. Our analysis of the optimum layout for the special case of the regular grid shows that all layouts that meet certain constraints are equally good. We also consider two classes of random graphs, chosen to model networks that might be realistically encountered, and empirically evaluate the performance of several base station positioning algorithms on instances of these classes. In comparison to manually choosing positions along the periphery of the network or randomly choosing them within the network, the algorithms tested find positions, which significantly improve the data rate and power efficiency of the network.},

abstract={To achieve security in wireless sensor networks, it is important to he able to encrypt messages sent among sensor nodes. Keys for encryption purposes must he agreed upon by communicating nodes. Due to resource constraints, achieving such key agreement in wireless sensor networks is nontrivial. Many key agreement schemes used in general networks, such as Diffie-Hellman and public-key based schemes, are not suitable for wireless sensor networks. Pre-distribution of secret keys for all pairs of nodes is not viable due to the large amount of memory used when the network size is large. Recently, a random key pre-distribution scheme and its improvements have been proposed. A common assumption made by these random key pre-distribution schemes is that no deployment knowledge is available. Noticing that in many practical scenarios, certain deployment knowledge may be available a priori, we propose a novel random key pre-distribution scheme that exploits deployment knowledge and avoids unnecessary key assignments. We show that the performance (including connectivity, memory usage, and network resilience against node capture) of sensor networks can he substantially improved with the use of our proposed scheme. The scheme and its detailed performance evaluation are presented in this paper.},

We investigate the basic transmission power control for the 802.11 MAC protocols in which the control frames and the data frames can be transmitted at different power levels. A collision model together with an interference model of a uniformly distributed network is constructed. Based on these models, the end-to-end network throughput and the total energy consumption of the network are examined. For a network with a given node density, our results show the optimal transmission power for control messages and for data messages that will yield maximum throughput and minimum energy consumption per message.},

abstract={We study wireless ad hoc networks with a large number of nodes. We first focus on a network of n immobile nodes, each with a destination node chosen in random. We develop a scheme under which, in the absence of fading, the network can provide each node with a traffic rate /spl lambda//sub 1/(n)=K/sub 1/(nlog n)/sup -1/ 2/. This result was first shown in J. Hightower and G. Borriello (2001) under a similar setting, however the proof presented here is shorter and uses only basic probability tools. We then proceed to show that, under a general model of fading, each node can send data to its destination with a rate /spl lambda//sub 2/(n)=K/sub 2/n/sup -1// /sup 2/(log n)/sup -3/2/. Next, we extend our formulation to study the effects of node mobility. We first develop a simple scheme under which each of the a mobile nodes can send data to a randomly chosen destination node with a rate /spl lambda//sub 3/(n)=K/sub 3/n/sup -1/2/(log n)/sup -3/2/, and with a fixed upper bound on the packet delay d/sub max/ that does not depend on n. We subsequently develop a scheme under which each of the nodes can send data to its destination with a rate /spl lambda//sub 4/(n)=K/sub 4/n/sup (d-1)/ 2/(log n)/sup -5/ 2 /provided that nodes are willing to tolerate packet delays smaller than d/sub max/(n)<K/sub 5/n/sup d/, where 0<d<1. With both schemes, a general model of fading is assumed. In addition, nodes require no global topology or routing information, and only need to coordinate locally. The above results hold for an appropriate choice of values for the constants K/sub i/, and with probability approaching 1 as the number of nodes n approaches infinity.},

volume={1},
number={},
pages={628},
abstract={This paper describes a location system using an asynchronous distributed sensor network. The sensors' clocks operate independently and are not explicitly synchronized. The motion of the source, or the object, between two emitted pulses will cause the inter-arrival time of these two pulses at each sensor to vary. This inter-arrival time is a function of the source location and motion and is independent of the clock offsets among sensors. Thus, the independently calculated time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) of successive pulses at each sensor provides a reliable source of information to estimate the source position as well as its motion. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to assess the performance of the proposed method and to show that its performance can approach that of a synchronous network given a sufficient number of sensors and moderate source movement. Some sub-optimal but effective source trajectory tracking methods are proposed which further relax the assumption of source motion between consecutive pulses. The simulation results show that the proposed estimation and tracking methods are quite good.},

pages={640},
abstract={Prolonged network lifetime, scalability, and load balancing are important requirements for many ad-hoc sensor network applications. Clustering sensor nodes is an effective technique for achieving these goals. In this work, we propose a new energy-efficient approach for clustering nodes in ad-hoc sensor networks. Based on this approach, we present a protocol, HEED (hybrid energy-efficient distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of their residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its neighbors or node degree. HEED does not make any assumptions about the distribution or density of nodes, or about node capabilities, e.g., location-awareness. The clustering process terminates in O(1) iterations, and does not depend on the network topology or size. The protocol incurs low overhead in terms of processing cycles and messages exchanged. It also achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. A careful selection of the secondary clustering parameter can balance load among cluster heads. Our simulation results demonstrate that HEED outperforms weight-based clustering protocols in terms of several cluster characteristics. We also apply our approach to a simple application to demonstrate its effectiveness in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting data aggregation.},

abstract={A method for efficient short messages transmission in cellular networks is developed in this study. The number of short message service (SMS) messages is growing very rapidly, and existing cellular networks have to support a large number of SMS and signaling messages. The rate of SMS messages has already exceeded the rate of E-mail messages transmitted through the Internet, and their number keeps growing. SMS messages are characterized by a burst of a short, single packet message. Unfortunately, the protocols currently used by existing cellular networks cannot support this type of traffic efficiently. For this reason, SMS messages are currently transmitted through the signaling channel. Clearly, this usage of the signaling channel is far from being optimal, in terms of network resources utilization. Under certain conditions, it may even block the signaling channel. This study proposes to use a load-adaptive multiple access with congestion avoidance (LAMA/CA) for efficient short messages transmission in cellular networks. The LAMA/CA protocol is more stable, and much more efficient for transmitting SMS messages and signaling messages, than the existing method currently used in cellular networks. Moreover, the proposed method is superior to a collision-free protocol that uses a request to send (RTS) and clear to send (CTS) mechanism, over the range of packet lengths used for SMS messages and signaling messages.},

abstract={In this work, we study and quantify the effects of hotspots in wireless cellular networks. Hotspots are caused when the bandwidth resources available at some location in the network are not enough to sustain the needs of the users, which are then blocked or dropped. A deeper understanding of hotspots can help in conducting more realistic simulations and enable improved network design. We identify some causes for the formation of hotspots and based on them, categorize hotspots into three different types: a) capacity based, b) delay based, and c) preferential mobility based. We show how these types have different effects on network performance. We also consider the effects of hotspots from various perspectives such as the number of hotspots, the placement of hotspots, etc. We also develop a fluid flow model and an analytical model to study hotspots. The fluid flow model is surprisingly simple yet effective in helping us understand hotspots and their properties. We also describe an analytical model in which we consider a cell as an M/M/B/B queue. We use these models to substantiate some of the observations from the simulations.},

abstract={Wireless networks have a lot of geometric properties since the signal strength corresponds directly to the distance. Earlier research findings in geometry, such as Voronoi diagram, have found a lot of applications in wireless networks. In this paper, a new geometric diagram, referred to as the umbrella diagram, is proposed. The umbrella diagram is comparable to the Voronoi diagram. The Voronoi diagram deals with a set of points, whereas the umbrella diagram deals with a set of different networks. The umbrella diagram of a set of hexagonal networks is to divide the plane into regions such that the points in a region have a larger distance to one network than to the other networks. Unlike the Voronoi diagram, the regions in the umbrella diagram are not necessarily convex. The paper gives an efficient solution to compute the umbrella diagram of n networks with the same cell size and orientation. Like the Voronoi diagram, the umbrella diagram has potential to be used in many areas. To illustrate its usefulness, the paper further gives two applications in wireless networks: the optimal network deployment and the maximum base station reuse. The optimal network deployment intends to find the best position to fix the network such that the network is closest to all existing base stations. The maximum base station reuse problem is to maximize the number of base stations that can be reused under a given bound.},

abstract={In this paper we study the computational complexity and effectiveness of a concept, we term "N-hub shortest-path routing" in IP networks. N-hub shortest-path routing allows the ingress node of a routing domain to determine up to N intermediate nodes ("hubs") through which a packet will traverse before reaching its final destination. This facilitates better utilization of the network resources, while allowing the network routers to continue to employ the simple and well-known shortest-path routing paradigm. This concept has been suggested in the past but this paper is the first to offer an in-depth investigation of it. We apply this concept to the routing problem of minimizing the maximum load in the network. We show that the resulting routing problem is a difficult (NP-complete) problem and that it is also hard to approximate. However, we propose efficient algorithms for solving this problem both in the online and the offline contexts. Our results show that N-hub shortest-path routing can increase the network utilization significantly even for N=1. Hence, this routing paradigm should be considered as a powerful mechanism for the future datagram routing in the Internet.},

abstract={Finding a disjoint path pair is an important component in survivable networks. Since the traffic is carried on the active (working) path most of the time, it is useful to find a disjoint path pair such that the length of the shorter path (to be used as the active path) is minimized. In this paper, we first address such a minmin problem. We prove that this problem is NP-complete in either single link cost (e.g. dedicated backup bandwidth) or dual link cost (e.g. shared backup bandwidth) networks. In addition, it is NP-hard to obtain a k-approximation to the optimal solution for any k>1. Our proof is extended to another open question regarding the computational complexity of a restricted version of the min-sum problem in an undirected network with ordered dual cost links (called MSOD problem). To solve the minmin problem efficiently, we introduce a novel concept called conflicting link set which provides insights into the so-called trap problem, and develop a divide-and-conquer strategy. The result is an effective heuristic for the minmin problem called COLE, which can outperform other approaches in terms of both the optimality and running time. We also apply COLE to the MSOD problem to efficiently provide shared path protection and conduct comprehensive performance evaluation as well as comparison of various schemes for shared path protection. We show that COLE not only processes connection requests much faster than existing ILP based approaches but also achieves a good balance among the AP length, bandwidth efficiency and recovery time.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an optimization based approach for quality of service routing in high-bandwidth networks. We view a network that employs QoS routing as an entity that distributively optimizes some global utility function. By solving the optimization problem, the network is driven to an efficient operating point. In earlier work, it has been shown that when the capacity of the network is large, this optimization takes on a simple form, and once the solution to this optimization problem is found, simple proportional QoS routing schemes will suffice. However, this optimization problem requires global information. We develop a distributed and adaptive algorithm that can efficiently solve the optimization online. Compared with existing QoS routing schemes, the proposed optimization based approach has the following advantages: (1) The computation and communication overhead can be greatly reduced without sacrificing performance; (2) The operating characteristics of the network can be analytically studied; and (3) The desired operating point can be tuned by choosing appropriate utility functions.},

abstract={Networks are expected to meet a growing volume of requirements imposed by new applications such as multimedia streaming and video conferencing. Two essential requirements are support of quality of service (QoS) and resilience to failures. In order to satisfy these requirements, a common approach is to use two disjoint paths between the source and the destination nodes, the first serving as a primary path and the second as a restoration path. Such approach, referred to as path restoration, has several advantages, the major one being the ability to switch promptly from one path to another in the event of a failure. A major issue in this context is how to identify two paths that satisfy the QoS constraints imposed by network applications. Since network resources, e.g., bandwidth, are allocated along both primary and restoration paths, we need to consider also the overall network performance. Accordingly, in this paper we study the fundamental problem of finding two disjoint paths that satisfy the QoS constraints at minimum cost. We present approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees for this fundamental network problem.},

abstract={The recent reduction in telecommunications spending has increased the importance of network planning to improve the return on investment on the existing network infrastructures. Therefore, tools that help in maximizing the bandwidth efficiency of the network at a minimum cost are essential. Previous work in this area focused on increasing bandwidth efficiency and reliability. In this work, in addition to increasing the bandwidth efficiency, we address the complexity of network management and operations. This issue is explicitly addressed by our novel framework, a simple polynomial time algorithm (SimPol) that achieves optimum network performance (in terms of congestion or bandwidth consumption) using only a small number of paths. The problem formulation is based on splittable multicommodity flows. Using SimPol we show that the total number of paths is at most k+m, where k and m are the numbers of demands and edges in the network, respectively. We extend the basic framework into an integer programming formulation to address the tradeoff between network congestion and the total number of paths. We also use SimPol to address the problem of implementing path/link policies such as bandwidth-limited paths. The performance of SimPol is evaluated through extensive simulations. Using the integer programming approach, we can get exactly one path while losing about 10% to 50% in congestion depending on the number of demands. This congestion is, however, far better than the traditional shortest path routing. The framework is general and can be used in capacity planning for transport networks such as MPLS and ATM.},
