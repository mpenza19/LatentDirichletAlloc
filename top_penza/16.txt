The reactivation-failure of PUs is the incident that the SUs cannot detect the PUs' reactivation when the SUs are occupying the channels to transmit their data in non-time-slotted CRNs. The frequently unexpected handoffs among SUs are the events that the SU cannot distinguish between the PUs' reactivation and the other SUs' contention, thus causing many unexpected hand-offs among SUs, which severely degrade the achieved throughput of SUs in non-time-slotted CRNs.

Tobe', u'title': u'Link correlation aware opportunistic routing', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'By exploiting reception diversity of wireless network links, researchers have shown that opportunistic routing can improve network performance significantly over traditional routing schemes. However, recently empirical studies indicate that we are too optimistic, i.e. diversity gain can be overestimated if we continue to assume that packet receptions of wireless links are independent events. For the first time, this paper formally analyzes the opportunistic routing gain under the presence of link correlation considering the loss of DATA and ACK packets. Based on the model, we introduce a new link-correlation-aware opportunistic routing scheme, which improves the performance by exploiting the diverse uncorrelated forwarding links. Our design is evaluated using simulation where we show (i) link correlation leads to less diversity gain, (ii) and with our link-correlation-aware design; improvement can be gained. We also provide a unique model to generate strings of randomly correlated receptions.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'3036-3040', u'year': u'2012', u'keywords': u'diversity reception;radio links;radio networks;telecommunication network routing;link correlation-aware opportunistic routing scheme;reception diversity;wireless network links;network performance improvement;diversity gain;packet receptions;link correlation;opportunistic routing gain;data packet;ACK packet;diverse-uncorrelated forwarding links;link-correlation-aware design;Correlation;Routing;Wireless networks;Measurement;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols', 'ID': u'6195754', u'booktitle': u'2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

Whitehouse', u'title': u'Flash Flooding: Exploiting the Capture Effect for Rapid Flooding in Wireless Sensor Networks', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'We present the Flash flooding protocol for rapid network flooding in wireless sensor networks. Traditional flooding protocols can be very slow because of neighborhood contention: nodes cannot propagate the flood until neighboring nodes have finished their transmissions. The Flash flooding protocol avoids this problem by allowing concurrent transmissions among neighboring nodes. It relies on the capture effect to ensure that each node receives the flood from at least one of its neighbors, and introduces new techniques to either recover from or prevent too many concurrent transmissions. We evaluate the Flash flooding protocol on both a 48-node wireless sensor network testbed and in a trace-based simulator. Our results indicate that the Flash flooding protocol can reduce latency by as much as 80%, achieving flooding latencies near the theoretical lower bound without sacrificing coverage, reliability or power consumption.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'2491-2499', u'year': u'2009', u'keywords': u'protocols;wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor networks;flash flooding protocol;rapid network flooding;neighborhood contention:;latency reduction;flooding latencies;Wireless sensor networks;Floods;Delay;Protocols;Peer to peer computing;Relays;Energy consumption;Propagation losses;Testing;Event detection', 'ID': u'5062177', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2009'}
