The underlying motivation is the design and analysis of piece selection protocols for peer-to-peer networks which disseminate files by dividing them into pieces. We first investigate one-sided protocols, where piece selection is based on the states of either the transmitter or the receiver. We show that any such protocol relying only on pushes, or alternatively only on pulls, will be inefficient in disseminating all pieces to all users. We propose a hybrid one-sided piece selection protocol -INTERLEAVE -and show that by using both pushes and pulls it disseminates k pieces from a single source to n users in 10(k + log n) time, while obeying the constraint that each user can upload at most one piece in one unit of time. An optimal, unrealistic centralized protocol would take k + log<sub>2</sub> n time in this setting. Moreover, efficient dissemination is also possible if the source implements forward erasure coding, and users push the latest-released coded pieces (but do not pull). We also investigate two-sided protocols where piece selection is based on the states of both the trasmitter and the receiver. We show that it is possible to disseminate n pieces to n users in + O(log n) time, starting from an initial state where each user has a unique piece.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'May', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'2135-2143', u'year': u'2007', u'keywords': u'peer-to-peer computing;one-sided piece selection protocol;peer-to-peer network;unrealistic centralized protocol;forward erasure coding;information dissemination;Protocols;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Robustness;Communications Society;Transmitters;IP networks;Telecommunication traffic;Load management;Relays', 'ID': u'4215829', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2007 - 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}

Lakshman', u'title': u'Building Scalable Virtual Routers with Trie Braiding', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Many popular algorithms for fast packet forwarding and filtering rely on the tree data structure. Examples are the trie-based IP lookup and packet classification algorithms. With the recent interest in network virtualization, the ability to run multiple virtual router instances on a common physical router platform is essential. An important scaling issue is the number of virtual router instances that can run on the platform. One limiting factor is the amount of high-speed memory and caches available for storing the packet forwarding and filtering data structures. An ideal goal is to achieve good scaling while maintaining total isolation amongst the virtual routers. However, total isolation requires maintaining separate data structures in high-speed memory for each virtual router. In this paper, we study the case where some sharing of the forwarding and filtering data structures is permissible and develop algorithms for combining tries used for IP lookup and packet classification. Specifically, we develop a mechanism called trie-braiding that allows us to combine tries from the data structures of different virtual routers into just one compact trie. Two optimal braiding algorithms are presented and the effectiveness is demonstrated using the real world data sets.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2010', u'keywords': u'IP networks;telecommunication network routing;tree data structures;trees (mathematics);virtual reality;building scalable virtual routers;tree data structure;trie-based IP lookup;packet classification algorithms;high-speed memory;real world data sets;Data structures;Virtual private networks;Platform virtualization;Filtering algorithms;Routing protocols;Scalability;Communications Society;Buildings;Tree data structures;Classification algorithms', 'ID': u'5461960', u'booktitle': u'2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

This paper investigates the topological structure of the Internet in terms of customer-provider and peer-peer relationships between autonomous systems, as manifested in BGP routing policies. We describe a technique for inferring AS relationships by exploiting partial views of the AS graph available from different vantage points. Next we apply the technique to a collection of ten BGP routing tables to infer the relationships between neighboring autonomous systems. Based on these results, we analyze the hierarchical structure of the Internet and propose a five-level classification of AS. Our characterization differs from previous studies by focusing on the commercial relationships between autonomous systems rather than simply the connectivity between the nodes.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'June', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'618-627 vol.2', u'year': u'2002', u'keywords': u'telecommunication network routing;Internet;network topology;telecommunication traffic;protocols;Internet hierarchy;autonomous systems;border gateway protocol;topological structure;customer-provider relationships;peer-peer relationships;BGP routing policies;Peer to peer computing;Web and internet services;Telecommunication traffic;Routing protocols;Computer science;IP networks;Contracts;Network topology;Performance analysis', 'ID': u'1019307', u'booktitle': u'Proceedings.Twenty-First Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies'}

Meiners', u'title': u'Firewall Compressor: An Algorithm for Minimizing Firewall Policies', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u"A firewall is a security guard placed between a private network and the outside Internet that monitors all incoming and outgoing packets. The function of a firewall is to examine every packet and decide whether to accept or discard it based upon the firewall's policy. This policy is specified as a sequence of (possibly conflicting) rules. When a packet comes to a firewall, the firewall searches for the first rule that the packet matches, and executes the decision of that rule. With the explosive growth of Internet-based applications and malicious attacks, the number of rules in firewalls have been increasing rapidly, which consequently degrades network performance and throughput. In this paper, we propose Firewall Compressor, a framework that can significantly reduce the number of rules in a firewall while keeping the semantics of the firewall unchanged. We make three major contributions in this paper. First, we propose an optimal solution using dynamic programming techniques for compressing one-dimensional firewalls. Second, we present a systematic approach to compressing multi-dimensional firewalls. Last, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate Firewall Compressor. In terms of effectiveness, Firewall Compressor achieves an average compression ratio of 52.3% on real- life rule sets. In terms of efficiency, Firewall Compressor runs in seconds even for a large firewall with thousands of rules. Moreover, the algorithms and techniques proposed in this paper are not limited to firewalls. Rather, they can be applied to other rule-based systems such as packet filters on Internet routers.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'176-180', u'year': u'2008', u'keywords': u'authorisation;data compression;dynamic programming;Internet;telecommunication security;firewall compressor;private network;Internet;dynamic programming;IP networks;Communications Society;Computer science;Computer security;Computer displays;Explosives;Degradation;Throughput;Dynamic programming;Knowledge based systems', 'ID': u'4509639', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications'}

The arriving packets are modeled as the random points of a homogeneous Poisson point process distributed within a unit interval. The minimum information required is equal to the minimum entropy of a random partition that separates the points of the Poisson point process. Only a lower bound of this minimum is known in previous work. We provide an upper bound of this minimum entropy, and the gap with the existing lower bound is shown to be smaller than log<sub>2</sub> e bits. The upper bound asymptotically achieves the minimum entropy required to resolve per unit traffic.
