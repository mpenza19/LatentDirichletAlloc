Sides', u'title': u'DDoS attack on cloud auto-scaling mechanisms', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Auto-scaling mechanisms are an important line of defense against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) in the cloud. Using auto-scaling, machines can be added and removed in an on-line manner to respond to fluctuating load. It is commonly believed that the auto-scaling mechanism casts DDoS attacks into Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks. Rather than suffering from performance degradation up to a total denial of service, the victim suffers only from the economic damage incurred by paying for the extra resources required to process the bogus traffic of the attack. Contrary to this belief, we present and analyze the Yo-Yo attack, a new attack against the auto-scaling mechanism, that can cause significant performance degradation in addition to economic damage. In the Yo-Yo attack, the attacker sends periodic bursts of overload, thus causing the auto-scaling mechanism to oscillate between scale-up and scale-down phases. The Yo-Yo attack is harder to detect and requires less resources from the attacker compared to traditional DDoS. We demonstrate the attack on Amazon EC2 [4], and analyze protection measures the victim can take by reconfiguring the auto-scaling mechanism.', u'issn': '', u'number': '', u'month': u'May', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2017', u'keywords': u'cloud computing;computer network security;Yo-Yo attack;auto-scaling mechanism;DDoS attack;cloud auto-scaling mechanisms;distributed denial of service attack;economic denial of sustainability attack;EDoS attack;Amazon EC2;Computer crime;Cloud computing;Economics;Adaptive systems;Conferences;Google;Sustainable development;Cloud attack;Auto-scaling;Denial-of-service attack;Economic-Denial-of-Sustainability attack;Distributed systems security', 'ID': u'8057010', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications'}

We analyze three standardized and commonly deployed routing mechanisms that we term "node-pair discovery" primitives. We show that use of these primitives inherently yields inferior route selection, irrespective of the protocol that implements them. This behavior originates due to overhead reduction actions that systematically yield insufficient distribution of routing information, effectively hiding available paths from nodes. To address this problem, we propose a set of "deter and rescue" routing primitives that enable nodes to discover their hidden paths by exploiting already available historic routing information. We use extensive measurements on a large operational wireless mesh network to show that with node-pair discovery primitives, inferior route selections occur regularly and cause long-term throughput degradations for network users. In contrast, the deter and rescue primitives largely identify and prevent selection of inferior paths. Moreover, even when inferior paths are selected, the new primitives reduce their duration by several orders of magnitude, often to sub-second time scales.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-9', u'year': u'2010', u'keywords': u'telecommunication network routing;wireless mesh networks;routing primitives;wireless mesh networks;multi-hop;node-pair discovery primitives;inferior route selections;Wireless mesh networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Throughput;Telecommunication traffic;Costs;Communications Society;Spread spectrum communication;Degradation;Mesh networks', 'ID': u'5462111', u'booktitle': u'2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}

However, none of these approaches protects bidders' privacy. In this paper, we present SPRING, which is the first Strategy-proof and PRivacy preservING spectrum auction mechanism.

La Porta', u'title': u'Channelization for Network Coding in Wireless Networks', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Network coding is increasingly being investigated as an alternative to routing to increase throughput in packet networks. Like most data transfer schemes, the effectiveness of network coding may be limited by extreme congestion. When using network coding, these congested conditions are mitigated somewhat, but may still occur. We propose a selective channelization scheme in which links that experience congestion at a level that cannot be overcome by network coding are given reserved communication resources. This method has the following benefits. First, the algorithm proposed allows network coding full opportunity to overcome congestion before performing channelization, thus reducing the number of reserved resources used. Second, when triggered, the channelization of severely congested links greatly improves the end-to-end performance of flows that traverse the channelized link. To determine the point at which channelization should be triggered, we perform a thorough analysis of potential coding gains in a network facing errors due to collisions, and determine the point at which network coding loses its effectiveness.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'366-370', u'year': u'2008', u'keywords': u'encoding;packet radio networks;telecommunication network routing;wireless channels;network coding;packet networks;wireless networks;data transfer schemes;selective channelization scheme;reserved communication resource;potential coding;network facing errors;Network coding;Wireless networks;Routing;Error analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Road accidents;Communications Society;Computer science;Throughput;Telecommunication congestion control', 'ID': u'4509677', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications'}

With tens of CDNs competing for content producers, it is important to understand the game played by these CDNs and whether the game is sustainable in the long term. In this paper, we formulate a game-theoretic model to analyze price competition among CDNs. Under this model, we propose an optimal strategy employed by two-CDN games. The strategy is incentive-compatible since any CDN that deviates from the strategy ends up with a lower utility. The strategy is also efficient since it produces a total utility that is at least two thirds of the social optimal utility. We formally derive the sufficient conditions for such a strategy to exist, and empirically show that there exists an optimal strategy for the games with more than two CDNs.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'3207-3212', u'year': u'2013', u'keywords': u'game theory;Internet;pricing;content producers;incentive-compatible strategy;sufficient conditions;social optimal utility;two-CDN games;price competition analysis;game-theoretic model;content availability improvement;user-perceived response time improvement;Internet traffic;content delivery networks;CDN pricing game;Games;Markov processes;Equations;Pricing;Internet;Conferences;Servers', 'ID': u'6567139', u'booktitle': u'2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}
