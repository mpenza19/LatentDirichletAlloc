Veitch', u'title': u'Temporal Delay Tomography', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'inproceedings', u'abstract': u'Multicast-based network tomography enables inference of average loss rates and delay distributions of internal network links from end-to-end measurements of multicast probes. Recent work showed that this method, based on correlating observations of multicast receivers, also supports the inference of temporal loss characteristics of network links. In this paper, we show that temporal characteristics can, in fact, be estimated even for link delay processes. Knowledge of temporal delay characteristics has applications for delay sensitive services such as VoIP as well as for characterizing the queueing behavior of bottleneck links. By assuming mutually independent, but arbitrary link delay processes, we develop estimators which can infer, in addition to delay distributions, the probabilities of arbitrary patterns of delay, means and full distributions of delay-run periods at chosen delay levels, for each link in the multicast tree. By applying the recently proposed principle of subtree-partitioning, the estimator is made scalable to multicast trees of large degree. Estimation error and convergence rates are evaluated using simulations.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'276-280', u'year': u'2008', u'keywords': u'delays;multicast communication;parameter estimation;statistical distributions;telecommunication network topology;trees (mathematics);temporal delay tomography;multicast-based network tomography;link delay processes;delay distributions;probability;multicast tree;subtree-partitioning;estimation error;convergence rates;temporal parameter estimation;Tomography;Delay estimation;Added delay;Virtual private networks;Delay effects;Statistical distributions;Communications Society;USA Councils;Loss measurement;Probes', 'ID': u'4509659', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications'}

Ideally, these applications can be developed using standard middleware components like CORBA to improve their quality and reduce their cost and cycle time. However, stringent constraints on memory available in embedded systems imposes a severe limit on the footprint of CORBA middleware. This paper provides three contributions to the study and design of small footprint, embedded CORBA middleware. First, we describe the optimizations used to develop the protocol engine and CORBA IDL compiler provided by TAO, which is our real-time CORBA implementation. TAO's IDL compiler produces stubs that can use either compiled and/or interpretive marshalling. Second, we compare the performance and footprint of TAO IDL compiler-generated stubs and skeletons that use compiled and/or interpretive marshalling for a wide range of IDL data types. Third, we illustrate the benefits of the small footprint and efficiency of TAO IDL compiler-generated stubs and skeletons for CORBA object services implemented using TAO. The results comparing the performance of the compiled and interpretive stubs and skeletons indicate that the interpretive stubs and skeletons perform between 75-100% of the compiled stubs and skeletons for a wide range of data types. However the code size for the interpreted stubs and skeletons was between 26-45% and 50-80% of the compiled stubs and skeletons, respectively. These results indicate a positive step towards implementing high performance, small footprint middleware for distributed embedded systems.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'March', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'513-521 vol.2', u'year': u'1999', u'keywords': u'distributed object management;client-server systems;embedded systems;telecommunication computing;program compilers;network operating systems;protocols;land mobile radio;distributed embedded systems;CORBA middleware optimisation;real-time operating systems;Inferno Windows CE;EPOC;Palm OS;mobile communication applications;electronic mail;Internet browsing;network management;standard middleware components;cost reduction;cycle time reduction;protocol engine;IDL compiler;TAO;stubs;interpretive marshalling;performance;skeletons;IDL data types;small footprint;efficiency;object services;code size;Middleware;Skeleton;Embedded system;Communication industry;Electronics industry;Real time systems;Operating systems;Mobile communication;Electronic mail;IP networks', 'ID': u'751385', u'booktitle': u"IEEE INFOCOM '99.

The overall delay of all VoIP flows drastically increases when the number of VoIP sources approaches the capacity, due to the characteristics of CSMA/CA. We propose a novel call admission control with the Queue size Prediction using Computation of Additional Transmission (QP-CAT) to avoid admitting an excessive number of simultaneous calls. In QP-CAT, an AP can accurately predict the effect of new VoIP flows on the delay of existing VoIP flows by predicting its queue size, before the new VoIP flow is actually admitted. It can be easily extended to support 802.11e so that the AP can predict the effect even when background traffic exists with VoIP traffic under 802.11e.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'726-734', u'year': u'2008', u'keywords': u'carrier sense multiple access;Internet telephony;quality of service;queueing theory;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN;call admission control;IEEE 802.11 WLAN;QP-CAT;QoS;CSMA/CA;queue size prediction;VoIP traffic flow;Call admission control;Quality of service;Downlink;Traffic control;Wireless networks;Telecommunication traffic;Delay estimation;Delay effects;Protection;Admission control', 'ID': u'4509718', u'booktitle': u'IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications'}

We wonder whether it is feasible to use such distributed solution for bandwidth estimation. This requires that each peer determines its bandwidth vector by measuring the direct and reverse bandwidth on its path with each landmark. The bandwidth vectors of two peers are then used to estimate the bandwidth between them in both ways. For a couple of peers, we denote by (i) direct path the network path that joins them directly using IP routing, and by (ii) indirect path the path that joins them via a landmark node. N indirect paths (N being the number of landmarks) are assigned to each direct path. Our idea is to estimate the bandwidth of the direct path using those of the indirect paths. The indirect paths that have more links common with the direct path, are assigned more weight in the estimation function. We consider different estimation functions and we study the impact of the landmarks' locations on the accuracy of the estimations.", u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'1-2', u'year': u'2006', u'keywords': u'bandwidth allocation;electromagnetic interference;estimation theory;IP networks;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication network routing;vectors;end-to-end bandwidth inference;peer-to-peer network;landmark approach;direct bandwidth estimation;reverse bandwidth estimation;bandwidth vector;IP routing;Bandwidth;Delay estimation;Peer to peer computing;Extraterrestrial measurements;Vectors;Routing;Internet;Equations;Tellurium;Euclidean distance', 'ID': u'4146716', u'booktitle': u'Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications'}

Building effective DR mechanisms and user awareness on power consumption can significantly benefit from fine-grained monitoring of user consumption at the appliance level. However, installing and maintaining such a monitoring infrastructure in residential settings can be quite expensive. In this paper, we study the problem of fine-grained appliance power-consumption monitoring based on one house-level meter and few plug-level meters. We explore the trade-off between monitoring accuracy and cost, and exhaustively find the minimum subset of plug-level meters that maximize accuracy. As exhaustive search is time- and resource-consuming, we define a heuristic approach that finds the optimal set of plug-level meters without utilizing any other sets of plug-level meters. Based on experiments with real data, we found that few plug-level meters - when appropriately placed - can very accurately disaggregate the total real power consumption of a residential setting and verified the effectiveness of our heuristic approach.', u'issn': u'0743-166X', u'number': '', u'month': u'April', u'volume': '', u'pages': u'3177-3182', u'year': u'2013', u'keywords': u'demand side management;heuristic programming;power consumption;sustainable development;heuristic approach;plug-level meters;house-level meter;fine-grained appliance;demand response mechanisms;energy demand;energy needs;residential settings;sustainable energy consumption monitoring;Home appliances;Hidden Markov models;Monitoring;Accuracy;Power demand;Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Energy disaggregation;Hidden Markov Models;FHMM;NILM;plug-level meter', 'ID': u'6567134', u'booktitle': u'2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM'}
