Dominant Strategy Allocation of Divisible Network Resources with Limited Information Exchange. game theory; resource allocation; telecommunication network management; Nash equilibria; communication requirements; socially optimal outcome; incentive issue; Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism; competing agents; limited information exchange; divisible network resources; dominant strategy allocation; VCG mechanism; single divisible resource; incentive guarantees; Resource management; Optimization; Conferences; Information exchange; Nash equilibrium; Electronic mail; Bandwidth. A fundamental problem in many network systems is how to allocate limited resources among competing agents, who may have their own incentives. The well-known Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism provides an elegant solution to this incentive issue. In particular, VCG implements the socially optimal outcome in dominant strategies. However, it is also well-known that this mechanism can require an excessive amount of communication. Approaches have been studied that relax the communication requirements while also relaxing the incentive guarantees to use Nash equilibria instead of dominant strategies. Here, we take a different approach and study mechanisms with limited information that still have dominant strategy outcomes, but suffer an efficiency loss. We characterize this loss for the case of a single divisible resource. We first consider a mechanism in which information is limited by quantizing the resource into a finite number of units and allocating each of these to one agent via a VCG mechanism. This limits each agent to submitting a finite number of real values. We subsequently consider the case where each value is also quantized before being reported by each agent. Finally, we present numerical examples of the performance of these mechanisms.

In spectrum trading markets, auctions are organized by spectrum holders (SHs) to distribute channels. As buyers, wireless service providers (WSPs) acquire channels to deploy services to end users. To optimize the profits, it is essential for the WSPs to determine their bidding strategies, which are affected by two key aspects: the service position to the end users and the auction schemes enforced by the SH. In this paper, we jointly study the strategy of the SH in the auction design and the WSPs' strategies in the service provisions and biddings. The WSP's optimal strategy in the auction can be flexible in term of demands and valuations. To optimize social welfare and enable the WSPs to reveal truthful flexible demands, we design Flexauc, a novel auction mechanism for the SH. We prove theoretically that Flexauc not only maximizes the social welfare but also preserves other nice properties: truthfulness and computational tractability.

As more applications and businesses move to the cloud, pricing for inter-datacenter links has become an important problem. In this paper, we study revenue maximizing pricing from the perspective of a network provider in inter-datacenter networks. Designing a practical bandwidth pricing scheme requires us to jointly consider the requirements of envy-freeness and arbitrage-freeness, where envy-freeness guarantees the fairness of resource allocation and arbitrage-freeness induces users to truthfully reveal their data transfer requests. Considering the non-convexity of the revenue maximization problem and the lack of information about the users' utilities, we propose a framework for computationally efficient pricing to approximately maximize revenue in a range of environments. We first study the case of a single link accessed by many users, and design a (1 + E)-approximation pricing scheme with polynomial time complexity and information complexity. Based on dynamic programming, we then extend the pricing scheme for the tollbooth network, preserving the (1 + E) approximation ratio and the computational complexity. For the general network setting, we analyze the revenue generated by uniform pricing, which determines a single per unit price for all potential users. We show that when users have similar utilities, uniform pricing can achieve a good approximation ratio, which is independent of network topology and data transfer requests. The pricing framework can be extended to multiple time slots, enabling time-dependent pricing.

Towards Profit Maximization for Online Social Network Providers. advertising data processing; information dissemination; profitability; social networking (online); OSN provider; advertiser; product information; viral marketing campaigns; influence maximization algorithms; profit maximization; online social network providers; influence propagation; information dissemination; Measurement; Social network services; Diffusion processes; Conferences; Electronic mail; Approximation algorithms; Integrated circuit modeling. Online Social Networks (OSNs) attract billions of users to share information and communicate where viral marketing has emerged as a new way to promote the sales of products. An OSN provider is often hired by an advertiser to conduct viral marketing campaigns. The OSN provider generates revenue from the commission paid by the advertiser which is determined by the spread of its product information. Meanwhile, to propagate influence, the activities performed by users such as viewing video ads normally induce diffusion cost to the OSN provider. In this paper, we aim to find a seed set to optimize a new profit metric that combines the benefit of influence spread with the cost of influence propagation for the OSN provider. Under many diffusion models, our profit metric is the difference between two submodular functions which is challenging to optimize as it is neither submodular nor monotone. We design a general two-phase framework to select seeds for profit maximization and develop several bounds to measure the quality of the seed set constructed. Experimental results with real OSN datasets show that our approach can achieve high approximation guarantees and significantly outperform the baseline algorithms, including state-of-the-art influence maximization algorithms.

We consider a general small-scale market for agent-to-agent resource sharing, in which each agent could either be a server (seller) or a client (buyer) in each time period. In every time period, a server has a certain amount of resources that any client could consume, and randomly gets matched with a client. Our target is to maximize the resource utilization in such an agent-to-agent market, where the agents are strategic. During each transaction, the server gets money and the client gets resources. Hence, trade ratio maximization implies efficiency maximization of our system. We model the proposed market system through a Mean Field Game approach and prove the existence of the Mean Field Equilibrium, which can achieve an almost 100% trade ratio. Finally, we carry out a simulation study motivated by an agent-to-agent computing market, and a case study on a proposed photovoltaic market, and show the designed market benefits both individuals and the system as a whole.

Stimulating both service users and service providers is of paramount importance to mobile crowdsourcing. A few incentive mechanisms have been proposed, but all of them have focused only on one-sided interactions either among service users or among service providers. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we investigate the important two-sided online interactions among service users and service providers in mobile crowdsourcing. We model such interactions as online double auctions, explicitly taking the dynamic nature of both users and providers into account We propose a general framework for the design of truthful online double auctions for dynamic mobile crowdsourcing. The framework is expressive and can work with different price schedules. We propose price-ranked online double auctions with four price schedules to implement the framework, which are suitable for different scenarios. With theoretical analysis and extensive simulations we demonstrate that the proposed auctions are strategy-proof, individual rational, and ensure budget balance.
