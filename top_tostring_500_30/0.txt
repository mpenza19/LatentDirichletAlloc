This paper deals with a new approach to integrate congestion control for real-time applications and elastic traffic into a unified framework. In our previous work, we proposed a new fairness criterion, utility proportional fairness, that takes characteristics of real-time applications into account. We complement this framework by deriving a general method to generate utility functions for layered multimedia applications. Finally, we demonstrate our approach through ns-simulations.

An adaptive connection admission control policy for VBR/sup +/ service class. telecommunication congestion control; multimedia communication; visual communication; telecommunication traffic; asynchronous transfer mode; adaptive control; adaptive connection admission control; VBR/sup +/ service class; multimedia applications; ATM networks; dynamic resource renegotiation; usage parameter controls; network resource utilization; statistical multiplexing; connection admission controller; bandwidth renegotiation; dynamic resource partitioning; dynamic resource redistribution; simulation results; performance; VBR service; video sources; Programmable control; Adaptive control; Admission control; Bandwidth; Communication system traffic control; Resource management; Quality of service; National electric code; Robust control; Traffic control. A new service class, called VBR/sup +/ has been proposed for multimedia applications on ATM networks. VBR/sup +/ extends the functionality of the traditional VBR service with the added capability of dynamic resource renegotiation. It makes the specification and modification of the usage parameter controls flexible, and potentially can increase the network resource utilization through statistical multiplexing. These advantages come at the expense of a more complex connection admission controller which should be designed to handle bandwidth renegotiation efficiently. A connection admission controller for the VBR/sup +/ service class is proposed. We identify the desirable features of a VBR/sup +/ connection admission controller, and present a novel one that can achieve them through (1) dynamic resource partitioning, and (2) dynamic resource redistribution among active connections. Simulation results showing the performance of the controller using a number of actual video traces are presented. The results show that the controller is robust in admitting a variety of video sources with widely different traffic burstiness. By partitioning the resource pool dynamically, and distributing resources among contending connections fairly, it can maintain very good quality, and can achieve high utilization. Comparison with the traditional VBR service reveals that the CAC is able to provide comparable quality with higher network utilization.

QOS provisioning in micro-cellular networks supporting multimedia traffic. telecommunication congestion control; multimedia communication; resource allocation; cellular radio; telecommunication traffic; packet switching; scheduling; QOS; micro-cellular networks; multimedia traffic; adaptive call admission control mechanism; wireless networks; mobile networks; resource sharing schemes; wireless bandwidth; call arrival rates; traffic conditions; analytical methodology; bottlenecks; network call control functions; scheduling; Intelligent networks; Telecommunication traffic; Communication system traffic control; Resource management; Call admission control; Quality of service; Wireless networks; Base stations; Admission control; Programmable control. We introduce an adaptive call admission control mechanism for wireless/mobile networks supporting multimedia traffic, and discuss a number of resource sharing schemes which can be used to allocate wireless bandwidth to different classes of traffic. The adaptive call admission control reacts to changing new call arrival rates, and the resource sharing mechanism reacts to rapidly changing traffic conditions in every radio cell due to mobility of mobile users. In addition, we have provided an analytical methodology which shows that the combination of the call admission control and the resource sharing schemes guarantees a predefined quality-of-service to each class of traffic. One major advantage of our approach is that it can be performed in a distributed fashion removing any bottlenecks that might arise due to frequent invocation of network call control functions.

The authors use adaptive feedback and adaptive feedforward control methodologies to avoid congestion at high server utilisation. This addresses the combined connection admission and flow control problem (generic functions for managing and controlling traffic and congestion in BISDN). Using a novel control concept, based on only two groups of traffic (controllable and uncontrollable) they formulate a problem aimed at high (unity) utilisation of resources while maintaining quality of service at prescribed levels. Bounds on operating conditions are derived, and using simulation they show that high utilisation can be achieved as suggested by the theory, together with robustness for unforeseen traffic connections and disconnections. Even with such a high efficiency and strong properties on the quality of service, the only traffic descriptor required from the user is that of the peak rate of the uncontrollable traffic.

The differentiated services framework (DiffServ) has been proposed to provide multiple quality of service (QoS) classes over IP networks. A network supporting multiple classes of service also requires a differentiated pricing structure. We propose a pricing scheme in a DiffServ environment based on the cost of providing different levels of quality of service to different classes, and on long-term demand. Pricing of network services dynamically based on the level of service, usage, and congestion allows a more competitive price to be offered, allows the network to be used more efficiently, and provides a natural and equitable incentive for applications to adapt their service contract according to network conditions. We develop a DiffServ simulation framework to compare the performance of a network supporting congestion-sensitive pricing and adaptive service negotiation to that of a network with a static pricing policy. Adaptive users adapt to price changes by adjusting their sending rate or selecting a different service class. We also develop the demand behavior of adaptive users based on a perceptually reasonable user utility function. Simulation results show that a congestion-sensitive pricing policy coupled with user rate adaptation is able to control congestion and allow a service class to meet its performance assurances under large or bursty offered loads, even without explicit admission control. Users are able to maintain a stable expenditure. Allowing users to migrate between service classes in response to price increases further stabilizes the individual service prices. When admission control is enforced, congestion-sensitive pricing still provides an advantage in terms of a much lower connection blocking rate at high loads.

Dynamic connection management for call-level QOS guarantee in integrated communication networks. telecommunication network management; telecommunication services; telecommunications control; dynamic connection management; call-level QOS guarantee; integrated communication networks; network resources allocation; performance parameter; call setup; dynamic networking; quality of service; call establishment; connection-oriented network; connection failure recovery; call preemption recovery; network overload; Intelligent networks; Communication networks; Resource management; Quality of service; Degradation; Telecommunication traffic; Transfer functions; Delay; Satellites; Communication switching. Conventional allocation of network resources for connection management is by and large static. For each performance parameter that is negotiated during a call setup, its agreed value must be maintained throughout the duration of the call. Due to a dynamic networking environment, the result of quality of service (QOS) negotiation during call establishment may not remain ideal throughout the duration of a call. The authors propose a method for managing connections, in a connection-oriented integrated communication network, to maintain acceptable QOS for the entire duration of each connection, to make QOS improvements whenever possible, to recover from connection failures and call preemption, as well as to partially retrieve allocated resources to relieve network overload.
