An exact analysis is presented for the 2*2 switching element with input port buffers that use the cell bypass queueing discipline. An approximate analysis is developed for the Banyan network composed of 2*2 switching elements with buffers that use the cell bypass queuing discipline. An investigation is made of the effect of this discipline on performance through numerical results obtained by analyses as well as simulation results. The authors also examine the nonuniform input traffic models. The analysis shows that the cell bypass queuing discipline considerably improves the performance of the ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) switches based on Banyan networks with respect to both throughput and cell blocking probability.

Mixed continuous-bit-rate (CBR) and bursty traffic contending for transmission on any output line of a broadband switch based on the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is modeled as a superposition of traffic from a number of independent random and binary sources. With the use of a recursive algorithm, a complete queuing analysis is presented. The queue length distribution, the delay distribution, and the cell loss probability for a finite buffer system are exactly calculated. Cases considered and analyzed include: delay priority for CBR traffic, absolute cell loss priority for DS1/DS3 emulation or guaranteed bandwidth CBR traffic with a stringent cell loss requirement, and threshold cell dropping for voice CBR traffic with a high degree of cell loss tolerance.

Performance of a crosspoint buffered ATM switch fabric. asynchronous transfer mode; switching networks; telecommunication traffic; crosspoint buffered ATM switch fabric; queuing analysis; banyan switch fabrics; 2*2 switching elements; PHOENIX switching element; throughput; uniform traffic conditions; bursty traffic; speedup factor; delay; packet loss probability; buffer space; burst size; Switches; Asynchronous transfer mode; Fabrics; Traffic control; Queueing analysis; Analytical models; Throughput; Telecommunication traffic; Delay; Performance loss. The authors present a queuing analysis and a simulation study of banyan switch fabrics based on 2*2 switching elements with crosspoint buffering. In particular, the results apply to the PHOENIX switching element based banyan fabrics. The results indicate that crosspoint buffering provides throughput approaching the offered load under uniform traffic conditions. The effect of bursty traffic on the performance of the switch is studied. It is shown that a speedup factor of three or more is required to achieve acceptable delay and packet loss probability. It is also shown that the amount of buffer space required per port increases linearly with the burst size for a desired packet loss performance. For a given burst size the packet loss rate decreases exponentially as the buffer size is increased. The impact of crosspoint buffering and shared buffering in the switching elements on the performance of the banyan fabric is analyzed.

Approximate analysis of the end-to-end delay in ATM networks. asynchronous transfer mode; delays; queueing theory; telecommunication networks; telecommunication traffic; ATM networks; general approach; approximate analysis; end-to-end delay jitter; asynchronous transfer mode; bursty input traffic; cell loss requirements; complementary probability distribution function; cell loss probability; reassembly buffer; isolated network node; reference connection; maximum transfer delay; one queuing; Intelligent networks; Asynchronous transfer mode; Traffic control; Jitter; Propagation delay; Queueing analysis; B-ISDN; Bit rate; Added delay; Communication system traffic control. A very general approach for an approximate analysis of end-to-end delay jitter in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks for bursty input traffic is presented. Since the cell loss requirements within ATM networks are very restrictive, interest is in the tail of the complementary probability distribution function of the end-to-end delay to estimate the cell loss probability at the reassembly buffer. An analytical approach for an isolated network node as well as for a whole reference connection is presented. The approximation results are in good agreement with simulation results and indicate that the end-to-end delay jitter is in the range of the maximum transfer delay of one queuing node, if the bursty input traffic is controlled by adequate traffic control mechanisms.

Performance of a packet switch with input and output queueing under unbalanced traffic. packet switching; queueing theory; telecommunication traffic; input queueing; input ports; output queueing; unbalanced traffic; packet switches; output port; performance study; fixed-size packets; average delay; maximum throughput; output traffic imbalance; saturation load; input traffic imbalance; output sharing; Switches; Packet switching; Traffic control; Throughput; Delay; Performance analysis; Buffer overflow. High performance in advanced packet switches can be achieved by providing queuing both at the input and the output ports. The author studies the performance of this class of switches under nonuniform traffic. Two different output queuing arrangements are considered, namely, the case where dedicated queues are provided at each output port, and the case where the output queuing space is shared among all the output ports. An analytical approach is presented for the performance study of these two schemes in the case of operation with fixed-size packets and under various degrees of traffic imbalance at the inputs or the outputs. The measures investigated include the average delay, the maximum throughput of the switch in the case of output traffic imbalance, and the saturation load in the case of input traffic imbalance. Analytical results for these measures are derived for the case of a switch with a large number of input and output ports. Numerical results for the maximum throughput and the saturation load are presented. It is demonstrated that the scheme of output sharing performs better than the scheme of dedicated output queuing.

Performance analysis of parallel ATM connections for gigabit speed applications. asynchronous transfer mode; wide area networks; bursty traffic; performance analysis; parallel ATM connections; gigabit speed applications; asynchronous transfer mode; virtual circuits; parallel channels; channel delay; packet loss; resequencing delay; nonbursty traffic; mean; variance; packet delay; ATM switch; burst size; delay distribution; normal distribution; buffer size; Performance analysis; Asynchronous transfer mode; Delay; Circuits; Switches; Control systems; Wide area networks; Performance loss; Traffic control; Packet switching. A system which uses multiple asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) virtual circuits operating in parallel in order to control two WAN hosts at gigabit speeds is studied. Packets in parallel channels can bypass each other, so reordering of packets before delivery to the host is required. Performance parameters of this system, including ATM channel delay, packet loss, and resequencing delay, are analyzed, using a model for an ATM channel that multiplexes ATM virtual circuits carrying bursty and nonbursty traffic. It is found that the mean and variance of packet delay through an ATM switch grow linearly with burst size, and that the delay distribution can be closely approximated by a normal distribution. It is shown that packet loss is log-linear in the ratio of buffer size to burst size, and for maximum bursts larger than 50 cells, a buffer size of twice the maximum burst size is sufficient to achieve packet loss probabilities less than 10/sup -9/. Resequencing delay is shown to be insensitive to burst size, but the variance is large and grows linearly with burst size.

Cell loss performance of the Gauss ATM switch. asynchronous transfer mode; electronic switching systems; probability; cell loss performance; B-ISDN; Gauss ATM switch; asynchronous transfer mode; output buffered ATM switch; load; traffic business; internal speed; cell loss probability; knockout switch; Performance loss; Gaussian processes; Asynchronous transfer mode; Switches; Telecommunication traffic; Ultra large scale integration; Protocols; Employment; Broadcasting; Very large scale integration. The authors present a performance study of the Gauss asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch with respect to cell loss. The Gauss switch is a recently proposed, high-performance, output buffered ATM switch that can easily be implemented. In general, if an ATM switch suffers from cell loss, the exact behavior of this cell loss as a function of parameters such as load, traffic business, internal speed, etc., has to be known. The study focuses on cell loss in the Gauss switch due to its reduced internal speed. Analytical results for the cell loss probability are provided and compared to corresponding quantities for the well-known knockout switch. The comparison shows that the Gauss switch yields significantly smaller cell loss probabilities than the knockout switch.

Performance improvement of fast packet switching by LDOLL queueing. asynchronous transfer mode; packet switching; queueing theory; low delay or low loss queueing policies; ATM fast packet switching; fast packet switching; LDOLL queueing; asynchronous transfer model; retrieval priority; storage priority; performance; cell loss probability; Packet switching; Asynchronous transfer mode; Delay; Traffic control; Performance loss; Performance analysis; Computational modeling; Analytical models; Queueing analysis; Switches. Low delay or low loss (LDOLL) queuing policies for asynchronous transfer model (ATM) fast packet switching allow either retrieval priority or storage priority to be given to the ATM cells of traffic streams with different performance requirements. The improvements in performance that can be achieved by using one bit in the ATM cell header to make the binary LDOLL distinction are analyzed. In the analysis, simulation of the level, where the cell transmission rate of a source may vary between zero and the peak rate and computation at the level, where queuing of individual cells is considered, are combined. It is shown that LDOLL queuing, compared with FIFO queuing in ATM switches, can reduce cell loss probability by many orders of magnitude for low loss traffic. Low delay traffic incurs a slightly higher cell loss which is compensated with a reduced cell delay mean and variance.

Performance of trunk grouping in packet switch design. electronic switching systems; packet switching; time division multiplexing; time division multiplexing; packet switch design; maximum throughput; input queue delay; packet loss rate; output trunk grouping; traffic output contentions; nonuniform traffic environment; virtual circuit; high speed network protocol design; Switches; Packet switching; Traffic control; Performance loss; System analysis and design; Performance analysis; Throughput; Queueing analysis; Delay; Telecommunication traffic. A study is made of the performance of trunk grouping in packet switch system design, with emphasis on the analysis of maximum throughput, input queue delay and packet loss rate. The trunk grouping technique can be implemented on both sides of the switch. In principle, the output trunk grouping relieves traffic output contentions, while the input trunk grouping proposed prevents individual input links from overloading. The study shows a significant advantage of both input and output trunk groupings in removing local congestions caused by individual links, especially in a highly nonuniform traffic environment. To implement trunk grouping, it is suggested to not designate the connection of each virtual circuit to individual links in high speed network protocol design.

Two mechanisms for shaping private network traffic in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) are proposed and analyzed. The shapers utilize the information about the network policer and implement a form of priority service to assure satisfactory levels of cell loss and delay for traffic streams with differing service requirements multiplexed into a policed ATM virtual path. The performance of the shapers is analyzed using stochastic-fluid methods and Markov-modulated models of bursty traffic sources. The numerical results illustrate the performance benefits and flexibility obtainable through the use of the proposed shapers in comparison to a simple policed path without traffic shaping.
